.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry allow Tcl objects to
be manipulated as string values.  They use the internal representation
of the object to store additional information to make the string
manipulations more efficient.  In particular, they make a series of
append operations efficient by allocating extra storage space for the
string so that it does not have to be copied for each append.
Also, indexing and length computations are optimized because the
Unicode string representation is calculated and cached as needed.
When using the \fBTcl_Append*\fR family of functions where the
interpreter's result is the object being appended to, it is important
to call Tcl_ResetResult first to ensure you are not unintentionally
appending to existing data in the result object.
.PP
\fBTcl_NewStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetStringObj\fR create a new object
or modify an existing object to hold a copy of the string given by
\fIbytes\fR and \fIlength\fR.  \fBTcl_NewUnicodeObj\fR and
\fBTcl_SetUnicodeObj\fR create a new object or modify an existing
object to hold a copy of the Unicode string given by \fIunicode\fR and
\fInumChars\fR.  \fBTcl_NewStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_NewUnicodeObj\fR
return a pointer to a newly created object with reference count zero.
All four procedures set the object to hold a copy of the specified
string.  \fBTcl_SetStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetUnicodeObj\fR free any
old string representation as well as any old internal representation
of the object.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetString\fR return an object's
string representation.  This is given by the returned byte pointer and
(for \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR) length, which is stored in
\fIlengthPtr\fR if it is non-NULL.  If the object's UTF string
representation is invalid (its byte pointer is NULL), the string
representation is regenerated from the object's internal
representation.  The storage referenced by the returned byte pointer
is owned by the object manager.  It is passed back as a writable
pointer so that extension author creating their own \fBTcl_ObjType\fR
will be able to modify the string representation within the
\fBTcl_UpdateStringProc\fR of their \fBTcl_ObjType\fR.  Except for that
limited purpose, the pointer returned by \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR
or \fBTcl_GetString\fR should be treated as read-only.  It is
recommended that this pointer be assigned to a (const char *) variable.
Even in the limited situations where writing to this pointer is
acceptable, one should take care to respect the copy-on-write
semantics required by \fBTcl_Obj\fR's, with appropriate calls
to \fBTcl_IsShared\fR and \fBTcl_DuplicateObj\fR prior to any
in-place modification of the string representation.
The procedure \fBTcl_GetString\fR is used in the common case
where the caller does not need the length of the string
representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetUnicodeFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetUnicode\fR return an object's
value as a Unicode string.  This is given by the returned pointer and
(for \fBTcl_GetUnicodeFromObj\fR) length, which is stored in
\fIlengthPtr\fR if it is non-NULL.  The storage referenced by the returned
byte pointer is owned by the object manager and should not be modified by
the caller.  The procedure \fBTcl_GetUnicode\fR is used in the common case
where the caller does not need the length of the unicode string
representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetUniChar\fR returns the \fIindex\fR'th character in the
object's Unicode representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRange\fR returns a newly created object comprised of the
characters between \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR (inclusive) in the
object's Unicode representation.  If the object's Unicode
representation is invalid, the Unicode representation is regenerated
from the object's string representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetCharLength\fR returns the number of characters (as opposed
to bytes) in the string object.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR appends the data given by \fIbytes\fR and
\fIlength\fR to the string representation of the object specified by
\fIobjPtr\fR.  If the object has an invalid string representation,
then an attempt is made to convert \fIbytes\fR is to the Unicode
format.  If the conversion is successful, then the converted form of
\fIbytes\fR is appended to the object's Unicode representation.
Otherwise, the object's Unicode representation is invalidated and
converted to the UTF format, and \fIbytes\fR is appended to the
object's new string representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendUnicodeToObj\fR appends the Unicode string given by
\fIunicode\fR and \fInumChars\fR to the object specified by
\fIobjPtr\fR.  If the object has an invalid Unicode representation,
then \fIunicode\fR is converted to the UTF format and appended to the
object's string representation.  Appends are optimized to handle
repeated appends relatively efficiently (it overallocates the string
or Unicode space to avoid repeated reallocations and copies of
object's string value).
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendObjToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR, but it
appends the string or Unicode value (whichever exists and is best
suited to be appended to \fIobjPtr\fR) of \fIappendObjPtr\fR to
\fIobjPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendStringsToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR
except that it can be passed more than one value to append and
each value must be a null-terminated string (i.e. none of the
values may contain internal null characters).  Any number of
\fIstring\fR arguments may be provided, but the last argument
must be a NULL pointer to indicate the end of the list.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendStringsToObjVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_AppendStringsToObj\fR
except that instead of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an
argument list.
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_AppendLimitedToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR
except that it imposes a limit on how many bytes are appended.
This can be handy when the string to be appended might be
very large, but the value being constructed should not be allowed to grow
without bound. A common usage is when constructing an error message, where the
end result should be kept short enough to be read.
Bytes from \fIbytes\fR are appended to \fIobjPtr\fR, but no more
than \fIlimit\fR bytes total are to be appended. If the limit prevents
all \fIlength\fR bytes that are available from being appended, then the
appending is done so that the last bytes appended are from the
string \fIellipsis\fR. This allows for an indication of the truncation
to be left in the string.
When \fIlength\fR is \fB-1\fR, all bytes up to the first zero byte are appended,
subject to the limit. When \fIellipsis\fR is NULL, the default
string \fB...\fR is used. When \fIellipsis\fR is non-NULL, it must point
to a zero-byte-terminated string in Tcl's internal UTF encoding.
The number of bytes appended can be less than the lesser
of \fIlength\fR and \fIlimit\fR when appending fewer
bytes is necessary to append only whole multi-byte characters.
.PP
\fBTcl_Format\fR is the C-level interface to the engine of the \fBformat\fR
command.  The actual command procedure for \fBformat\fR is little more
than
.CS
Tcl_Format(interp, Tcl_GetString(objv[1]), objc-2, objv+2);
.CE
The \fIobjc\fR Tcl_Obj values in \fIobjv\fR are formatted into a string
according to the conversion specification in \fIformat\fR argument, following
the documentation for the \fBformat\fR command.  The resulting formatted
string is converted to a new Tcl_Obj with refcount of zero and returned.
If some error happens during production of the formatted string, NULL is
returned, and an error message is recorded in \fIinterp\fR, if \fIinterp\fR
is non-NULL.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendFormatToObj\fR is an appending alternative form
of \fBTcl_Format\fR with functionality equivalent to
.CS
Tcl_Obj *newPtr = Tcl_Format(interp, format, objc, objv);
if (newPtr == NULL) return TCL_ERROR;
Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, newPtr);
return TCL_OK;
.CE
but with greater convenience and efficiency when the appending
functionality is needed.
.PP
\fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR serves as a replacement for the common sequence
.CS
char buf[SOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH];
sprintf(buf, format, ...);
Tcl_NewStringObj(buf, -1);
.CE
but with greater convenience and no need to 
determine \fBSOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH\fR. The formatting is done with the same
core formatting engine used by \fBTcl_Format\fR.  This means the set of
supported conversion specifiers is that of the \fBformat\fR command and
not that of the \fBsprintf\fR routine where the two sets differ. When a
conversion specifier passed to \fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR includes a precision,
the value is taken as a number of bytes, as \fBsprintf\fR does, and not
as a number of characters, as \fBformat\fR does.  This is done on the
assumption that C code is more likely to know how many bytes it is
passing around than the number of encoded characters those bytes happen
to represent.  The variable number of arguments passed in should be of
the types that would be suitable for passing to \fBsprintf\fR.  Note in
this example usage, \fIx\fR is of type \fBlong\fR.
.CS
long x = 5;
Tcl_Obj *objPtr = Tcl_ObjPrintf("Value is %d", x);
.CE
If the value of \fIformat\fR contains internal inconsistencies or invalid
specifier formats, the formatted string result produced by
\fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR will be an error message describing the error.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendPrintfToObj\fR is an appending alternative form
of \fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR with functionality equivalent to
.CS
Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, Tcl_ObjPrintf(format, ...));
.CE
but with greater convenience and efficiency when the appending
functionality is needed.
.VE 8.5
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR procedure changes the length of the
string value of its \fIobjPtr\fR argument.  If the \fInewLength\fR
argument is greater than the space allocated for the object's
string, then the string space is reallocated and the old value
is copied to the new space; the bytes between the old length of
the string and the new length may have arbitrary values.
If the \fInewLength\fR argument is less than the current length
of the object's string, with \fIobjPtr->length\fR is reduced without
reallocating the string space; the original allocated size for the
string is recorded in the object, so that the string length can be
enlarged in a subsequent call to \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR without
reallocating storage.  In all cases \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR leaves
a null character at \fIobjPtr->bytes[newLength]\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR is identical in function to
\fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR except that if sufficient memory to satisfy the
request cannot be allocated, it does not cause the Tcl interpreter to
\fBpanic\fR.  Thus, if \fInewLength\fR is greater than the space
allocated for the object's string, and there is not enough memory
available to satisfy the request, \fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR will take
no action and return 0 to indicate failure.  If there is enough memory
to satisfy the request, \fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR behaves just like
\fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR and returns 1 to indicate success.
.PP
The \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR function returns a new string object whose
value is the space-separated concatenation of the string
representations of all of the objects in the \fIobjv\fR
array. \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR eliminates leading and trailing white space
as it copies the string representations of the \fIobjv\fR array to the
result. If an element of the \fIobjv\fR array consists of nothing but
white space, then that object is ignored entirely. This white-space
removal was added to make the output of the \fBconcat\fR command
cleaner-looking. \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR returns a pointer to a
newly-created object whose ref count is zero.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.5
These procedures are used to create, modify, and read Tcl objects
that hold integral values.  
.PP
The different routines exist to accommodate different integral types in C
with which values might be exchanged.  The C integral types for which Tcl
provides value exchange routines are \fBint\fR, \fBlong int\fR,
\fBTcl_WideInt\fR, and \fBmp_int\fR.  The \fBint\fR and \fBlong int\fR types
are provided by the C language standard.  The \fBTcl_WideInt\fR type is a
typedef defined to be whatever signed integral type covers at least the
64-bit integer range (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807).  Depending
on the platform and the C compiler, the actual type might be
\fBlong int\fR, \fBlong long int\fR, \fBint64\fR, or something else.
The \fBmp_int\fR type is a multiple-precision integer type defined
by the LibTomMath multiple-precision integer library.  
.PP
The \fBTcl_NewIntObj\fR, \fBTcl_NewLongObj\fR, \fBTcl_NewWideIntObj\fR,
and \fBTcl_NewBignumObj\fR routines each create and return a new
Tcl object initialized to the integral value of the argument.  The
returned Tcl object is unshared.
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetIntObj\fR, \fBTcl_SetLongObj\fR, \fBTcl_SetWideIntObj\fR,
and \fBTcl_SetBignumObj\fR routines each set the value of an existing
Tcl object pointed to by \fIobjPtr\fR to the integral value provided
by the other argument.  The \fIobjPtr\fR argument must point to an
unshared Tcl object.  Any attempt to set the value of a shared Tcl object
violates Tcl's copy-on-write policy.  Any existing string representation
or internal representation in the unshared Tcl object will be freed
as a consequence of setting the new value.
.PP
The \fBTcl_GetIntFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_GetLongFromObj\fR,
\fBTcl_GetWideIntFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_GetBignumFromObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_TakeBignumFromObj\fR routines attempt to retrieve an integral
value of the appropriate type from the Tcl object \fIobjPtr\fR.  If the
attempt succeeds, then \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned, and the value is
written to the storage provided by the caller.  The attempt might
fail if \fIobjPtr\fR does not hold an integral value, or if the
value exceeds the range of the target type.  If the attempt fails,
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, and if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR.  The \fBTcl_ObjType\fR
of \fIobjPtr\fR may be changed to make subsequent calls to the
same routine more efficient. Unlike the other functions,
\fBTcl_TakeBignumFromObj\fR may set the content of the Tcl object
\fIobjPtr\fR to an empty string in the process of retrieving the
multiple-precision integer value.
.PP
The choice between \fBTcl_GetBignumFromObj\fR and
\fBTcl_TakeBignumFromObj\fR is governed by how the caller will
continue to use \fIobjPtr\fR.  If after the \fBmp_int\fR value
is retrieved from \fIobjPtr\fR, the caller will make no more
use of \fIobjPtr\fR, then using \fBTcl_TakeBignumFromObj\fR
permits Tcl to detect when an unshared \fIobjPtr\fR permits the
value to be moved instead of copied, which should be more efficient.
If anything later in the caller requires
\fIobjPtr\fR to continue to hold the same value, then
\fBTcl_GetBignumFromObj\fR must be chosen.
.PP
The \fBTcl_InitBignumFromDouble\fR routine is a utility procedure
that extracts the integer part of \fIdoubleValue\fR and stores that
integer value in the \fBmp_int\fR value \fIbigValue\fR.

.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A hash table consists of zero or more entries, each consisting of a
key and a value.  Given the key for an entry, the hashing routines can
very quickly locate the entry, and hence its value. There may be at
most one entry in a hash table with a particular key, but many entries
may have the same value.  Keys can take one of four forms: strings,
one-word values, integer arrays, or custom keys defined by a
Tcl_HashKeyType structure (See section \fBTHE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE
STRUCTURE\fR below). All of the keys in a given table have the same
form, which is specified when the table is initialized.
.PP
The value of a hash table entry can be anything that fits in the same
space as a
.QW "char *"
pointer.  Values for hash table entries are
managed entirely by clients, not by the hash module itself.  Typically
each entry's value is a pointer to a data structure managed by client
code.
.PP
Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries increases, so
that there are always less than three entries per hash bucket, on
average. This allows for fast lookups regardless of the number of
entries in a table.
.PP
The core provides three functions for the initialization of hash
tables, Tcl_InitHashTable, Tcl_InitObjHashTable and
Tcl_InitCustomHashTable.
.PP
\fBTcl_InitHashTable\fR initializes a structure that describes a new
hash table.  The space for the structure is provided by the caller,
not by the hash module.  The value of \fIkeyType\fR indicates what
kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table. All of the
key types described later are allowed, with the exception of
\fBTCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS\fR and \fBTCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_InitObjHashTable\fR is a wrapper around
\fBTcl_InitCustomHashTable\fR and initializes a hash table whose keys
are Tcl_Obj *.
.PP
\fBTcl_InitCustomHashTable\fR initializes a structure that describes a
new hash table. The space for the structure is provided by the
caller, not by the hash module.  The value of \fIkeyType\fR indicates
what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table.
\fIKeyType\fR must have one of the following values:
.IP \fBTCL_STRING_KEYS\fR 25
Keys are null-terminated strings.
They are passed to hashing routines using the address of the
first character of the string.
.IP \fBTCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS\fR 25
Keys are single-word values;  they are passed to hashing routines
and stored in hash table entries as
.QW "char *"
values.
The pointer value is the key;  it need not (and usually does not)
actually point to a string.
.IP \fBTCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS\fR 25
Keys are of arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing
and comparison is determined by \fItypePtr\fR. The Tcl_HashKeyType 
structure is described in the section 
\fBTHE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE\fR below.
.IP \fBTCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS\fR 25
Keys are pointers to an arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing
and comparison is determined by \fItypePtr\fR. The Tcl_HashKeyType 
structure is described in the section 
\fBTHE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE\fR below.
.IP \fIother\fR 25
If \fIkeyType\fR is not one of the above,
then it must be an integer value greater than 1.
In this case the keys will be arrays of
.QW int
values, where
\fIkeyType\fR gives the number of ints in each key.
This allows structures to be used as keys.
All keys must have the same size.
Array keys are passed into hashing functions using the address
of the first int in the array.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteHashTable\fR deletes all of the entries in a hash
table and frees up the memory associated with the table's
bucket array and entries.
It does not free the actual table structure (pointed to
by \fItablePtr\fR), since that memory is assumed to be managed
by the client.
\fBTcl_DeleteHashTable\fR also does not free or otherwise
manipulate the values of the hash table entries.
If the entry values point to dynamically-allocated memory, then
it is the client's responsibility to free these structures
before deleting the table.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateHashEntry\fR locates the entry corresponding to a
particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there
was not already one with the given key.
If an entry already existed with the given key then \fI*newPtr\fR
is set to zero.
If a new entry was created, then \fI*newPtr\fR is set to a non-zero
value and the value of the new entry will be set to zero.
The return value from \fBTcl_CreateHashEntry\fR is a pointer to
the entry, which may be used to retrieve and modify the entry's
value or to delete the entry from the table.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteHashEntry\fR will remove an existing entry from a
table.
The memory associated with the entry itself will be freed, but
the client is responsible for any cleanup associated with the
entry's value, such as freeing a structure that it points to.
.PP
\fBTcl_FindHashEntry\fR is similar to \fBTcl_CreateHashEntry\fR
except that it does not create a new entry if the key doesn't exist;
instead, it returns NULL as result.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetHashValue\fR and \fBTcl_SetHashValue\fR are used to
read and write an entry's value, respectively.
Values are stored and retrieved as type
.QW ClientData ,
which is
large enough to hold a pointer value.  On almost all machines this is
large enough to hold an integer value too.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetHashKey\fR returns the key for a given hash table entry,
either as a pointer to a string, a one-word
.PQ "char *"
key, or
as a pointer to the first word of an array of integers, depending
on the \fIkeyType\fR used to create a hash table.
In all cases \fBTcl_GetHashKey\fR returns a result with type
.QW "char *" .
When the key is a string or array, the result of \fBTcl_GetHashKey\fR
points to information in the table entry;  this information will
remain valid until the entry is deleted or its table is deleted.
.PP
\fBTcl_FirstHashEntry\fR and \fBTcl_NextHashEntry\fR may be used
to scan all of the entries in a hash table.
A structure of type
.QW Tcl_HashSearch ,
provided by the client,
is used to keep track of progress through the table.
\fBTcl_FirstHashEntry\fR initializes the search record and
returns the first entry in the table (or NULL if the table is
empty).
Each subsequent call to \fBTcl_NextHashEntry\fR returns the
next entry in the table or
NULL if the end of the table has been reached.
A call to \fBTcl_FirstHashEntry\fR followed by calls to
\fBTcl_NextHashEntry\fR will return each of the entries in
the table exactly once, in an arbitrary order.
It is inadvisable to modify the structure of the table, e.g.
by creating or deleting entries, while the search is in progress,
with the exception of deleting the entry returned by
\fBTcl_FirstHashEntry\fR or \fBTcl_NextHashEntry\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_HashStats\fR returns a dynamically-allocated string with
overall information about a hash table, such as the number of
entries it contains, the number of buckets in its hash array,
and the utilization of the buckets.
It is the caller's responsibility to free the result string
by passing it to \fBckfree\fR.
.PP
The header file \fBtcl.h\fR defines the actual data structures
used to implement hash tables.
This is necessary so that clients can allocate Tcl_HashTable
structures and so that macros can be used to read and write
the values of entries.
However, users of the hashing routines should never refer directly
to any of the fields of any of the hash-related data structures;
use the procedures and macros defined here.
.SH "THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE"
.PP
Extension writers can define new hash key types by defining four procedures,
initializing a \fBTcl_HashKeyType\fR structure to describe the type, and
calling \fBTcl_InitCustomHashTable\fR. The \fBTcl_HashKeyType\fR structure is
defined as follows:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_HashKeyType {
    int \fIversion\fR;
    int \fIflags\fR;
    Tcl_HashKeyProc *\fIhashKeyProc\fR;
    Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc *\fIcompareKeysProc\fR;
    Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc *\fIallocEntryProc\fR;
    Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc *\fIfreeEntryProc\fR;
} Tcl_HashKeyType;
.CE
.PP
The \fIversion\fR member is the version of the table. If this structure is
extended in future then the version can be used to distinguish between
different structures. It should be set to \fBTCL_HASH_KEY_TYPE_VERSION\fR.
.PP
The \fIflags\fR member is 0 or one or more of the following values OR'ed
together:
.IP \fBTCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH\fR 25
There are some things, pointers for example which do not hash well because
they do not use the lower bits. If this flag is set then the hash table will
attempt to rectify this by randomizing the bits and then using the upper N
bits as the index into the table.
.IP \fBTCL_HASH_KEY_SYSTEM_HASH\fR 25
.VS 8.5
This flag forces Tcl to use the memory allocation procedures provided by the
operating system when allocating and freeing memory used to store the hash
table data structures, and not any of Tcl's own customized memory allocation
routines. This is important if the hash table is to be used in the
implementation of a custom set of allocation routines, or something that a
custom set of allocation routines might depend on, in order to avoid any
circular dependency.
.VE 8.5
.PP
The \fIhashKeyProc\fR member contains the address of a function called to
calculate a hash value for the key.
.CS
typedef unsigned int (Tcl_HashKeyProc) (
        Tcl_HashTable *\fItablePtr\fR,
        void *\fIkeyPtr\fR);
.CE
If this is NULL then \fIkeyPtr\fR is used and
\fBTCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH\fR is assumed.
.PP
The \fIcompareKeysProc\fR member contains the address of a function called to
compare two keys.
.CS
typedef int (Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc) (
        void *\fIkeyPtr\fR,
        Tcl_HashEntry *\fIhPtr\fR);
.CE
If this is NULL then the \fIkeyPtr\fR pointers are compared. If the keys do
not match then the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 1.
.PP
The \fIallocEntryProc\fR member contains the address of a function called to
allocate space for an entry and initialize the key and clientData.
.CS
typedef Tcl_HashEntry *(Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc) (
        Tcl_HashTable *\fItablePtr\fR,
        void *\fIkeyPtr\fR);
.CE
If this is NULL then Tcl_Alloc is used to allocate enough space for a
Tcl_HashEntry, the key pointer is assigned to key.oneWordValue and the
clientData is set to NULL. String keys and array keys use this function to
allocate enough space for the entry and the key in one block, rather than
doing it in two blocks. This saves space for a pointer to the key from the
entry and another memory allocation. Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to
allocate enough space for an entry and increment the reference count on the
object.
.PP
The \fIfreeEntryProc\fR member contains the address of a function called to
free space for an entry.
.CS
typedef void (Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc) (Tcl_HashEntry *\fIhPtr\fR);
.CE
If this is NULL then Tcl_Free is used to free the space for the entry.
Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to decrement the reference count on the
object.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tcl uses a two-layered channel architecture. It provides a generic upper
layer to enable C and Tcl programs to perform input and output using the
same APIs for a variety of files, devices, sockets etc. The generic C APIs
are described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR.
.PP
The lower layer provides type-specific channel drivers for each type
of device supported on each platform.  This manual entry describes the
C APIs used to communicate between the generic layer and the
type-specific channel drivers.  It also explains how new types of
channels can be added by providing new channel drivers.
.PP
Channel drivers consist of a number of components: First, each channel
driver provides a \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure containing pointers to
functions implementing the various operations used by the generic layer to
communicate with the channel driver. The \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure
and the functions referenced by it are described in the section
\fBTCL_CHANNELTYPE\fR, below.
.PP
Second, channel drivers usually provide a Tcl command to create
instances of that type of channel. For example, the Tcl \fBopen\fR
command creates channels that use the file and command channel
drivers, and the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command creates channels that use
TCP sockets for network communication.
.PP
Third, a channel driver optionally provides a C function to open
channel instances of that type. For example, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
opens a channel that uses the file channel driver, and
\fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR opens a channel that uses the TCP network
protocol.  These creation functions typically use
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR internally to open the channel.
.PP
To add a new type of channel you must implement a C API or a Tcl command
that opens a channel by invoking \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.
When your driver calls \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR it passes in
a \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure describing the driver's I/O
procedures.
The generic layer will then invoke the functions referenced in that
structure to perform operations on the channel.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR opens a new channel and associates the supplied
\fItypePtr\fR and \fIinstanceData\fR with it. The channel is opened in the
mode indicated by \fImask\fR.
For a discussion of channel drivers, their operations and the
\fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure, see the section \fBTCL_CHANNELTYPE\fR, below.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. Once a standard channel was initialized either through a
call to \fBTcl_GetStdChannel\fR or a call to \fBTcl_SetStdChannel\fR
closing this standard channel will cause the next call to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR to make the new channel the new standard
channel too. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise
about standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with
regard to them.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelInstanceData\fR returns the instance data associated with
the channel in \fIchannel\fR. This is the same as the \fIinstanceData\fR
argument in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR that created this channel.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelType\fR returns a pointer to the \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR
structure used by the channel in the \fIchannel\fR argument. This is
the same as the \fItypePtr\fR argument in the call to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR that created this channel.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelName\fR returns a string containing the name associated
with the channel, or NULL if the \fIchannelName\fR argument to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR was NULL.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR places the OS-specific device handle
associated with \fIchannel\fR for the given \fIdirection\fR in the
location specified by \fIhandlePtr\fR and returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If
the channel does not have a device handle for the specified direction,
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned instead.  Different channel drivers
will return different types of handle.  Refer to the manual entries
for each driver to determine what type of handle is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelThread\fR returns the id of the thread currently managing
the specified \fIchannel\fR. This allows channel drivers to send their file
events to the correct event queue even for a multi-threaded core.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelMode\fR returns an OR-ed combination of \fBTCL_READABLE\fR
and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR, indicating whether the channel is open for input
and output.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelBufferSize\fR returns the size, in bytes, of buffers
allocated to store input or output in \fIchannel\fR. If the value was not set
by a previous call to \fBTcl_SetChannelBufferSize\fR, described below, then
the default value of 4096 is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelBufferSize\fR sets the size, in bytes, of buffers that
will be allocated in subsequent operations on the channel to store input or
output. The \fIsize\fR argument should be between ten and one million,
allowing buffers of ten bytes to one million bytes. If \fIsize\fR is
outside this range, \fBTcl_SetChannelBufferSize\fR sets the buffer size to
4096.
.PP
\fBTcl_NotifyChannel\fR is called by a channel driver to indicate to
the generic layer that the events specified by \fImask\fR have
occurred on the channel.  Channel drivers are responsible for invoking
this function whenever the channel handlers need to be called for the
channel.  See \fBWATCHPROC\fR below for more details.
.PP
\fBTcl_BadChannelOption\fR is called from driver specific
\fIsetOptionProc\fR or \fIgetOptionProc\fR to generate a complete
error message.
.PP
\fBTcl_ChannelBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input
currently buffered in the internal buffer (push back area) of the
channel itself. It does not report about the data in the overall
buffers for the stack of channels the supplied channel is part of.
.PP
\fBTcl_IsChannelShared\fR checks the refcount of the specified
\fIchannel\fR and returns whether the \fIchannel\fR was shared among
multiple interpreters (result == 1) or not (result == 0).
.PP
\fBTcl_IsChannelRegistered\fR checks whether the specified \fIchannel\fR is
registered in the given \fIinterp\fRreter (result == 1) or not
(result == 0).
.PP
\fBTcl_IsChannelExisting\fR checks whether a channel with the specified
name is registered in the (thread)-global list of all channels (result
== 1) or not (result == 0).
.PP
\fBTcl_CutChannel\fR removes the specified \fIchannel\fR from the
(thread)global list of all channels (of the current thread).
Application to a channel still registered in some interpreter
is not allowed.
.VS 8.5
Also notifies the driver if the \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR version is
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4\fR (or higher), and
\fBTcl_DriverThreadActionProc\fR is defined for it.
.VE 8.5
.PP
\fBTcl_SpliceChannel\fR adds the specified \fIchannel\fR to the
(thread)global list of all channels (of the current thread).
Application to a channel registered in some interpreter is not allowed.
.VS 8.5
Also notifies the driver if the \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR version is
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4\fR (or higher), and
\fBTcl_DriverThreadActionProc\fR is defined for it.
.VE 8.5
.PP
\fBTcl_ClearChannelHandlers\fR removes all channel handlers and event
scripts associated with the specified \fIchannel\fR, thus shutting
down all event processing for this channel.
.SH TCL_CHANNELTYPE
.PP
A channel driver provides a \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure that contains
pointers to functions that implement the various operations on a channel;
these operations are invoked as needed by the generic layer.  The structure
was versioned starting in Tcl 8.3.2/8.4 to correct a problem with stacked
channel drivers.  See the \fBOLD CHANNEL TYPES\fR section below for
details about the old structure.
.PP
The \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure contains the following fields:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType {
        char *\fItypeName\fR;
        Tcl_ChannelTypeVersion \fIversion\fR;
        Tcl_DriverCloseProc *\fIcloseProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverInputProc *\fIinputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverOutputProc *\fIoutputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSeekProc *\fIseekProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *\fIsetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *\fIgetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverWatchProc *\fIwatchProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *\fIgetHandleProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *\fIclose2Proc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc *\fIblockModeProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverFlushProc *\fIflushProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverHandlerProc *\fIhandlerProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverWideSeekProc *\fIwideSeekProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc *\fIthreadActionProc\fR;
.VS 8.5
        Tcl_DriverTruncateProc *\fItruncateProc\fR;
.VE 8.5
} Tcl_ChannelType;
.CE
.PP
It is not necessary to provide implementations for all channel
operations.  Those which are not necessary may be set to NULL in the
struct: \fIblockModeProc\fR, \fIseekProc\fR, \fIsetOptionProc\fR,
\fIgetOptionProc\fR, and \fIclose2Proc\fR, in addition to
\fIflushProc\fR, \fIhandlerProc\fR, \fIthreadActionProc\fR, and
\fItruncateProc\fR.  Other functions that cannot be implemented in a
meaningful way should return \fBEINVAL\fR when called, to indicate
that the operations they represent are not available. Also note that
\fIwideSeekProc\fR can be NULL if \fIseekProc\fR is.
.PP
The user should only use the above structure for \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR
instantiation.  When referencing fields in a \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR
structure, the following functions should be used to obtain the values:
\fBTcl_ChannelName\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelVersion\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelBlockModeProc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelCloseProc\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelClose2Proc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelInputProc\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelOutputProc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelSeekProc\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelWideSeekProc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelThreadActionProc\fR,
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_ChannelTruncateProc\fR,
.VE 8.5
\fBTcl_ChannelSetOptionProc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelGetOptionProc\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelWatchProc\fR, \fBTcl_ChannelGetHandleProc\fR,
\fBTcl_ChannelFlushProc\fR, or \fBTcl_ChannelHandlerProc\fR.
.PP
The change to the structures was made in such a way that standard channel
types are binary compatible.  However, channel types that use stacked
channels (i.e. TLS, Trf) have new versions to correspond to the above change
since the previous code for stacked channels had problems.
.SS TYPENAME
.PP
The \fItypeName\fR field contains a null-terminated string that
identifies the type of the device implemented by this driver, e.g.
\fBfile\fR or \fBsocket\fR.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelName\fR, which returns
a pointer to the string.
.SS VERSION
.PP

The \fIversion\fR field should be set to the version of the structure
that you require. \fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2\fR is the minimum recommended.
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3\fR must be set to specify the \fIwideSeekProc\fR member.
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4\fR must be set to specify the \fIthreadActionProc\fR member
(includes \fIwideSeekProc\fR).
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_5\fR must be set to specify the
\fItruncateProc\fR members (includes
\fIwideSeekProc\fR and \fIthreadActionProc\fR).
.VE 8.5
If it is not set to any of these, then this
\fBTcl_ChannelType\fR is assumed to have the original structure.  See
\fBOLD CHANNEL TYPES\fR for more details.  While Tcl will recognize
and function with either structures, stacked channels must be of at
least \fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2\fR to function correctly.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelVersion\fR, which returns
one of
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_5\fR,
.VE 8.5
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4\fR,
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3\fR,
\fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2\fR or \fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_1\fR.
.SS BLOCKMODEPROC
.PP
The \fIblockModeProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by
the generic layer to set blocking and nonblocking mode on the device.
\fIBlockModeProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        int \fImode\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIinstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created.  The \fImode\fR
argument is either \fBTCL_MODE_BLOCKING\fR or \fBTCL_MODE_NONBLOCKING\fR to
set the device into blocking or nonblocking mode. The function should
return zero if the operation was successful, or a nonzero POSIX error code
if the operation failed.
.PP
If the operation is successful, the function can modify the supplied
\fIinstanceData\fR to record that the channel entered blocking or
nonblocking mode and to implement the blocking or nonblocking behavior.
For some device types, the blocking and nonblocking behavior can be
implemented by the underlying operating system; for other device types, the
behavior must be emulated in the channel driver.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelBlockModeProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.PP
A channel driver \fBnot\fR supplying a \fIblockModeProc\fR has to be
very, very careful. It has to tell the generic layer exactly which
blocking mode is acceptable to it, and should this also document for
the user so that the blocking mode of the channel is not changed to an
unacceptable value. Any confusion here may lead the interpreter into a
(spurious and difficult to find) deadlock.
.SS "CLOSEPROC AND CLOSE2PROC"
.PP
The \fIcloseProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by the
generic layer to clean up driver-related information when the channel is
closed. \fICloseProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverCloseProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIinstanceData\fR argument is the same as the value provided to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when the channel was created. The function should
release any storage maintained by the channel driver for this channel, and
close the input and output devices encapsulated by this channel. All queued
output will have been flushed to the device before this function is called,
and no further driver operations will be invoked on this instance after
calling the \fIcloseProc\fR. If the close operation is successful, the
procedure should return zero; otherwise it should return a nonzero POSIX
error code. In addition, if an error occurs and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL,
the procedure should store an error message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Alternatively, channels that support closing the read and write sides
independently may set \fIcloseProc\fR to \fBTCL_CLOSE2PROC\fR and set
\fIclose2Proc\fR to the address of a function that matches the
following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverClose2Proc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
        int \fIflags\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIclose2Proc\fR will be called with \fIflags\fR set to an OR'ed
combination of \fBTCL_CLOSE_READ\fR or \fBTCL_CLOSE_WRITE\fR to
indicate that the driver should close the read and/or write side of
the channel.  The channel driver may be invoked to perform
additional operations on the channel after \fIclose2Proc\fR is
called to close one or both sides of the channel.  If \fIflags\fR is
\fB0\fR (zero), the driver should close the channel in the manner
described above for \fIcloseProc\fR.  No further operations will be
invoked on this instance after \fIclose2Proc\fR is called with all
flags cleared.  In all cases, the \fIclose2Proc\fR function should
return zero if the close operation was successful; otherwise it should
return a nonzero POSIX error code. In addition, if an error occurs and
\fIinterp\fR is not NULL, the procedure should store an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
The \fIcloseProc\fR and \fIclose2Proc\fR values can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_ChannelCloseProc\fR or \fBTcl_ChannelClose2Proc\fR, which
return a pointer to the respective function.
.SS INPUTPROC
.PP
The \fIinputProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by the
generic layer to read data from the file or device and store it in an
internal buffer. \fIInputProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverInputProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        char *\fIbuf\fR,
        int \fIbufSize\fR,
        int *\fIerrorCodePtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when the channel was created.  The \fIbuf\fR
argument points to an array of bytes in which to store input from the
device, and the \fIbufSize\fR argument indicates how many bytes are
available at \fIbuf\fR.
.PP
The \fIerrorCodePtr\fR argument points to an integer variable provided by
the generic layer. If an error occurs, the function should set the variable
to a POSIX error code that identifies the error that occurred.
.PP
The function should read data from the input device encapsulated by the
channel and store it at \fIbuf\fR.  On success, the function should return
a nonnegative integer indicating how many bytes were read from the input
device and stored at \fIbuf\fR. On error, the function should return -1. If
an error occurs after some data has been read from the device, that data is
lost.
.PP
If \fIinputProc\fR can determine that the input device has some data
available but less than requested by the \fIbufSize\fR argument, the
function should only attempt to read as much data as is available and
return without blocking. If the input device has no data available
whatsoever and the channel is in nonblocking mode, the function should
return an \fBEAGAIN\fR error. If the input device has no data available
whatsoever and the channel is in blocking mode, the function should block
for the shortest possible time until at least one byte of data can be read
from the device; then, it should return as much data as it can read without
blocking.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelInputProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS OUTPUTPROC
.PP
The \fIoutputProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by the
generic layer to transfer data from an internal buffer to the output device.
\fIOutputProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverOutputProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        const char *\fIbuf\fR,
        int \fItoWrite\fR,
        int *\fIerrorCodePtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when the channel was created. The \fIbuf\fR
argument contains an array of bytes to be written to the device, and the
\fItoWrite\fR argument indicates how many bytes are to be written from the
\fIbuf\fR argument.
.PP
The \fIerrorCodePtr\fR argument points to an integer variable provided by
the generic layer. If an error occurs, the function should set this
variable to a POSIX error code that identifies the error.
.PP
The function should write the data at \fIbuf\fR to the output device
encapsulated by the channel. On success, the function should return a
nonnegative integer indicating how many bytes were written to the output
device.  The return value is normally the same as \fItoWrite\fR, but may be
less in some cases such as if the output operation is interrupted by a
signal. If an error occurs the function should return -1.  In case of
error, some data may have been written to the device.
.PP
If the channel is nonblocking and the output device is unable to absorb any
data whatsoever, the function should return -1 with an \fBEAGAIN\fR error
without writing any data.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelOutputProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS "SEEKPROC AND WIDESEEKPROC"
.PP
The \fIseekProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by the
generic layer to move the access point at which subsequent input or output
operations will be applied. \fISeekProc\fR must match the following
prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverSeekProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        long \fIoffset\fR,
        int \fIseekMode\fR,
        int *\fIerrorCodePtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIinstanceData\fR argument is the same as the value given to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created.  \fIOffset\fR and
\fIseekMode\fR have the same meaning as for the \fBTcl_Seek\fR
procedure (described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR).
.PP
The \fIerrorCodePtr\fR argument points to an integer variable provided by
the generic layer for returning \fBerrno\fR values from the function.  The
function should set this variable to a POSIX error code if an error occurs.
The function should store an \fBEINVAL\fR error code if the channel type
does not implement seeking.
.PP
The return value is the new access point or -1 in case of error. If an
error occurred, the function should not move the access point.
.PP
If there is a non-NULL \fIseekProc\fR field, the \fIwideSeekProc\fR
field may contain the address of an alternative function to use which
handles wide (i.e. larger than 32-bit) offsets, so allowing seeks
within files larger than 2GB.  The \fIwideSeekProc\fR will be called
in preference to the \fIseekProc\fR, but both must be defined if the
\fIwideSeekProc\fR is defined.  \fIWideSeekProc\fR must match the
following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef Tcl_WideInt Tcl_DriverWideSeekProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_WideInt \fIoffset\fR,
        int \fIseekMode\fR,
        int *\fIerrorCodePtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
The arguments and return values mean the same thing as with
\fIseekProc\fR above, except that the type of offsets and the return
type are different.
.PP
The \fIseekProc\fR value can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_ChannelSeekProc\fR, which returns a pointer to the function,
and similarly the \fIwideSeekProc\fR can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_ChannelWideSeekProc\fR.
.SS SETOPTIONPROC
.PP
The \fIsetOptionProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by
the generic layer to set a channel type specific option on a channel.
\fIsetOptionProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
        const char *\fIoptionName\fR,
        const char *\fInewValue\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIoptionName\fR is the name of an option to set, and \fInewValue\fR is
the new value for that option, as a string. The \fIinstanceData\fR is the
same as the value given to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was
created. The function should do whatever channel type specific action is
required to implement the new value of the option.
.PP
Some options are handled by the generic code and this function is never
called to set them, e.g. \fB\-blockmode\fR. Other options are specific to
each channel type and the \fIsetOptionProc\fR procedure of the channel
driver will get called to implement them. The \fIsetOptionProc\fR field can
be NULL, which indicates that this channel type supports no type specific
options. 
.PP
If the option value is successfully modified to the new value, the function
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
It should call \fBTcl_BadChannelOption\fR which itself returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if the \fIoptionName\fR is
unrecognized. 
If \fInewValue\fR specifies a value for the option that
is not supported or if a system call error occurs,
the function should leave an error message in the
\fIresult\fR field of \fIinterp\fR if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL. The
function should also call \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelSetOptionProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS GETOPTIONPROC
.PP
The \fIgetOptionProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by
the generic layer to get the value of a channel type specific option on a
channel. \fIgetOptionProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
        const char *\fIoptionName\fR,
        Tcl_DString *\fIoptionValue\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIOptionName\fR is the name of an option supported by this type of
channel. If the option name is not NULL, the function stores its current
value, as a string, in the Tcl dynamic string \fIoptionValue\fR.
If \fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores in \fIoptionValue\fR an
alternating list of all supported options and their current values.
On success, the function returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. 
It should call \fBTcl_BadChannelOption\fR which itself returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if the \fIoptionName\fR is
unrecognized. If a system call error occurs,
the function should leave an error message in the
result of \fIinterp\fR if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL. The
function should also call \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.
.PP
Some options are handled by the generic code and this function is never
called to retrieve their value, e.g. \fB\-blockmode\fR. Other options are
specific to each channel type and the \fIgetOptionProc\fR procedure of the
channel driver will get called to implement them. The \fIgetOptionProc\fR
field can be NULL, which indicates that this channel type supports no type
specific options.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelGetOptionProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS WATCHPROC
.PP
The \fIwatchProc\fR field contains the address of a function called
by the generic layer to initialize the event notification mechanism to
notice events of interest on this channel.
\fIWatchProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef void Tcl_DriverWatchProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        int \fImask\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIinstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created. The \fImask\fR
argument is an OR-ed combination of \fBTCL_READABLE\fR, \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR
and \fBTCL_EXCEPTION\fR; it indicates events the caller is interested in
noticing on this channel.
.PP
The function should initialize device type specific mechanisms to
notice when an event of interest is present on the channel.  When one
or more of the designated events occurs on the channel, the channel
driver is responsible for calling \fBTcl_NotifyChannel\fR to inform
the generic channel module.  The driver should take care not to starve
other channel drivers or sources of callbacks by invoking
Tcl_NotifyChannel too frequently.  Fairness can be insured by using
the Tcl event queue to allow the channel event to be scheduled in sequence
with other events.  See the description of \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR for
details on how to queue an event.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelWatchProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS GETHANDLEPROC
.PP
The \fIgetHandleProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by
the generic layer to retrieve a device-specific handle from the channel.
\fIGetHandleProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        int \fIdirection\fR,
        ClientData *\fIhandlePtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created. The \fIdirection\fR
argument is either \fBTCL_READABLE\fR to retrieve the handle used
for input, or \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR to retrieve the handle used for
output.
.PP
If the channel implementation has device-specific handles, the
function should retrieve the appropriate handle associated with the
channel, according the \fIdirection\fR argument.  The handle should be
stored in the location referred to by \fIhandlePtr\fR, and
\fBTCL_OK\fR should be returned.  If the channel is not open for the
specified direction, or if the channel implementation does not use
device handles, the function should return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelGetHandleProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS FLUSHPROC
.PP
The \fIflushProc\fR field is currently reserved for future use.
It should be set to NULL.
\fIFlushProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverFlushProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR);
.CE
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelFlushProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.
.SS HANDLERPROC
.PP
The \fIhandlerProc\fR field contains the address of a function called by
the generic layer to notify the channel that an event occurred.  It should
be defined for stacked channel drivers that wish to be notified of events
that occur on the underlying (stacked) channel.
\fIHandlerProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverHandlerProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        int \fIinterestMask\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR
when this channel was created.  The \fIinterestMask\fR is an OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_READABLE\fR or \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR; it indicates what
type of event occurred on this channel.
.PP
This value can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelHandlerProc\fR, which returns
a pointer to the function.

.SS "THREADACTIONPROC"
.PP
The \fIthreadActionProc\fR field contains the address of the function
called by the generic layer when a channel is created, closed, or
going to move to a different thread, i.e. whenever thread-specific
driver state might have to initialized or updated. It can be NULL.
The action \fITCL_CHANNEL_THREAD_REMOVE\fR is used to notify the
driver that it should update or remove any thread-specific data it
might be maintaining for the channel.
.PP
The action \fITCL_CHANNEL_THREAD_INSERT\fR is used to notify the
driver that it should update or initialize any thread-specific data it
might be maintaining using the calling thread as the associate. See
\fBTcl_CutChannel\fR and \fBTcl_SpliceChannel\fR for more detail.
.PP
.CS
typedef void Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        int        \fIaction\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created.
.PP
These values can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelThreadActionProc\fR,
which returns a pointer to the function.
.SS "TRUNCATEPROC"
.PP
The \fItruncateProc\fR field contains the address of the function
called by the generic layer when a channel is truncated to some
length. It can be NULL.
.PP
.CS
typedef int Tcl_DriverTruncateProc(
        ClientData \fIinstanceData\fR,
        Tcl_WideInt \fIlength\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIInstanceData\fR is the same as the value passed to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR when this channel was created, and
\fIlength\fR is the new length of the underlying file, which should
not be negative. The result should be 0 on success or an errno code
(suitable for use with \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR) on failure.
.PP
These values can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ChannelTruncateProc\fR,
which returns a pointer to the function.
.SH TCL_BADCHANNELOPTION
.PP
This procedure generates a
.QW "bad option"
error message in an
(optional) interpreter.  It is used by channel drivers when 
an invalid Set/Get option is requested. Its purpose is to concatenate
the generic options list to the specific ones and factorize
the generic options error message string.
.PP
It always returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
.PP
An error message is generated in \fIinterp\fR's result object to
indicate that a command was invoked with a bad option.
The message has the form
.CS
    bad option "blah": should be one of 
    <...generic options...>+<...specific options...>
.CE
so you get for instance:
.CS
    bad option "-blah": should be one of -blocking,
    -buffering, -buffersize, -eofchar, -translation,
    -peername, or -sockname
.CE
when called with \fIoptionList\fR equal to
.QW "peername sockname"
.PP
.QW blah
is the \fIoptionName\fR argument and
.QW "<specific options>"
is a space separated list of specific option words.
The function takes good care of inserting minus signs before
each option, commas after, and an
.QW or
before the last option.
.SH "OLD CHANNEL TYPES"
The original (8.3.1 and below) \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure contains
the following fields:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType {
        char *\fItypeName\fR;
        Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc *\fIblockModeProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverCloseProc *\fIcloseProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverInputProc *\fIinputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverOutputProc *\fIoutputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSeekProc *\fIseekProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *\fIsetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *\fIgetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverWatchProc *\fIwatchProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *\fIgetHandleProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *\fIclose2Proc\fR;
} Tcl_ChannelType;
.CE
.PP
It is still possible to create channel with the above structure.  The
internal channel code will determine the version.  It is imperative to use
the new \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure if you are creating a stacked
channel driver, due to problems with the earlier stacked channel
implementation (in 8.2.0 to 8.3.1).
.PP
Prior to 8.4.0 (i.e. during the later releases of 8.3 and early part
of the 8.4 development cycle) the \fBTcl_ChannelType\fR structure
contained the following fields:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType {
        char *\fItypeName\fR;
        Tcl_ChannelTypeVersion \fIversion\fR;
        Tcl_DriverCloseProc *\fIcloseProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverInputProc *\fIinputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverOutputProc *\fIoutputProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSeekProc *\fIseekProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *\fIsetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *\fIgetOptionProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverWatchProc *\fIwatchProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *\fIgetHandleProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *\fIclose2Proc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc *\fIblockModeProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverFlushProc *\fIflushProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverHandlerProc *\fIhandlerProc\fR;
        Tcl_DriverTruncateProc *\fItruncateProc\fR;
} Tcl_ChannelType;
.CE
.PP
When the above structure is registered as a channel type, the
\fIversion\fR field should always be \fBTCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These routines convert between UTF-8 strings and Tcl_UniChars.  A
Tcl_UniChar is a Unicode character represented as an unsigned, fixed-size
quantity.  A UTF-8 character is a Unicode character represented as
a varying-length sequence of up to \fBTCL_UTF_MAX\fR bytes.  A multibyte UTF-8
sequence consists of a lead byte followed by some number of trail bytes.
.PP
\fBTCL_UTF_MAX\fR is the maximum number of bytes that it takes to
represent one Unicode character in the UTF-8 representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharToUtf\fR stores the Tcl_UniChar \fIch\fR as a UTF-8 string
in starting at \fIbuf\fR.  The return value is the number of bytes stored
in \fIbuf\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToUniChar\fR reads one UTF-8 character starting at \fIsrc\fR
and stores it as a Tcl_UniChar in \fI*chPtr\fR.  The return value is the
number of bytes read from \fIsrc\fR.  The caller must ensure that the
source buffer is long enough such that this routine does not run off the
end and dereference non-existent or random memory; if the source buffer
is known to be null-terminated, this will not happen.  If the input is
not in proper UTF-8 format, \fBTcl_UtfToUniChar\fR will store the first
byte of \fIsrc\fR in \fI*chPtr\fR as a Tcl_UniChar between 0x0000 and
0x00ff and return 1.  
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharToUtfDString\fR converts the given Unicode string
to UTF-8, storing the result in a previously initialized \fBTcl_DString\fR.
You must specify \fIuniLength\fR, the length of the given Unicode string.
The return value is a pointer to the UTF-8 representation of the
Unicode string.  Storage for the return value is appended to the
end of the \fBTcl_DString\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToUniCharDString\fR converts the given UTF-8 string to Unicode,
storing the result in the previously initialized \fBTcl_DString\fR.
In the argument \fIlength\fR, you may either specify the length of
the given UTF-8 string in bytes or
.QW \-1 ,
in which case \fBTcl_UtfToUniCharDString\fR uses \fBstrlen\fR to
calculate the length.  The return value is a pointer to the Unicode
representation of the UTF-8 string.  Storage for the return value
is appended to the end of the \fBTcl_DString\fR.  The Unicode string
is terminated with a Unicode null character.
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharLen\fR corresponds to \fBstrlen\fR for Unicode
characters.  It accepts a null-terminated Unicode string and returns
the number of Unicode characters (not bytes) in that string.
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharNcmp\fR and \fBTcl_UniCharNcasecmp\fR correspond to
\fBstrncmp\fR and \fBstrncasecmp\fR, respectively, for Unicode characters.
They accept two null-terminated Unicode strings and the number of characters
to compare.  Both strings are assumed to be at least \fInumChars\fR characters
long. \fBTcl_UniCharNcmp\fR  compares the two strings character-by-character
according to the Unicode character ordering.  It returns an integer greater
than, equal to, or less than 0 if the first string is greater than, equal
to, or less than the second string respectively.  \fBTcl_UniCharNcasecmp\fR
is the Unicode case insensitive version.
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharCaseMatch\fR is the Unicode equivalent to
\fBTcl_StringCaseMatch\fR.  It accepts a null-terminated Unicode string,
a Unicode pattern, and a boolean value specifying whether the match should
be case sensitive and returns whether the string matches the pattern.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfNcmp\fR corresponds to \fBstrncmp\fR for UTF-8 strings. It
accepts two null-terminated UTF-8 strings and the number of characters
to compare.  (Both strings are assumed to be at least \fInumChars\fR
characters long.)  \fBTcl_UtfNcmp\fR compares the two strings
character-by-character according to the Unicode character ordering.
It returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0 if the
first string is greater than, equal to, or less than the second string
respectively.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfNcasecmp\fR corresponds to \fBstrncasecmp\fR for UTF-8
strings.  It is similar to \fBTcl_UtfNcmp\fR except comparisons ignore
differences in case when comparing upper, lower or title case
characters.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfCharComplete\fR returns 1 if the source UTF-8 string \fIsrc\fR
of \fIlength\fR bytes is long enough to be decoded by
\fBTcl_UtfToUniChar\fR, or 0 otherwise.  This function does not guarantee
that the UTF-8 string is properly formed.  This routine is used by
procedures that are operating on a byte at a time and need to know if a
full Tcl_UniChar has been seen.
.PP
\fBTcl_NumUtfChars\fR corresponds to \fBstrlen\fR for UTF-8 strings.  It
returns the number of Tcl_UniChars that are represented by the UTF-8 string
\fIsrc\fR.  The length of the source string is \fIlength\fR bytes.  If the
length is negative, all bytes up to the first null byte are used.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfFindFirst\fR corresponds to \fBstrchr\fR for UTF-8 strings.  It
returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the Tcl_UniChar \fIch\fR
in the null-terminated UTF-8 string \fIsrc\fR.  The null terminator is
considered part of the UTF-8 string.  
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfFindLast\fR corresponds to \fBstrrchr\fR for UTF-8 strings.  It
returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the Tcl_UniChar \fIch\fR
in the null-terminated UTF-8 string \fIsrc\fR.  The null terminator is
considered part of the UTF-8 string.  
.PP
Given \fIsrc\fR, a pointer to some location in a UTF-8 string,
\fBTcl_UtfNext\fR returns a pointer to the next UTF-8 character in the
string.  The caller must not ask for the next character after the last
character in the string if the string is not terminated by a null
character.
.PP
Given \fIsrc\fR, a pointer to some location in a UTF-8 string (or to a
null byte immediately following such a string), \fBTcl_UtfPrev\fR
returns a pointer to the closest preceding byte that starts a UTF-8
character.
This function will not back up to a position before \fIstart\fR,
the start of the UTF-8 string.  If \fIsrc\fR was already at \fIstart\fR, the
return value will be \fIstart\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_UniCharAtIndex\fR corresponds to a C string array dereference or the
Pascal Ord() function.  It returns the Tcl_UniChar represented at the
specified character (not byte) \fIindex\fR in the UTF-8 string
\fIsrc\fR.  The source string must contain at least \fIindex\fR
characters.  Behavior is undefined if a negative \fIindex\fR is given.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfAtIndex\fR returns a pointer to the specified character (not
byte) \fIindex\fR in the UTF-8 string \fIsrc\fR.  The source string must
contain at least \fIindex\fR characters.  This is equivalent to calling 
\fBTcl_UtfNext\fR \fIindex\fR times.  If a negative \fIindex\fR is given,
the return pointer points to the first character in the source string.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfBackslash\fR is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl
commands.  It parses a backslash sequence and stores the properly formed
UTF-8 character represented by the backslash sequence in the output
buffer \fIdst\fR.  At most \fBTCL_UTF_MAX\fR bytes are stored in the buffer.
\fBTcl_UtfBackslash\fR modifies \fI*readPtr\fR to contain the number
of bytes in the backslash sequence, including the backslash character.
The return value is the number of bytes stored in the output buffer.
.PP
See the \fBTcl\fR manual entry for information on the valid backslash
sequences.  All of the sequences described in the Tcl manual entry are
supported by \fBTcl_UtfBackslash\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are used to create, modify, read, and delete
Tcl variables from C code.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetVar2Ex\fR, \fBTcl_SetVar\fR, \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR, and
\fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR 
will create a new variable or modify an existing one.
These procedures set the given variable to the value
given by \fInewValuePtr\fR or \fInewValue\fR and return a
pointer to the variable's new value, which is stored in Tcl's
variable structure.
\fBTcl_SetVar2Ex\fR and \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR take the new value as a
Tcl_Obj and return
a pointer to a Tcl_Obj.  \fBTcl_SetVar\fR and \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR
take the new value as a string and return a string; they are
usually less efficient than \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR.  Note that the
return value may be different than the \fInewValuePtr\fR or
\fInewValue\fR argument, due to modifications made by write traces.
If an error occurs in setting the variable (e.g. an array
variable is referenced without giving an index into the array)
NULL is returned and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR bit is set.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR, and
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR
return the current value of a variable.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to the procedures described above.
Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer
to the variable's value.  For \fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR and
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR the value is
returned as a pointer to a Tcl_Obj.  For \fBTcl_GetVar\fR and
\fBTcl_GetVar2\fR the value is returned as a string; this is
usually less efficient, so \fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR or \fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR
are preferred.
If an error occurs while reading the variable (e.g. the variable
does not exist or an array element is specified for a scalar
variable), then NULL is returned and an error message is left
in \fIinterp\fR's result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR
bit is set.
.PP
\fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR and \fBTcl_UnsetVar2\fR may be used to remove
a variable, so that future attempts to read the variable will return
an error.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to the procedures above.
If the variable is successfully removed then \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned.
If the variable cannot be removed because it does not exist then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and an error message is left
in \fIinterp\fR's result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR
bit is set.
If an array element is specified, the given element is removed
but the array remains.
If an array name is specified without an index, then the entire
array is removed.
.PP
The name of a variable may be specified to these procedures in
four ways:
.IP [1]
If \fBTcl_SetVar\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar\fR, or \fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR
is invoked, the variable name is given as
a single string, \fIvarName\fR.
If \fIvarName\fR contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis, then the value between the parentheses is
treated as an index (which can have any string value) and
the characters before the first open
parenthesis are treated as the name of an array variable.
If \fIvarName\fR does not have parentheses as described above, then
the entire string is treated as the name of a scalar variable.
.IP [2]
If the \fIname1\fR and \fIname2\fR arguments are provided and
\fIname2\fR is non-NULL, then an array element is specified and
the array name and index have
already been separated by the caller: \fIname1\fR contains the
name and \fIname2\fR contains the index.  An error is generated
if \fIname1\fR  contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis (array element) and \fIname2\fR is non-NULL.
.IP [3]
If \fIname2\fR is NULL, \fIname1\fR is treated just like
\fIvarName\fR in case [1] above (it can be either a scalar or an array
element variable name).
.PP
The \fIflags\fR argument may be used to specify any of several
options to the procedures.
It consists of an OR-ed combination of the following bits.
.TP
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR
Under normal circumstances the procedures look up variables as follows.
If a procedure call is active in \fIinterp\fR,
the variable is looked up at the current level of procedure call.
Otherwise, the variable is looked up first in the current namespace,
then in the global namespace.
However, if this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the global namespace
even if there is a procedure call active.
If both \fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR and \fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR are given,
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR is ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR
If this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the current namespace; if a procedure is active
its variables are ignored, and the global namespace is also ignored unless
it is the current namespace.
.TP
\fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR
If an error is returned and this bit is set in \fIflags\fR, then
an error message will be left in the interpreter's result,
where it can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR
or \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR.
If this flag bit is not set then no error message is left
and the interpreter's result will not be modified.
.TP
\fBTCL_APPEND_VALUE\fR
If this bit is set then \fInewValuePtr\fR or \fInewValue\fR is
appended to the current value instead of replacing it.
If the variable is currently undefined, then the bit is ignored.
This bit is only used by the \fBTcl_Set*\fR procedures.
.TP
\fBTCL_LIST_ELEMENT\fR
If this bit is set, then \fInewValue\fR is converted to a valid
Tcl list element before setting (or appending to) the variable.
A separator space is appended before the new list element unless
the list element is going to be the first element in a list or
sublist (i.e. the variable's current value is empty, or contains
the single character
.QW { ,
or ends in
.QW " }" ).
When appending, the original value of the variable must also be
a valid list, so that the operation is the appending of a new
list element onto a list.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR
return the current value of a variable.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to \fBTcl_SetVar\fR and \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR.
Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer
to the variable's value (which is stored in Tcl's variable
structure and will not change before the next call to \fBTcl_SetVar\fR
or \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR).
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR use the flag bits \fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR
and \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR, both of
which have
the same meaning as for \fBTcl_SetVar\fR.
If an error occurs in reading the variable (e.g. the variable
does not exist or an array element is specified for a scalar
variable), then NULL is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR and \fBTcl_UnsetVar2\fR may be used to remove
a variable, so that future calls to \fBTcl_GetVar\fR or \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR
for the variable will return an error.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to \fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR.
If the variable is successfully removed then \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned.
If the variable cannot be removed because it does not exist then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned.
If an array element is specified, the given element is removed
but the array remains.
If an array name is specified without an index, then the entire
array is removed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry allow Tcl objects to
be manipulated as string values.  They use the internal representation
of the object to store additional information to make the string
manipulations more efficient.  In particular, they make a series of
append operations efficient by allocating extra storage space for the
string so that it does not have to be copied for each append.
Also, indexing and length computations are optimized because the
Unicode string representation is calculated and cached as needed.
When using the \fBTcl_Append*\fR family of functions where the
interpreter's result is the object being appended to, it is important
to call Tcl_ResetResult first to ensure you are not unintentionally
appending to existing data in the result object.
.PP
\fBTcl_NewStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetStringObj\fR create a new object
or modify an existing object to hold a copy of the string given by
\fIbytes\fR and \fIlength\fR.  \fBTcl_NewUnicodeObj\fR and
\fBTcl_SetUnicodeObj\fR create a new object or modify an existing
object to hold a copy of the Unicode string given by \fIunicode\fR and
\fInumChars\fR.  \fBTcl_NewStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_NewUnicodeObj\fR
return a pointer to a newly created object with reference count zero.
All four procedures set the object to hold a copy of the specified
string.  \fBTcl_SetStringObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetUnicodeObj\fR free any
old string representation as well as any old internal representation
of the object.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetString\fR return an object's
string representation.  This is given by the returned byte pointer and
(for \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR) length, which is stored in
\fIlengthPtr\fR if it is non-NULL.  If the object's UTF string
representation is invalid (its byte pointer is NULL), the string
representation is regenerated from the object's internal
representation.  The storage referenced by the returned byte pointer
is owned by the object manager.  It is passed back as a writable
pointer so that extension author creating their own \fBTcl_ObjType\fR
will be able to modify the string representation within the
\fBTcl_UpdateStringProc\fR of their \fBTcl_ObjType\fR.  Except for that
limited purpose, the pointer returned by \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR
or \fBTcl_GetString\fR should be treated as read-only.  It is
recommended that this pointer be assigned to a (const char *) variable.
Even in the limited situations where writing to this pointer is
acceptable, one should take care to respect the copy-on-write
semantics required by \fBTcl_Obj\fR's, with appropriate calls
to \fBTcl_IsShared\fR and \fBTcl_DuplicateObj\fR prior to any
in-place modification of the string representation.
The procedure \fBTcl_GetString\fR is used in the common case
where the caller does not need the length of the string
representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetUnicodeFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetUnicode\fR return an object's
value as a Unicode string.  This is given by the returned pointer and
(for \fBTcl_GetUnicodeFromObj\fR) length, which is stored in
\fIlengthPtr\fR if it is non-NULL.  The storage referenced by the returned
byte pointer is owned by the object manager and should not be modified by
the caller.  The procedure \fBTcl_GetUnicode\fR is used in the common case
where the caller does not need the length of the unicode string
representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetUniChar\fR returns the \fIindex\fR'th character in the
object's Unicode representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRange\fR returns a newly created object comprised of the
characters between \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR (inclusive) in the
object's Unicode representation.  If the object's Unicode
representation is invalid, the Unicode representation is regenerated
from the object's string representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetCharLength\fR returns the number of characters (as opposed
to bytes) in the string object.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR appends the data given by \fIbytes\fR and
\fIlength\fR to the string representation of the object specified by
\fIobjPtr\fR.  If the object has an invalid string representation,
then an attempt is made to convert \fIbytes\fR is to the Unicode
format.  If the conversion is successful, then the converted form of
\fIbytes\fR is appended to the object's Unicode representation.
Otherwise, the object's Unicode representation is invalidated and
converted to the UTF format, and \fIbytes\fR is appended to the
object's new string representation.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendUnicodeToObj\fR appends the Unicode string given by
\fIunicode\fR and \fInumChars\fR to the object specified by
\fIobjPtr\fR.  If the object has an invalid Unicode representation,
then \fIunicode\fR is converted to the UTF format and appended to the
object's string representation.  Appends are optimized to handle
repeated appends relatively efficiently (it overallocates the string
or Unicode space to avoid repeated reallocations and copies of
object's string value).
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendObjToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR, but it
appends the string or Unicode value (whichever exists and is best
suited to be appended to \fIobjPtr\fR) of \fIappendObjPtr\fR to
\fIobjPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendStringsToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR
except that it can be passed more than one value to append and
each value must be a null-terminated string (i.e. none of the
values may contain internal null characters).  Any number of
\fIstring\fR arguments may be provided, but the last argument
must be a NULL pointer to indicate the end of the list.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendStringsToObjVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_AppendStringsToObj\fR
except that instead of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an
argument list.
.PP

\fBTcl_AppendLimitedToObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendToObj\fR
except that it imposes a limit on how many bytes are appended.
This can be handy when the string to be appended might be
very large, but the value being constructed should not be allowed to grow
without bound. A common usage is when constructing an error message, where the
end result should be kept short enough to be read.
Bytes from \fIbytes\fR are appended to \fIobjPtr\fR, but no more
than \fIlimit\fR bytes total are to be appended. If the limit prevents
all \fIlength\fR bytes that are available from being appended, then the
appending is done so that the last bytes appended are from the
string \fIellipsis\fR. This allows for an indication of the truncation
to be left in the string.
When \fIlength\fR is \fB-1\fR, all bytes up to the first zero byte are appended,
subject to the limit. When \fIellipsis\fR is NULL, the default
string \fB...\fR is used. When \fIellipsis\fR is non-NULL, it must point
to a zero-byte-terminated string in Tcl's internal UTF encoding.
The number of bytes appended can be less than the lesser
of \fIlength\fR and \fIlimit\fR when appending fewer
bytes is necessary to append only whole multi-byte characters.
.PP
\fBTcl_Format\fR is the C-level interface to the engine of the \fBformat\fR
command.  The actual command procedure for \fBformat\fR is little more
than
.CS
Tcl_Format(interp, Tcl_GetString(objv[1]), objc-2, objv+2);
.CE
The \fIobjc\fR Tcl_Obj values in \fIobjv\fR are formatted into a string
according to the conversion specification in \fIformat\fR argument, following
the documentation for the \fBformat\fR command.  The resulting formatted
string is converted to a new Tcl_Obj with refcount of zero and returned.
If some error happens during production of the formatted string, NULL is
returned, and an error message is recorded in \fIinterp\fR, if \fIinterp\fR
is non-NULL.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendFormatToObj\fR is an appending alternative form
of \fBTcl_Format\fR with functionality equivalent to
.CS
Tcl_Obj *newPtr = Tcl_Format(interp, format, objc, objv);
if (newPtr == NULL) return TCL_ERROR;
Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, newPtr);
return TCL_OK;
.CE
but with greater convenience and efficiency when the appending
functionality is needed.
.PP
\fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR serves as a replacement for the common sequence
.CS
char buf[SOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH];
sprintf(buf, format, ...);
Tcl_NewStringObj(buf, -1);
.CE
but with greater convenience and no need to 
determine \fBSOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH\fR. The formatting is done with the same
core formatting engine used by \fBTcl_Format\fR.  This means the set of
supported conversion specifiers is that of the \fBformat\fR command and
not that of the \fBsprintf\fR routine where the two sets differ. When a
conversion specifier passed to \fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR includes a precision,
the value is taken as a number of bytes, as \fBsprintf\fR does, and not
as a number of characters, as \fBformat\fR does.  This is done on the
assumption that C code is more likely to know how many bytes it is
passing around than the number of encoded characters those bytes happen
to represent.  The variable number of arguments passed in should be of
the types that would be suitable for passing to \fBsprintf\fR.  Note in
this example usage, \fIx\fR is of type \fBlong\fR.
.CS
long x = 5;
Tcl_Obj *objPtr = Tcl_ObjPrintf("Value is %d", x);
.CE
If the value of \fIformat\fR contains internal inconsistencies or invalid
specifier formats, the formatted string result produced by
\fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR will be an error message describing the error.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendPrintfToObj\fR is an appending alternative form
of \fBTcl_ObjPrintf\fR with functionality equivalent to
.CS
Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, Tcl_ObjPrintf(format, ...));
.CE
but with greater convenience and efficiency when the appending
functionality is needed.
.VE 8.5
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR procedure changes the length of the
string value of its \fIobjPtr\fR argument.  If the \fInewLength\fR
argument is greater than the space allocated for the object's
string, then the string space is reallocated and the old value
is copied to the new space; the bytes between the old length of
the string and the new length may have arbitrary values.
If the \fInewLength\fR argument is less than the current length
of the object's string, with \fIobjPtr->length\fR is reduced without
reallocating the string space; the original allocated size for the
string is recorded in the object, so that the string length can be
enlarged in a subsequent call to \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR without
reallocating storage.  In all cases \fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR leaves
a null character at \fIobjPtr->bytes[newLength]\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR is identical in function to
\fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR except that if sufficient memory to satisfy the
request cannot be allocated, it does not cause the Tcl interpreter to
\fBpanic\fR.  Thus, if \fInewLength\fR is greater than the space
allocated for the object's string, and there is not enough memory
available to satisfy the request, \fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR will take
no action and return 0 to indicate failure.  If there is enough memory
to satisfy the request, \fBTcl_AttemptSetObjLength\fR behaves just like
\fBTcl_SetObjLength\fR and returns 1 to indicate success.
.PP
The \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR function returns a new string object whose
value is the space-separated concatenation of the string
representations of all of the objects in the \fIobjv\fR
array. \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR eliminates leading and trailing white space
as it copies the string representations of the \fIobjv\fR array to the
result. If an element of the \fIobjv\fR array consists of nothing but
white space, then that object is ignored entirely. This white-space
removal was added to make the output of the \fBconcat\fR command
cleaner-looking. \fBTcl_ConcatObj\fR returns a pointer to a
newly-created object whose ref count is zero.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are used to create, modify, read, and delete
Tcl variables from C code.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetVar2Ex\fR, \fBTcl_SetVar\fR, \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR, and
\fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR 
will create a new variable or modify an existing one.
These procedures set the given variable to the value
given by \fInewValuePtr\fR or \fInewValue\fR and return a
pointer to the variable's new value, which is stored in Tcl's
variable structure.
\fBTcl_SetVar2Ex\fR and \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR take the new value as a
Tcl_Obj and return
a pointer to a Tcl_Obj.  \fBTcl_SetVar\fR and \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR
take the new value as a string and return a string; they are
usually less efficient than \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR.  Note that the
return value may be different than the \fInewValuePtr\fR or
\fInewValue\fR argument, due to modifications made by write traces.
If an error occurs in setting the variable (e.g. an array
variable is referenced without giving an index into the array)
NULL is returned and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR bit is set.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR, and
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR
return the current value of a variable.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to the procedures described above.
Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer
to the variable's value.  For \fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR and
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR the value is
returned as a pointer to a Tcl_Obj.  For \fBTcl_GetVar\fR and
\fBTcl_GetVar2\fR the value is returned as a string; this is
usually less efficient, so \fBTcl_GetVar2Ex\fR or \fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR
are preferred.
If an error occurs while reading the variable (e.g. the variable
does not exist or an array element is specified for a scalar
variable), then NULL is returned and an error message is left
in \fIinterp\fR's result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR
bit is set.
.PP
\fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR and \fBTcl_UnsetVar2\fR may be used to remove
a variable, so that future attempts to read the variable will return
an error.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to the procedures above.
If the variable is successfully removed then \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned.
If the variable cannot be removed because it does not exist then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and an error message is left
in \fIinterp\fR's result if the \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR \fIflag\fR
bit is set.
If an array element is specified, the given element is removed
but the array remains.
If an array name is specified without an index, then the entire
array is removed.
.PP
The name of a variable may be specified to these procedures in
four ways:
.IP [1]
If \fBTcl_SetVar\fR, \fBTcl_GetVar\fR, or \fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR
is invoked, the variable name is given as
a single string, \fIvarName\fR.
If \fIvarName\fR contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis, then the value between the parentheses is
treated as an index (which can have any string value) and
the characters before the first open
parenthesis are treated as the name of an array variable.
If \fIvarName\fR does not have parentheses as described above, then
the entire string is treated as the name of a scalar variable.
.IP [2]
If the \fIname1\fR and \fIname2\fR arguments are provided and
\fIname2\fR is non-NULL, then an array element is specified and
the array name and index have
already been separated by the caller: \fIname1\fR contains the
name and \fIname2\fR contains the index.  An error is generated
if \fIname1\fR  contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis (array element) and \fIname2\fR is non-NULL.
.IP [3]
If \fIname2\fR is NULL, \fIname1\fR is treated just like
\fIvarName\fR in case [1] above (it can be either a scalar or an array
element variable name).
.PP
The \fIflags\fR argument may be used to specify any of several
options to the procedures.
It consists of an OR-ed combination of the following bits.
.TP
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR
Under normal circumstances the procedures look up variables as follows.
If a procedure call is active in \fIinterp\fR,
the variable is looked up at the current level of procedure call.
Otherwise, the variable is looked up first in the current namespace,
then in the global namespace.
However, if this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the global namespace
even if there is a procedure call active.
If both \fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR and \fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR are given,
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR is ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR
If this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the current namespace; if a procedure is active
its variables are ignored, and the global namespace is also ignored unless
it is the current namespace.
.TP
\fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR
If an error is returned and this bit is set in \fIflags\fR, then
an error message will be left in the interpreter's result,
where it can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR
or \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR.
If this flag bit is not set then no error message is left
and the interpreter's result will not be modified.
.TP
\fBTCL_APPEND_VALUE\fR
If this bit is set then \fInewValuePtr\fR or \fInewValue\fR is
appended to the current value instead of replacing it.
If the variable is currently undefined, then the bit is ignored.
This bit is only used by the \fBTcl_Set*\fR procedures.
.TP
\fBTCL_LIST_ELEMENT\fR
If this bit is set, then \fInewValue\fR is converted to a valid
Tcl list element before setting (or appending to) the variable.
A separator space is appended before the new list element unless
the list element is going to be the first element in a list or
sublist (i.e. the variable's current value is empty, or contains
the single character
.QW { ,
or ends in
.QW " }" ).
When appending, the original value of the variable must also be
a valid list, so that the operation is the appending of a new
list element onto a list.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR
return the current value of a variable.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to \fBTcl_SetVar\fR and \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR.
Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer
to the variable's value (which is stored in Tcl's variable
structure and will not change before the next call to \fBTcl_SetVar\fR
or \fBTcl_SetVar2\fR).
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR use the flag bits \fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR
and \fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR, both of
which have
the same meaning as for \fBTcl_SetVar\fR.
If an error occurs in reading the variable (e.g. the variable
does not exist or an array element is specified for a scalar
variable), then NULL is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_UnsetVar\fR and \fBTcl_UnsetVar2\fR may be used to remove
a variable, so that future calls to \fBTcl_GetVar\fR or \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR
for the variable will return an error.
The arguments to these procedures are treated in the same way
as the arguments to \fBTcl_GetVar\fR and \fBTcl_GetVar2\fR.
If the variable is successfully removed then \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned.
If the variable cannot be removed because it does not exist then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned.
If an array element is specified, the given element is removed
but the array remains.
If an array name is specified without an index, then the entire
array is removed.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_DString *channelName in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Used for error reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.
.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.  
.AP int permissions in
POSIX-style permission flags such as 0644.  If a new file is created, these
permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in
Operating system specific handle for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a
file descriptor, for Windows it is a HANDLE.

is \fBbinary\fR, this is equivalent to the number of bytes to read from the 
channel.
.AP int appendFlag in
If non-zero, data read from the channel will be appended to the object.
Otherwise, the data will replace the existing contents of the object.
.AP char *readBuf out
A buffer in which to store the bytes read from the channel.

The number of bytes to read from the channel.  The buffer \fIreadBuf\fR must
be large enough to hold this many bytes.
.AP Tcl_Obj *lineObjPtr in/out
A pointer to a Tcl object in which to store the line read from the
channel.  The line read will be appended to the current value of the
object. 
.AP Tcl_DString *lineRead in/out
A pointer to a Tcl dynamic string in which to store the line read from the
channel.  Must have been initialized by the caller.  The line read will be
appended to any data already in the dynamic string.

Flag indicating whether the input should be added to the end or
beginning of the channel buffer.
.AP Tcl_Obj *writeObjPtr in
A pointer to a Tcl Object whose contents will be output to the channel.
.AP "const char" *charBuf in
A buffer containing the characters to output to the channel.
.AP "const char" *byteBuf in
A buffer containing the bytes to output to the channel.
.AP int bytesToWrite in
The number of bytes to consume from \fIcharBuf\fR or \fIbyteBuf\fR and
output to the channel.
.AP Tcl_WideInt offset in
How far to move the access point in the channel at which the next input or
output operation will be applied, measured in bytes from the position
given by \fIseekMode\fR.  May be either positive or negative.
.AP int seekMode in
Relative to which point to seek; used with \fIoffset\fR to calculate the new
access point for the channel. Legal values are \fBSEEK_SET\fR,
\fBSEEK_CUR\fR, and \fBSEEK_END\fR.
.AP Tcl_WideInt length in
The (non-negative) length to truncate the channel the channel to.
.AP "const char" *optionName in
The name of an option applicable to this channel, such as \fB\-blocking\fR.
May have any of the values accepted by the \fBfconfigure\fR command.
.AP Tcl_DString *optionValue in
Where to store the value of an option or a list of all options and their
values. Must have been initialized by the caller.
.AP "const char" *newValue in
New value for the option given by \fIoptionName\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.

permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions are convenience procedures for creating
channels that communicate over TCP sockets.
The operations on a channel
are described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR opens a client TCP socket connected to a \fIport\fR
on a specific \fIhost\fR, and returns a channel that can be used to
communicate with the server. The host to connect to can be specified either
as a domain name style name (e.g. \fBwww.sunlabs.com\fR), or as a string
containing the alphanumeric representation of its four-byte address (e.g.
\fB127.0.0.1\fR). Use the string \fBlocalhost\fR to connect to a TCP socket on
the host on which the function is invoked.
.PP
The \fImyaddr\fR and \fImyport\fR arguments allow a client to specify an
address for the local end of the connection.  If \fImyaddr\fR is NULL, then
an interface is chosen automatically by the operating system.
If \fImyport\fR is 0, then a port number is chosen at random by
the operating system.
.PP
If \fIasync\fR is zero, the call to \fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns only
after the client socket has either successfully connected to the server, or
the attempted connection has failed.
If \fIasync\fR is nonzero the socket is connected asynchronously and the
returned channel may not yet be connected to the server when the call to
\fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns. If the channel is in blocking mode and an
input or output operation is done on the channel before the connection is
completed or fails, that operation will wait until the connection either
completes successfully or fails. If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the
input or output operation will return immediately and a subsequent call to
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR on the channel will return nonzero.
.PP
The returned channel is opened for reading and writing.
If an error occurs in opening the socket, \fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns
NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved
with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, an error message
is left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeTcpClientChannel\fR creates a \fBTcl_Channel\fR around an
existing, platform specific, handle for a client TCP socket.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENTCPSERVER
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR opens a TCP socket on the local host on a specified
\fIport\fR and uses the Tcl event mechanism to accept requests from clients
to connect to it. The \fImyaddr\fR argument specifies the network interface.
If \fImyaddr\fR is NULL the special address INADDR_ANY should be used to
allow connections from any network interface.
Each time a client connects to this socket, Tcl creates a channel
for the new connection and invokes \fIproc\fR with information about
the channel. \fIProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_TcpAcceptProc(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
        Tcl_Channel \fIchannel\fR,
        char *\fIhostName\fR,
        int \fIport\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIclientData\fR argument will be the same as the \fIclientData\fR
argument to \fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR, \fIchannel\fR will be the handle
for the new channel, \fIhostName\fR points to a string containing
the name of the client host making the connection, and \fIport\fR
will contain the client's port number.

TCP server channels operate correctly only in applications that dispatch
events through \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR or through Tcl commands such as
\fBvwait\fR; otherwise Tcl will never notice that a connection request from
a remote client is pending.

The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions are convenience procedures for creating
channels that communicate over TCP sockets.
The operations on a channel
are described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR opens a client TCP socket connected to a \fIport\fR
on a specific \fIhost\fR, and returns a channel that can be used to
communicate with the server. The host to connect to can be specified either
as a domain name style name (e.g. \fBwww.sunlabs.com\fR), or as a string
containing the alphanumeric representation of its four-byte address (e.g.
\fB127.0.0.1\fR). Use the string \fBlocalhost\fR to connect to a TCP socket on
the host on which the function is invoked.
.PP
The \fImyaddr\fR and \fImyport\fR arguments allow a client to specify an
address for the local end of the connection.  If \fImyaddr\fR is NULL, then
an interface is chosen automatically by the operating system.
If \fImyport\fR is 0, then a port number is chosen at random by
the operating system.
.PP
If \fIasync\fR is zero, the call to \fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns only
after the client socket has either successfully connected to the server, or
the attempted connection has failed.
If \fIasync\fR is nonzero the socket is connected asynchronously and the
returned channel may not yet be connected to the server when the call to
\fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns. If the channel is in blocking mode and an
input or output operation is done on the channel before the connection is
completed or fails, that operation will wait until the connection either
completes successfully or fails. If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the
input or output operation will return immediately and a subsequent call to
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR on the channel will return nonzero.
.PP
The returned channel is opened for reading and writing.
If an error occurs in opening the socket, \fBTcl_OpenTcpClient\fR returns
NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved
with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, an error message
is left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeTcpClientChannel\fR creates a \fBTcl_Channel\fR around an
existing, platform specific, handle for a client TCP socket.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENTCPSERVER
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR opens a TCP socket on the local host on a specified
\fIport\fR and uses the Tcl event mechanism to accept requests from clients
to connect to it. The \fImyaddr\fR argument specifies the network interface.
If \fImyaddr\fR is NULL the special address INADDR_ANY should be used to
allow connections from any network interface.
Each time a client connects to this socket, Tcl creates a channel
for the new connection and invokes \fIproc\fR with information about
the channel. \fIProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_TcpAcceptProc(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
        Tcl_Channel \fIchannel\fR,
        char *\fIhostName\fR,
        int \fIport\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIclientData\fR argument will be the same as the \fIclientData\fR
argument to \fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR, \fIchannel\fR will be the handle
for the new channel, \fIhostName\fR points to a string containing
the name of the client host making the connection, and \fIport\fR
will contain the client's port number.
The new channel
is opened for both input and output. 
If \fIproc\fR raises an error, the connection is closed automatically.
\fIProc\fR has no return value, but if it wishes to reject the
connection it can close \fIchannel\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR normally returns a pointer to a channel
representing the server socket.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR returns NULL and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if the interpreter is non-NULL, an error message
is left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
The channel returned by \fBTcl_OpenTcpServer\fR cannot be used for
either input or output.
It is simply a handle for the socket used to accept connections.
The caller can close the channel to shut down the server and disallow
further connections from new clients.
.PP
TCP server channels operate correctly only in applications that dispatch
events through \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR or through Tcl commands such as
\fBvwait\fR; otherwise Tcl will never notice that a connection request from
a remote client is pending.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
On Unix platforms, the socket handle is a Unix file descriptor as

socket handle is a \fBSOCKET\fR as defined in the WinSock API.

Used for error reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.
.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.  
.AP int permissions in
POSIX-style permission flags such as 0644.  If a new file is created, these
permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in
Operating system specific handle for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a
file descriptor, for Windows it is a HANDLE.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When the Tcl library detects that its internal data structures are in an
inconsistent state, or that its C procedures have been called in a
manner inconsistent with their documentation, it calls \fBTcl_Panic\fR
to display a message describing the error and abort the process.  The
\fIformat\fR argument is a format string describing how to format the
remaining arguments \fIarg\fR into an error message, according to the
same formatting rules used by the \fBprintf\fR family of functions.  The
same formatting rules are also used by the built-in Tcl command
\fBformat\fR.
.PP
In a freshly loaded Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR prints the formatted
error message to the standard error file of the process, and then
calls \fBabort\fR to terminate the process.  \fBTcl_Panic\fR does not
return.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR may be used to modify the behavior of
\fBTcl_Panic\fR.  The \fIpanicProc\fR argument should match the
type \fBTcl_PanicProc\fR:
.PP
.CS
typedef void Tcl_PanicProc(
        const char *\fBformat\fR,
        \fBarg\fR, \fBarg\fR,...);
.CE
.PP
After \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR returns, any future calls to
\fBTcl_Panic\fR will call \fIpanicProc\fR, passing along the
\fIformat\fR and \fIarg\fR arguments.  To maintain consistency with the
callers of \fBTcl_Panic\fR, \fIpanicProc\fR must not return; it must
call \fBabort\fR.  \fIpanicProc\fR should avoid making calls into the
Tcl library, or into other libraries that may call the Tcl library,
since the original call to \fBTcl_Panic\fR indicates the Tcl library is
not in a state of reliable operation.  
.PP
The typical use of \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR arranges for the error message
to be displayed or reported in a manner more suitable for the
application or the platform.  As an example, the Windows implementation
of \fBwish\fR calls \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR to force all panic messages
to be displayed in a system dialog box, rather than to be printed to the

Although the primary callers of \fBTcl_Panic\fR are the procedures of
the Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR is a public function and may be called
by any extension or application that wishes to abort the process and
have a panic message displayed the same way that panic messages from Tcl
will be displayed.
.PP
\fBTcl_PanicVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Panic\fR except that instead of
taking a variable number of arguments it takes an argument list.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When the Tcl library detects that its internal data structures are in an
inconsistent state, or that its C procedures have been called in a
manner inconsistent with their documentation, it calls \fBTcl_Panic\fR
to display a message describing the error and abort the process.  The
\fIformat\fR argument is a format string describing how to format the
remaining arguments \fIarg\fR into an error message, according to the
same formatting rules used by the \fBprintf\fR family of functions.  The
same formatting rules are also used by the built-in Tcl command
\fBformat\fR.
.PP
In a freshly loaded Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR prints the formatted
error message to the standard error file of the process, and then
calls \fBabort\fR to terminate the process.  \fBTcl_Panic\fR does not
return.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR may be used to modify the behavior of
\fBTcl_Panic\fR.  The \fIpanicProc\fR argument should match the
type \fBTcl_PanicProc\fR:
.PP
.CS
typedef void Tcl_PanicProc(
        const char *\fBformat\fR,
        \fBarg\fR, \fBarg\fR,...);
.CE
.PP
After \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR returns, any future calls to
\fBTcl_Panic\fR will call \fIpanicProc\fR, passing along the
\fIformat\fR and \fIarg\fR arguments.  To maintain consistency with the
callers of \fBTcl_Panic\fR, \fIpanicProc\fR must not return; it must
call \fBabort\fR.  \fIpanicProc\fR should avoid making calls into the
Tcl library, or into other libraries that may call the Tcl library,
since the original call to \fBTcl_Panic\fR indicates the Tcl library is
not in a state of reliable operation.  
.PP
The typical use of \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR arranges for the error message
to be displayed or reported in a manner more suitable for the
application or the platform.  As an example, the Windows implementation
of \fBwish\fR calls \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR to force all panic messages
to be displayed in a system dialog box, rather than to be printed to the
standard error file (usually not visible under Windows).
.PP
Although the primary callers of \fBTcl_Panic\fR are the procedures of
the Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR is a public function and may be called
by any extension or application that wishes to abort the process and
have a panic message displayed the same way that panic messages from Tcl
will be displayed.
.PP
\fBTcl_PanicVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Panic\fR except that instead of
taking a variable number of arguments it takes an argument list.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *usedParsePtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.SH "TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE"
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
return parse information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *\fIcommentStart\fR;
        int \fIcommentSize\fR;
        const char *\fIcommandStart\fR;
        int \fIcommandSize\fR;
        int \fInumWords\fR;
        Tcl_Token *\fItokenPtr\fR;
        int \fInumTokens\fR;
        ...
} Tcl_Parse;

typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int \fItype\fR;
        const char *\fIstart\fR;
        int \fIsize\fR;
        int \fInumComponents\fR;
} Tcl_Token;
.CE
.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.SH "TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE"
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
return parse information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *\fIcommentStart\fR;
        int \fIcommentSize\fR;
        const char *\fIcommandStart\fR;
        int \fIcommandSize\fR;
        int \fInumWords\fR;
        Tcl_Token *\fItokenPtr\fR;
        int \fInumTokens\fR;
        ...
} Tcl_Parse;

typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int \fItype\fR;
        const char *\fIstart\fR;
        int \fIsize\fR;
        int \fInumComponents\fR;
} Tcl_Token;
.CE
.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.AS Tcl_Interp *usedParsePtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.AS Tcl_Interp *usedParsePtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.SH "TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE"
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
return parse information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *\fIcommentStart\fR;
        int \fIcommentSize\fR;
        const char *\fIcommandStart\fR;
        int \fIcommandSize\fR;
        int \fInumWords\fR;
        Tcl_Token *\fItokenPtr\fR;

        ...
} Tcl_Parse;

typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int \fItype\fR;
        const char *\fIstart\fR;
        int \fIsize\fR;
        int \fInumComponents\fR;
} Tcl_Token;
.CE
.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.AS Tcl_Interp *usedParsePtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.SH "TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE"
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
return parse information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *\fIcommentStart\fR;
        int \fIcommentSize\fR;
        const char *\fIcommandStart\fR;
        int \fIcommandSize\fR;
        int \fInumWords\fR;
        Tcl_Token *\fItokenPtr\fR;
        int \fInumTokens\fR;
        ...
} Tcl_Parse;

typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int \fItype\fR;
        const char *\fIstart\fR;
        int \fIsize\fR;
        int \fInumComponents\fR;
} Tcl_Token;
.CE
.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.AS Tcl_Interp *usedParsePtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp out
For procedures other than \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR, \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR
and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR, used only for error reporting;
if NULL, then no error messages are left after errors.
For \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR and \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR,
determines the context for evaluating the
script and also is used for error reporting; must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *start in
Pointer to first character in string to parse.
.AP int numBytes in
Number of bytes in string to parse, not including any terminating null
character.  If less than 0 then the script consists of all characters
following \fIstart\fR up to the first null character.
.AP int nested in
Non-zero means that the script is part of a command substitution so an
unquoted close bracket should be treated as a command terminator.  If zero,
close brackets have no special meaning. 
.AP int append in
Non-zero means that \fI*parsePtr\fR already contains valid tokens; the new
tokens should be appended to those already present.  Zero means that
\fI*parsePtr\fR is uninitialized; any information in it is ignored.
This argument is normally 0.
.AP Tcl_Parse *parsePtr out
Points to structure to fill in with information about the parsed
command, expression, variable name, etc.
Any previous information in this structure
is ignored, unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero in a call to
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR,
or \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.AP "const char" **termPtr out
If not NULL, points to a location where
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR, \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR will store a pointer to the character
just after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
character of the variable name, or the close-quote (respectively))
if the parse was successful.
.AP Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr in
Points to structure that was filled in by a previous call to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
expressions or references to variables.
Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or portion thereof)
and fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with a collection of tokens describing the information that was parsed.
The procedures normally return \fBTCL_OK\fR.
However, if an error occurs then they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
leave an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
(if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL),
and leave nothing in \fIparsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR is a procedure that parses Tcl
scripts.  Given a pointer to a script, it
parses the first command from the script.  If the command was parsed
successfully, \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the command (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses Tcl expressions.
Given a pointer to a script containing an expression,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR parses the expression.
If the expression was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the
structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR with information about the
structure of the expression (see below for details).
If an error occurred in parsing the command then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result, and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as
\fB{hello}\fR or \fB{string \et with \et tabs}\fR
from the beginning of its argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB{\fR. 
If the braced string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB}\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR parses a double-quoted string such as
\fB"sum is [expr {$a+$b}]"\fR
from the beginning of the argument \fIstart\fR.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB\N'34'\fR. 
If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR,
fills in the structure pointed to by \fIparsePtr\fR
with information about the structure of the string
(see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the terminating \fB\N'34'\fR
in the location given by \fI*termPtr\fR.
If an error occurs while parsing the string
then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result,
and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR or \fI*termPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR parses a Tcl variable reference such as
\fB$abc\fR or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its
\fIstart\fR argument.
The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR. 
If a variable name was parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
returns \fBTCL_OK\fR and fills in the structure pointed to by
\fIparsePtr\fR with information about the structure of the variable name
(see below for details).  If an error
occurs while parsing the command then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an
error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result (if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL), and no information is left at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseVar\fR parse a Tcl variable reference such as \fB$abc\fR
or \fB$x([expr {$index + 1}])\fR from the beginning of its \fIstart\fR
argument.  The first character of \fIstart\fR must be \fB$\fR.  If
the variable name is parsed successfully, \fBTcl_ParseVar\fR returns a
pointer to the string value of the variable.  If an error occurs while
parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
The information left at \fI*parsePtr\fR
by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return \fBTCL_OK\fR
then the caller must invoke \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR to release
the storage at \fI*parsePtr\fR.
These procedures ignore any existing information in
\fI*parsePtr\fR (unless \fIappend\fR is non-zero),
so if repeated calls are being made to any of them
then \fBTcl_FreeParse\fR must be invoked once after each call.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR evaluates a sequence of parse tokens from
a Tcl_Parse structure.  The tokens typically consist
of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for
a reference to an array variable.  \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR performs the
substitutions requested by the tokens and concatenates the
resulting values. 
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
\fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, or possibly
some other integer value originating in an extension.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR differs from \fBTcl_EvalTokensStandard\fR only in
the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
The reference count of the object returned as result has been
incremented, so the caller must
invoke \fBTcl_DecrRefCount\fR when it is finished with the object.
If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return value
is NULL and an error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result. The use
of \fBTcl_EvalTokens\fR is deprecated.

.SH "TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE"
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR
return parse information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *\fIcommentStart\fR;
        int \fIcommentSize\fR;
        const char *\fIcommandStart\fR;
        int \fIcommandSize\fR;
        int \fInumWords\fR;
        Tcl_Token *\fItokenPtr\fR;
        int \fInumTokens\fR;
        ...
} Tcl_Parse;

typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int \fItype\fR;
        const char *\fIstart\fR;
        int \fIsize\fR;
        int \fInumComponents\fR;
} Tcl_Token;
.CE
.PP
The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure
are filled in only by \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR.
These fields are not used by the other parsing procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR fills in a Tcl_Parse structure
with information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that
precede the command.
If there are comments,
the \fIcommentStart\fR field points to the \fB#\fR character that begins
the first comment and \fIcommentSize\fR indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the newline
character that terminates the last comment.
If the command is not preceded by any comments, \fIcommentSize\fR is 0.
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR also sets the \fIcommandStart\fR field
to point to the first character of the first
word in the command (skipping any comments and leading space) and 
\fIcommandSize\fR gives the total number of bytes in the command,
including the character pointed to by \fIcommandStart\fR up to and
including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command.  The \fInumWords\fR field gives the
total number of words in the command.
.PP
All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
\fItokenPtr\fR and \fInumTokens\fR.
The \fItokenPtr\fR field points to the first in an array of Tcl_Token
structures that describe the components of the entity being parsed.
The \fInumTokens\fR field gives the total number of tokens
present in the array.
Each token contains four fields.
The \fItype\fR field selects one of several token types
that are described below.  The \fIstart\fR field
points to the first character in the token and the \fIsize\fR field
gives the total number of characters in the token.  Some token types,
such as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, consist of
several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent token;
the \fInumComponents\fR field describes how many of these there are.
The \fItype\fR field has one of the following values:
.TP 20
\fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR
This token ordinarily describes one word of a command
but it may also describe a quoted or braced string in an expression.
The token describes a component of the script that is
the result of concatenating together a sequence of subcomponents,
each described by a separate subtoken.
The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or open brace)
and includes all characters in the component up to but not including the
space, semicolon, close bracket, close quote, or close brace that
terminates the component.  The \fInumComponents\fR field counts the total
number of sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR and \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the word is guaranteed to consist of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
sub-token.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 1.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR
.VS 8.5
This token has the same meaning as \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, except that
the command parser notes this word began with the expansion
prefix \fB{*}\fR, indicating that after substitution,
the list value of this word should be expanded to form multiple
arguments in command evaluation.  This
token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR
The token describes a backslash sequence such as \fB\en\fR or \fB\e0xa3\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR
The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into
the word.  The token includes the square brackets that surround the
command.  The \fInumComponents\fR field is always 0 (the nested command
is not parsed; call \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR recursively if you want to
see its tokens).
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR
The token describes a variable substitution, including the
\fB$\fR, variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the
close parenthesis that terminates the index.  This token is followed
by one or more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index.  If \fInumComponents\fR  is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token that gives the
variable name.  If \fInumComponents\fR is greater than 1 then the
variable is an array: the first sub-token is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR
token giving the array name and the remaining sub-tokens are
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
array index. The \fInumComponents\fR field includes nested sub-tokens
that are part of \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR tokens in the array index.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR
The token describes one subexpression of an expression
(or an entire expression).
A subexpression may consist of a value
such as an integer literal, variable substitution,
or parenthesized subexpression;
it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non-blank character of the subexpression
up to but not including the space, brace, close-paren, or bracket
that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens
that describe the subexpression.
If the first sub-token after the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
is a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token,
the subexpression consists of an operator and its token operands.
If the operator has no operands, the subexpression consists of
just the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token.
Each operand is described by a \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token.
Otherwise, the subexpression is a value described by
one of the token types \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, 
\fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field
counts the total number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression;
this includes the sub-tokens for any nested \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens.
.TP
\fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR
The token describes one operator of an expression
such as \fB&&\fR or \fBhypot\fR.
A \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token is always preceded by a
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
that describes the operator and its operands;
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token's \fInumComponents\fR field
can be used to determine the number of operands.
A binary operator such as \fB*\fR
is followed by two \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens
that describe its operands.
A unary operator like \fB\-\fR
is followed by a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR token
for its operand.
If the operator is a math function such as \fBlog10\fR,
the \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token will give its name and
the following \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens will describe
its operands;
if there are no operands (as with \fBrand\fR),
no \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens follow.
There is one trinary operator, \fB?\fR,
that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as \fIx\fB?\fIy\fB:\fIz\fR;
in this case, the \fB?\fR \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is followed by three \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR tokens for the operands
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, and \fIz\fR.
The \fInumComponents\fR field for a \fBTCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR\fR token
is always 0.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or
.VS 8.5
\fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR.  
It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of that word.
The next token is the \fBTCL_TOKEN_WORD\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD\fR
of \fBTCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD\fR token for the second word,
followed by sub-tokens for that
word, and so on until all \fInumWords\fR have been accounted
for.
.VE 8.5
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR\fR.
It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be evaluated
to produce the value of the expression.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure will contain a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
if the braced string does not contain any backslash-newlines.
If the string does contain backslash-newlines,
the array of tokens will contain one or more
\fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR or \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR sub-tokens
that must be concatenated to produce the value of the string.
If the braced string was just \fB{}\fR
(that is, the string was empty),
the single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token will have a \fIsize\fR field
containing zero;
this ensures that at least one token appears
to describe the braced string.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified
by \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR returns,
the array of tokens pointed to by the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure depends on the contents of the quoted string.
It will consist of one or more \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR, \fBTCL_TOKEN_BS\fR,
\fBTCL_TOKEN_COMMAND\fR, and \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR sub-tokens.
The array always contains at least one token;
for example, if the argument \fIstart\fR is empty,
the array returned consists of a single \fBTCL_TOKEN_TEXT\fR token
with a zero \fIsize\fR field.
Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified: the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
After \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR returns, the first token pointed to by
the \fItokenPtr\fR field of the
Tcl_Parse structure always has type \fBTCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE\fR.  It
is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the variable name as
described above.  The total length of the variable name is
contained in the \fIsize\fR field of the first token.
As in \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR,
only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
is modified by \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR:
the \fIcommentStart\fR, \fIcommentSize\fR,
\fIcommandStart\fR, and \fIcommandSize\fR fields are not modified.
.PP
All of the character pointers in the
Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token structures refer
to characters in the \fIstart\fR argument passed to
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR.
.PP
There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
\fInumTokens\fR field, but these are for the private use of
\fBTcl_ParseCommand\fR, \fBTcl_ParseExpr\fR, \fBTcl_ParseBraces\fR,
\fBTcl_ParseQuotedString\fR, and \fBTcl_ParseVarName\fR; they should not be
referenced by code outside of these procedures.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

Interpreter where package is needed or available.
.AP "const char" *name in
Name of package.
.AP "const char" *version in
A version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers
separated by dots.
.AP int exact in
Non-zero means that only the particular version specified by
\fIversion\fR is acceptable.
Zero means that newer versions than \fIversion\fR are also
acceptable as long as they have the same major version number
as \fIversion\fR.
.AP ClientData clientData in
Arbitrary value to be associated with the package.
.AP ClientData *clientDataPtr out
Pointer to place to store the value associated with the matching
package. It is only changed if the pointer is not NULL and the
function completed successfully.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

.AS ClientData clientDataPtr out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter where package is needed or available.
.AP "const char" *name in
Name of package.
.AP "const char" *version in
A version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers
separated by dots.
.AP int exact in
Non-zero means that only the particular version specified by
\fIversion\fR is acceptable.
Zero means that newer versions than \fIversion\fR are also
acceptable as long as they have the same major version number
as \fIversion\fR.
.AP ClientData clientData in
Arbitrary value to be associated with the package.
.AP ClientData *clientDataPtr out
Pointer to place to store the value associated with the matching
package. It is only changed if the pointer is not NULL and the
function completed successfully.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage require\fR
command, \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR is equivalent to the \fBpackage present\fR
command, and \fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR is equivalent to the
\fBpackage provide\fR command.
.PP
See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.
.PP
If \fBTcl_PkgPresent\fR or \fBTcl_PkgRequire\fR complete successfully
they return a pointer to the version string for the version of the package
that is provided in the interpreter (which may be different than 
\fIversion\fR); if an error occurs they return NULL and leave an error 
message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvide\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it completes successfully;
if an error occurs it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message
in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgProvideEx\fR, \fBTcl_PkgPresentEx\fR and \fBTcl_PkgRequireEx\fR
allow the setting and retrieving of the client data associated with
the package. In all other respects they are equivalent to the matching
functions.
.PP
\fBTcl_PkgRequireProc\fR is the form of \fBpackage require\fR handling
multiple requirements. The other forms are present for backward
compatibility and translate their invocations to this form.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.5
The \fBTcl_SetReturnOptions\fR and \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR
routines expose the same capabilities as the \fBreturn\fR and
\fBcatch\fR commands, respectively, in the form of a C interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR retrieves the dictionary of return options
from an interpreter following a script evaluation.
Routines such as \fBTcl_Eval\fR are called to evaluate a
script in an interpreter.  These routines return an integer
completion code.  These routines also leave in the interpreter
both a result and a dictionary of return options generated
by script evaluation.  Just as \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR retrieves
the result, \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR retrieves the dictionary
of return options.  The integer completion code should be
passed as the \fIcode\fR argument to \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR
so that all required options will be present in the dictionary.
Specifically, a \fIcode\fR value of \fBTCL_ERROR\fR will
ensure that entries for the keys \fB\-errorinfo\fR,
\fB\-errorcode\fR, and \fB\-errorline\fR will appear in the
dictionary.  Also, the entries for the keys \fB\-code\fR
and \fB\-level\fR will be adjusted if necessary to agree
with the value of \fIcode\fR.  The \fB(Tcl_Obj *)\fR returned
by \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR points to an unshared
\fBTcl_Obj\fR with reference count of zero.  The dictionary
may be written to, either adding, removing, or overwriting
any entries in it, with the need to check for a shared object.
.PP
A typical usage for \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR is to
retrieve the stack trace when script evaluation returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR, like so:
.CS
int code = Tcl_Eval(interp, script);
if (code == TCL_ERROR) {
    Tcl_Obj *options = Tcl_GetReturnOptions(interp, code);  
    Tcl_Obj *key = Tcl_NewStringObj("-errorinfo", -1);
    Tcl_Obj *stackTrace;
    Tcl_IncrRefCount(key);
    Tcl_DictObjGet(NULL, options, key, &stackTrace);
    Tcl_DecrRefCount(key);
    /* Do something with stackTrace */
}
.CE
.PP
\fBTcl_SetReturnOptions\fR sets the return options
of \fIinterp\fR to be \fIoptions\fR.  If \fIoptions\fR
contains any invalid value for any key, TCL_ERROR will
be returned, and the interp result will be set to an
appropriate error message.  Otherwise, a completion code
in agreement with the \fB\-code\fR and \fB\-level\fR
keys in \fIoptions\fR will be returned.
.PP
As an example, Tcl's \fBreturn\fR command itself could
be implemented in terms of \fBTcl_SetReturnOptions\fR
like so:
.CS
if ((objc % 2) == 0) { /* explicit result argument */
    objc--;
    Tcl_SetObjResult(interp, objv[objc]);
}
return Tcl_SetReturnOptions(interp, Tcl_NewListObj(objc-1, objv+1));
.CE
(It is not really implemented that way.  Internal access
privileges allow for a more efficient alternative that meshes
better with the bytecode compiler.)
.PP
Note that a newly created \fBTcl_Obj\fR may be passed
in as the \fIoptions\fR argument without the need to tend
to any reference counting.  This is analogous to
\fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR.
.PP
While \fBTcl_SetReturnOptions\fR provides a general interface
to set any collection of return options, there are a handful
of return options that are very frequently used.  Most 
notably the \fB\-errorinfo\fR and \fB\-errorcode\fR return
options should be set properly when the command procedure
of a command returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.  Tcl provides several
simpler interfaces to more directly set these return options.
.VE 8.5
.PP
The \fB\-errorinfo\fR option holds a stack trace of the
operations that were in progress when an error occurred,
and is intended to be human-readable.
The \fB\-errorcode\fR option holds a list of items that
are intended to be machine-readable.
The first item in the \fB\-errorcode\fR value identifies the class of
error that occurred
(e.g. POSIX means an error occurred in a POSIX system call)
and additional elements hold additional pieces
of information that depend on the class.
See the tclvars manual entry for details on the various
formats for the \fB\-errorcode\fR option used by
Tcl's built-in commands.
.PP
The \fB\-errorinfo\fR option value is gradually built up as an
error unwinds through the nested operations.
Each time an error code is returned to \fBTcl_Eval\fR, or
any of the routines that performs script evaluation,
the procedure \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR is called to add
additional text to the \fB\-errorinfo\fR value describing the
command that was being executed when the error occurred.
By the time the error has been passed all the way back
to the application, it will contain a complete trace
of the activity in progress when the error occurred.
.PP
It is sometimes useful to add additional information to
the \fB\-errorinfo\fR value beyond what can be supplied automatically
by the script evaluation routines.
\fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR may be used for this purpose:
its \fImessage\fR argument is an additional
string to be appended to the \fB\-errorinfo\fR option.
For example, when an error arises during the \fBsource\fR command,
the procedure \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR is called to
record the name of the file being processed and the
line number on which the error occurred.
Likewise, when an error arises during evaluation of a
Tcl procedures, the procedure name and line number
within the procedure are recorded, and so on.
The best time to call \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR is just after
a script evaluation routine has returned \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.
The value of the \fB\-errorline\fR return option (retrieved
via a call to \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR) often makes up
a useful part of the \fImessage\fR passed to \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR.
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_AppendObjToErrorInfo\fR is an alternative interface to the
same functionality as \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR.  \fBTcl_AppendObjToErrorInfo\fR
is called when the string value to be appended to the \fB\-errorinfo\fR option
is available as a \fBTcl_Obj\fR instead of as a \fBchar\fR array.
.VE 8.5
.PP
\fBTcl_AddObjErrorInfo\fR is nearly identical
to \fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR, except that it has an additional \fIlength\fR
argument.  This allows the \fImessage\fR string to contain 
embedded null bytes.  This is essentially never a good idea.
If the \fImessage\fR needs to contain the null character \fBU+0000\fR,
Tcl's usual internal encoding rules should be used to avoid
the need for a null byte.  If the \fBTcl_AddObjErrorInfo\fR
interface is used at all, it should be with a negative \fIlength\fR value.
.PP
The procedure \fBTcl_SetObjErrorCode\fR is used to set the
\fB\-errorcode\fR return option to the list object \fIerrorObjPtr\fR 
built up by the caller. 
\fBTcl_SetObjErrorCode\fR is typically invoked just 
before returning an error. If an error is
returned without calling \fBTcl_SetObjErrorCode\fR or
\fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR the Tcl interpreter automatically sets
the \fB\-errorcode\fR return option to \fBNONE\fR.
.PP
The procedure \fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR is also used to set the
\fB\-errorcode\fR return option. However, it takes one or more strings to
record instead of an object. Otherwise, it is similar to
\fBTcl_SetObjErrorCode\fR in behavior.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetErrorCodeVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR except that
instead of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an argument list.
.PP
\fBTcl_PosixError\fR
sets the \fB\-errorcode\fR variable after an error in a POSIX kernel call.
It reads the value of the \fBerrno\fR C variable and calls
\fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR to set the \fB\-errorcode\fR return
option in the \fBPOSIX\fR format.
The caller must previously have called \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to set
\fBerrno\fR; this is necessary on some platforms (e.g. Windows) where Tcl
is linked into an application as a shared library, or when the error
occurs in a dynamically loaded extension. See the manual entry for
\fBTcl_SetErrno\fR for more information.
.PP
\fBTcl_PosixError\fR returns a human-readable diagnostic message
for the error
(this is the same value that will appear as the third element
in the \fB\-errorcode\fR value).
It may be convenient to include this string as part of the
error message returned to the application in
the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_LogCommandInfo\fR is invoked after an error occurs in an
interpreter.  It adds information about the command that was being
executed when the error occurred to the \fB\-errorinfo\fR value, and
the line number stored internally in the interpreter is set.  
.PP
In older releases of Tcl, there was no \fBTcl_GetReturnOptions\fR
routine.  In its place, the global Tcl variables \fBerrorInfo\fR
and \fBerrorCode\fR were the only place to retrieve the error
information.  Much existing code written for older Tcl releases
still access this information via those global variables.
.PP
It is important to realize that while reading from those
global variables remains a supported way to access these
return option values, it is important not to assume that
writing to those global variables will properly set the
corresponding return options.  It has long been emphasized
in this manual page that it is important to 
call the procedures described here rather than
setting \fBerrorInfo\fR or \fBerrorCode\fR directly with
\fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR.
.PP
If the procedure \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR is called,
it clears all of the state of the interpreter associated with
script evaluation, including the entire return options dictionary.
In particular, the \fB\-errorinfo\fR and \fB\-errorcode\fR options
are reset.  
If an error had occurred, the \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR call will
clear the error state to make it appear as if no error had
occurred after all.
The global variables \fBerrorInfo\fR and
\fBerrorCode\fR are not modified by \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR
so they continue to hold a record of information about the
most recent error seen in an interpreter.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These three procedures help implement a simple reference count mechanism
for managing storage.  They are designed to solve a problem
having to do with widget deletion, but are also useful in many other
situations.  When a widget is deleted, its
widget record (the structure holding information specific to the
widget) must be returned to the storage allocator.
However, it is possible that the widget record is in active use
by one of the procedures on the stack at the time of the deletion.
This can happen, for example, if the command associated with a button
widget causes the button to be destroyed:  an X event causes an
event-handling C procedure in the button to be invoked, which in
turn causes the button's associated Tcl command to be executed,
which in turn causes the button to be deleted, which in turn causes
the button's widget record to be de-allocated.
Unfortunately, when the Tcl command returns, the button's
event-handling procedure will need to reference the
button's widget record.
Because of this, the widget record must not be freed as part of the
deletion, but must be retained until the event-handling procedure has
finished with it.
In other situations where the widget is deleted, it may be possible
to free the widget record immediately.
.PP
\fBTcl_Preserve\fR and \fBTcl_Release\fR
implement short-term reference counts for their \fIclientData\fR
argument.
The \fIclientData\fR argument identifies an object and usually
consists of the address of a structure.
The reference counts guarantee that an object will not be freed
until each call to \fBTcl_Preserve\fR for the object has been
matched by calls to \fBTcl_Release\fR.
There may be any number of unmatched \fBTcl_Preserve\fR calls
in effect at once.
.PP
\fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR is invoked to free up its \fIclientData\fR
argument.
It checks to see if there are unmatched \fBTcl_Preserve\fR calls
for the object.
If not, then \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR calls \fIfreeProc\fR immediately.
Otherwise \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR records the fact that \fIclientData\fR
needs eventually to be freed.
When all calls to \fBTcl_Preserve\fR have been matched with
calls to \fBTcl_Release\fR then \fIfreeProc\fR will be called by
\fBTcl_Release\fR to do the cleanup.
.PP
All the work of freeing the object is carried out by \fIfreeProc\fR.
\fIFreeProc\fR must have arguments and result that match the
type \fBTcl_FreeProc\fR:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *\fIblockPtr\fR);
.CE
The \fIblockPtr\fR argument to \fIfreeProc\fR will be the
same as the \fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR.
The type of \fIblockPtr\fR (\fBchar *\fR) is different than the type of the
\fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR for historical
reasons, but the value is the same.
.PP
When the \fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR
refers to storage allocated and returned by a prior call to
\fBTcl_Alloc\fR, \fBckalloc\fR, or another function of the Tcl library,
then the \fIfreeProc\fR argument should be given the special value of
\fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR.
.PP
This mechanism can be used to solve the problem described above
by placing \fBTcl_Preserve\fR and \fBTcl_Release\fR calls around
actions that may cause undesired storage re-allocation.  The
mechanism is intended only for short-term use (i.e. while procedures
are pending on the stack);  it will not work efficiently as a
mechanism for long-term reference counts.
The implementation does not depend in any way on the internal
structure of the objects being freed;  it keeps the reference
counts in a separate structure.

.SH NAME
Tcl_PrintDouble \- Convert floating value to string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR(\fIinterp, value, dst\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Before Tcl 8.0, the \fBtcl_precision\fR variable in this interpreter
controlled the conversion.  As of Tcl 8.0, this argument is ignored and
the conversion is controlled by the \fBtcl_precision\fR variable
that is now shared by all interpreters.
.AP double value in
Floating-point value to be converted.
.AP char *dst out
Where to store the string representing \fIvalue\fR.  Must have at
least \fBTCL_DOUBLE_SPACE\fR characters of storage.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR generates a string that represents the value
of \fIvalue\fR and stores it in memory at the location given by
\fIdst\fR.  It uses \fB%g\fR format to generate the string, with one
special twist: the string is guaranteed to contain either a
.QW .
or an
.QW e
so that it does not look like an integer.  Where \fB%g\fR would
generate an integer with no decimal point, \fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR adds
.QW .0 .
.VS 8.5
.PP
If the \fBtcl_precision\fR value is non-zero, the result will have
precisely that many digits of significance.  If the value is zero
(the default), the result will have the fewest digits needed to
represent the number in such a way that \fBTcl_NewDoubleObj\fR
will generate the same number when presented with the given string.
IEEE semantics of rounding to even apply to the conversion.
.VE

.QW \fINAME\fB=\fIvalue\fR .
This procedure is
intended to be a stand-in for the UNIX \fBputenv\fR system call. All
Tcl-based applications using \fBputenv\fR should redefine it to
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR so that they will interface properly to the Tcl
runtime.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBTcl_GetTime\fR function retrieves the current time as a
\fITcl_Time\fR structure in memory the caller provides.  This
structure has the following definition:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Time {
    long sec;
    long usec;
} Tcl_Time;
.CE
.PP
On return, the \fIsec\fR member of the structure is filled in with the
number of seconds that have elapsed since the \fIepoch:\fR the epoch
is the point in time of 00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.  This number does
\fInot\fR count leap seconds \- an interval of one day advances it by
86400 seconds regardless of whether a leap second has been inserted.
.PP
The \fIusec\fR member of the structure is filled in with the number of
microseconds that have elapsed since the start of the second
designated by \fIsec\fR.  The Tcl library makes every effort to keep
this number as precise as possible, subject to the limitations of the
computer system.  On multiprocessor variants of Windows, this number
may be limited to the 10- or 20-ms granularity of the system clock.
(On single-processor Windows systems, the \fIusec\fR field is derived
from a performance counter and is highly precise.)
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetTime\fR function registers two related handler functions
with the core. The first handler function is a replacement for
\fBTcl_GetTime\fR, or rather the OS access made by
\fBTcl_GetTime\fR. The other handler function is used by the Tcl
notifier to convert wait/block times from the virtual domain into real
time.
.PP
The \fBTcl_QueryTime\fR function returns the currently registered
handler functions. If no external handlers were set then this will
return the standard handlers accessing and processing the native time
of the OS. The arguments to the function are allowed to be NULL; and
any argument which is NULL is ignored and not set.
.PP
Any handler pair specified has to return data which is consistent
between them. In other words, setting one handler of the pair to
something assuming a 10-times slowdown, and the other handler of the
pair to something assuming a two-times slowdown is wrong and not
allowed.
.PP
The set handler functions are allowed to run the delivered time
backwards, however this should be avoided. We have to allow it as the
native time can run backwards as the user can fiddle with the system
time one way or other. Note that the insertion of the hooks will not
change the behaviour of the Tcl core with regard to this situation,
i.e. the existing behaviour is retained.

.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
The interfaces described here are used to customize the Tcl event
loop.  The two most common customizations are to add new sources of
events and to merge Tcl's event loop with some other event loop, such
as one provided by an application in which Tcl is embedded.  Each of
these tasks is described in a separate section below.
.PP
The procedures in this manual entry are the building blocks out of which
the Tcl event notifier is constructed.  The event notifier is the lowest
layer in the Tcl event mechanism.  It consists of three things:
.IP [1]
Event sources: these represent the ways in which events can be
generated.  For example, there is a timer event source that implements
the \fBTcl_CreateTimerHandler\fR procedure and the \fBafter\fR
command, and there is a file event source that implements the
\fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR procedure on Unix systems.  An event
source must work with the notifier to detect events at the right
times, record them on the event queue, and eventually notify
higher-level software that they have occurred.  The procedures
\fBTcl_CreateEventSource\fR, \fBTcl_DeleteEventSource\fR,
and \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR, \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR, and
\fBTcl_DeleteEvents\fR are used primarily by event sources.
.IP [2]
The event queue: for non-threaded applications,
there is a single queue for the whole application,
containing events that have been detected but not yet serviced.  Event
sources place events onto the queue so that they may be processed in
order at appropriate times during the event loop. The event queue
guarantees a fair discipline of event handling, so that no event
source can starve the others.  It also allows events to be saved for
servicing at a future time.  Threaded applications work in a
similar manner, except that there is a separate event queue for
each thread containing a Tcl interpreter.
\fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR is used (primarily
by event sources) to add events to the event queue and 
\fBTcl_DeleteEvents\fR is used to remove events from the queue without
processing them.  In a threaded application, \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR adds
an event to the current thread's queue, and \fBTcl_ThreadQueueEvent\fR
adds an event to a queue in a specific thread.
.IP [3]
The event loop: in order to detect and process events, the application
enters a loop that waits for events to occur, places them on the event
queue, and then processes them.  Most applications will do this by
calling the procedure \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR, which is described in a
separate manual entry.
.PP
Most Tcl applications need not worry about any of the internals of
the Tcl notifier.  However, the notifier now has enough flexibility
to be retargeted either for a new platform or to use an external event
loop (such as the Motif event loop, when Tcl is embedded in a Motif
application).  The procedures \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR and
\fBTcl_SetTimer\fR are normally implemented by Tcl, but may be
replaced with new versions to retarget the notifier (the
\fBTcl_InitNotifier\fR, \fBTcl_AlertNotifier\fR,
\fBTcl_FinalizeNotifier\fR, \fBTcl_Sleep\fR,
\fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR, and \fBTcl_DeleteFileHandler\fR must
also be replaced; see CREATING A NEW NOTIFIER below for details).
The procedures \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR, \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR,
\fBTcl_GetServiceMode\fR, and \fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR are provided
to help connect Tcl's event loop to an external event loop such as
Motif's.
.SH "NOTIFIER BASICS"
.PP
The easiest way to understand how the notifier works is to consider
what happens when \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR is called.
\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR is passed a \fIflags\fR argument that indicates
what sort of events it is OK to process and also whether or not to
block if no events are ready.  \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR does the following
things:
.IP [1]
Check the event queue to see if it contains any events that can
be serviced.  If so, service the first possible event, remove it
from the queue, and return.  It does this by calling
\fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR and passing in the \fIflags\fR argument.
.IP [2]
Prepare to block for an event.  To do this, \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR
invokes a \fIsetup procedure\fR in each event source.
The event source will perform event-source specific initialization and
possibly call \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR to limit how long
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR will block if no new events occur.
.IP [3]
Call \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR.  This procedure is implemented differently
on different platforms;  it waits for an event to occur, based on the
information provided by the event sources.
It may cause the application to block if \fItimePtr\fR specifies
an interval other than 0.
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR returns when something has happened,
such as a file becoming readable or the interval given by \fItimePtr\fR
expiring.  If there are no events for \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR to
wait for, so that it would block forever, then it returns immediately
and \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR returns 0.
.IP [4]
Call a \fIcheck procedure\fR in each event source.  The check
procedure determines whether any events of interest to this source
occurred.  If so, the events are added to the event queue.
.IP [5]
Check the event queue to see if it contains any events that can
be serviced.  If so, service the first possible event, remove it
from the queue, and return.
.IP [6]
See if there are idle callbacks pending. If so, invoke all of them and
return.
.IP [7]
Either return 0 to indicate that no events were ready, or go back to
step [2] if blocking was requested by the caller.

.SH "CREATING A NEW EVENT SOURCE"
.PP
An event source consists of three procedures invoked by the notifier,
plus additional C procedures that are invoked by higher-level code
to arrange for event-driven callbacks.  The three procedures called
by the notifier consist of the setup and check procedures described
above, plus an additional procedure that is invoked when an event
is removed from the event queue for servicing.
.PP
The procedure \fBTcl_CreateEventSource\fR creates a new event source.
Its arguments specify the setup procedure and check procedure for
the event source.
\fISetupProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_EventSetupProc(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
        int \fIflags\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR argument will be the same as the \fIclientData\fR
argument to \fBTcl_CreateEventSource\fR;  it is typically used to
point to private information managed by the event source.
The \fIflags\fR argument will be the same as the \fIflags\fR
argument passed to \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR except that it will never
be 0 (\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR replaces 0 with \fBTCL_ALL_EVENTS\fR).
\fIFlags\fR indicates what kinds of events should be considered;
if the bit corresponding to this event source is not set, the event
source should return immediately without doing anything.  For
example, the file event source checks for the \fBTCL_FILE_EVENTS\fR
bit.
.PP
\fISetupProc\fR's job is to make sure that the application wakes up
when events of the desired type occur.  This is typically done in a
platform-dependent fashion.  For example, under Unix an event source
might call \fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR; under Windows it might
request notification with a Windows event.  For timer-driven event
sources such as timer events or any polled event, the event source
can call \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR to force the application to wake
up after a specified time even if no events have occurred.
If no event source calls \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR
then \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR will wait as long as necessary for an
event to occur; otherwise, it will only wait as long as the shortest
interval passed to \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR by one of the event
sources.  If an event source knows that it already has events ready to
report, it can request a zero maximum block time.  For example, the
setup procedure for the X event source looks to see if there are
events already queued.  If there are, it calls
\fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR with a 0 block time so that
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR does not block if there is no new data on the X
connection.
The \fItimePtr\fR argument to \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR points to
a structure that describes a time interval in seconds and
microseconds:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Time {
        long \fIsec\fR;
        long \fIusec\fR;
} Tcl_Time;
.CE
The \fIusec\fR field should be less than 1000000.
.PP
Information provided to \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR
is only used for the next call to \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR; it is
discarded after \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR returns.
The next time an event wait is done each of the event sources'
setup procedures will be called again, and they can specify new
information for that event wait.
.PP
If the application uses an external event loop rather than
\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR, the event sources may need to call
\fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR at other times.  For example, if a new event
handler is registered that needs to poll for events, the event source
may call \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR to set the block time to zero to
force the external event loop to call Tcl.  In this case,
\fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR invokes \fBTcl_SetTimer\fR with the shortest
interval seen since the last call to \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR or
\fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR.
.PP
In addition to the generic procedure \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR, other
platform-specific procedures may also be available for
\fIsetupProc\fR, if there is additional information needed by
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR on that platform.  For example, on Unix systems
the \fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR interface can be used to wait for file events.
.PP
The second procedure provided by each event source is its check
procedure, indicated by the \fIcheckProc\fR argument to
\fBTcl_CreateEventSource\fR.  \fICheckProc\fR must match the
following prototype:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_EventCheckProc(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
        int \fIflags\fR);
.CE
The arguments to this procedure are the same as those for \fIsetupProc\fR.
\fBCheckProc\fR is invoked by \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR after it has waited
for events.  Presumably at least one event source is now prepared to
queue an event.  \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR calls each of the event sources
in turn, so they all have a chance to queue any events that are ready.
The check procedure does two things.  First, it must see if any events
have triggered.  Different event sources do this in different ways.
.PP
If an event source's check procedure detects an interesting event, it
must add the event to Tcl's event queue.  To do this, the event source
calls \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR.  The \fIevPtr\fR argument is a pointer to
a dynamically allocated structure containing the event (see below for
more information on memory management issues).  Each event source can
define its own event structure with whatever information is relevant
to that event source.  However, the first element of the structure
must be a structure of type \fBTcl_Event\fR, and the address of this
structure is used when communicating between the event source and the
rest of the notifier.  A \fBTcl_Event\fR has the following definition:
.CS
typedef struct {
    Tcl_EventProc *\fIproc\fR;
    struct Tcl_Event *\fInextPtr\fR;
} Tcl_Event;
.CE
The event source must fill in the \fIproc\fR field of
the event before calling \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR.
The \fInextPtr\fR is used to link together the events in the queue
and should not be modified by the event source.
.PP
An event may be added to the queue at any of three positions, depending
on the \fIposition\fR argument to \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR:
.IP \fBTCL_QUEUE_TAIL\fR 24
Add the event at the back of the queue, so that all other pending
events will be serviced first.  This is almost always the right
place for new events.
.IP \fBTCL_QUEUE_HEAD\fR 24
Add the event at the front of the queue, so that it will be serviced
before all other queued events.
.IP \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR 24
Add the event at the front of the queue, unless there are other
events at the front whose position is \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR;  if so,
add the new event just after all other \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR events.
This value of \fIposition\fR is used to insert an ordered sequence of
events at the front of the queue, such as a series of
Enter and Leave events synthesized during a grab or ungrab operation
in Tk.
.PP
When it is time to handle an event from the queue (steps 1 and 4
above) \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR will invoke the \fIproc\fR specified
in the first queued \fBTcl_Event\fR structure.
\fIProc\fR must match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef int Tcl_EventProc(
        Tcl_Event *\fIevPtr\fR,
        int \fIflags\fR);
.CE
The first argument to \fIproc\fR is a pointer to the event, which will
be the same as the first argument to the \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR call that
added the event to the queue.
The second argument to \fIproc\fR is the \fIflags\fR argument for the
current call to \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR;  this is used by the event source
to return immediately if its events are not relevant.
.PP
It is up to \fIproc\fR to handle the event, typically by invoking
one or more Tcl commands or C-level callbacks.
Once the event source has finished handling the event it returns 1
to indicate that the event can be removed from the queue.
If for some reason the event source decides that the event cannot
be handled at this time, it may return 0 to indicate that the event
should be deferred for processing later;  in this case \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR
will go on to the next event in the queue and attempt to service it.
There are several reasons why an event source might defer an event.
One possibility is that events of this type are excluded by the
\fIflags\fR argument.
For example, the file event source will always return 0 if the
\fBTCL_FILE_EVENTS\fR bit is not set in \fIflags\fR.
Another example of deferring events happens in Tk if
\fBTk_RestrictEvents\fR has been invoked to defer certain kinds
of window events.
.PP
When \fIproc\fR returns 1, \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR will remove the
event from the event queue and free its storage.
Note that the storage for an event must be allocated by
the event source (using \fBTcl_Alloc\fR or the Tcl macro \fBckalloc\fR)
before calling \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR, but it
will be freed by \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR, not by the event source.
.PP
Threaded applications work in a
similar manner, except that there is a separate event queue for
each thread containing a Tcl interpreter.
Calling \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR in a multithreaded application adds
an event to the current thread's queue.
To add an event to another thread's queue, use \fBTcl_ThreadQueueEvent\fR.
\fBTcl_ThreadQueueEvent\fR accepts as an argument a Tcl_ThreadId argument,
which uniquely identifies a thread in a Tcl application.  To obtain the
Tcl_ThreadID for the current thread, use the \fBTcl_GetCurrentThread\fR
procedure.  (A thread would then need to pass this identifier to other
threads for those threads to be able to add events to its queue.)
After adding an event to another thread's queue, you then typically
need to call \fBTcl_ThreadAlert\fR to
.QW "wake up"
that thread's notifier to alert it to the new event.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteEvents\fR can be used to explicitly remove one or more
events from the event queue.  \fBTcl_DeleteEvents\fR calls \fIproc\fR
for each event in the queue, deleting those for with the procedure
returns 1.  Events for which the procedure returns 0 are left in the
queue.  \fIProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef int Tcl_EventDeleteProc(
        Tcl_Event *\fIevPtr\fR,
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR argument will be the same as the \fIclientData\fR
argument to \fBTcl_DeleteEvents\fR; it is typically used to point to
private information managed by the event source.  The \fIevPtr\fR will
point to the next event in the queue.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteEventSource\fR deletes an event source.  The \fIsetupProc\fR,
\fIcheckProc\fR, and \fIclientData\fR arguments must exactly match those
provided to the \fBTcl_CreateEventSource\fR for the event source to be deleted.
If no such source exists, \fBTcl_DeleteEventSource\fR has no effect.

.SH "CREATING A NEW NOTIFIER"
.PP
The notifier consists of all the procedures described in this manual
entry, plus \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR and \fBTcl_Sleep\fR, which are
available on all platforms, and \fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR and
\fBTcl_DeleteFileHandler\fR, which are Unix-specific.  Most of these
procedures are generic, in that they are the same for all notifiers.
However, none of the procedures are notifier-dependent:
\fBTcl_InitNotifier\fR, \fBTcl_AlertNotifier\fR,
\fBTcl_FinalizeNotifier\fR, \fBTcl_SetTimer\fR, \fBTcl_Sleep\fR,
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR, \fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR,
\fBTcl_DeleteFileHandler\fR and \fBTcl_ServiceModeHook\fR.  To support a
new platform or to integrate Tcl with an application-specific event loop,
you must write new versions of these procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_InitNotifier\fR initializes the notifier state and returns
a handle to the notifier state.  Tcl calls this
procedure when initializing a Tcl interpreter.  Similarly,
\fBTcl_FinalizeNotifier\fR shuts down the notifier, and is
called by \fBTcl_Finalize\fR when shutting down a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR is the lowest-level procedure in the notifier;
it is responsible for waiting for an
.QW interesting
event to occur or
for a given time to elapse.  Before \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR is invoked,
each of the event sources' setup procedure will have been invoked.
The \fItimePtr\fR argument to
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR gives the maximum time to block for an event,
based on calls to \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR made by setup procedures
and on other information (such as the \fBTCL_DONT_WAIT\fR bit in
\fIflags\fR).
.PP
Ideally, \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR should only wait for an event
to occur; it should not actually process the event in any way.
Later on, the
event sources will process the raw events and create Tcl_Events on
the event queue in their \fIcheckProc\fR procedures.
However, on some platforms (such as Windows) this is not possible;
events may be processed in \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR, including queuing
Tcl_Events and more (for example, callbacks for native widgets may be
invoked).  The return value from \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR must be either
0, 1, or \-1.  On platforms such as Windows where events get processed in
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR, a return value of 1 means that there may be more
events still pending that have not been processed.  This is a sign to the
caller that it must call \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR again if it wants all
pending events to be processed. A 0 return value means that calling
\fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR again will not have any effect: either this is a
platform where \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR only waits without doing any event
processing, or \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR knows for sure that there are no
additional events to process (e.g. it returned because the time
elapsed).  Finally, a return value of \-1 means that the event loop is
no longer operational and the application should probably unwind and
terminate.  Under Windows this happens when a WM_QUIT message is received;
under Unix it happens when \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR would have waited
forever because there were no active event sources and the timeout was
infinite.
.PP
\fBTcl_AlertNotifier\fR is used in multithreaded applications to allow
any thread to
.QW "wake up"
the notifier to alert it to new events on its
queue.  \fBTcl_AlertNotifier\fR requires as an argument the notifier
handle returned by \fBTcl_InitNotifier\fR.
.PP
If the notifier will be used with an external event loop, then it must
also support the \fBTcl_SetTimer\fR interface.  \fBTcl_SetTimer\fR is
invoked by \fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR whenever the maximum blocking
time has been reduced.  \fBTcl_SetTimer\fR should arrange for the
external event loop to invoke \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR after the specified
interval even if no events have occurred.  This interface is needed
because \fBTcl_WaitForEvent\fR is not invoked when there is an external
event loop.  If the
notifier will only be used from \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR, then
\fBTcl_SetTimer\fR need not do anything.
.PP
\fBTcl_ServiceModeHook\fR is called by the platform-independent portion
of the notifier when client code makes a call to
\fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR. This hook is provided to support operating
systems that require special event handling when the application is in
a modal loop (the Windows notifier, for instance, uses this hook to
create a communication window).
.PP
On Unix systems, the file event source also needs support from the
notifier.  The file event source consists of the
\fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR and \fBTcl_DeleteFileHandler\fR
procedures, which are described in the \fBTcl_CreateFileHandler\fR
manual page.
.PP
The \fBTcl_Sleep\fR and \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR interfaces are described
in their respective manual pages.
.PP
The easiest way to create a new notifier is to look at the code
for an existing notifier, such as the files \fBunix/tclUnixNotfy.c\fR
or \fBwin/tclWinNotify.c\fR in the Tcl source distribution.

.SH "REPLACING THE NOTIFIER"
.PP
A notifier that has been written according to the conventions above
can also be installed in a running process in place of the standard
notifier.  This mechanism is used so that a single executable can be
used (with the standard notifier) as a stand-alone program and reused
(with a replacement notifier in a loadable extension) as an extension
to another program, such as a Web browser plugin.
.PP
To do this, the extension makes a call to \fBTcl_SetNotifier\fR
passing a pointer to a \fBTcl_NotifierProcs\fR data structure.  The
structure has the following layout:
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_NotifierProcs {
    Tcl_SetTimerProc *setTimerProc;
    Tcl_WaitForEventProc *waitForEventProc;
    Tcl_CreateFileHandlerProc *createFileHandlerProc;
    Tcl_DeleteFileHandlerProc *deleteFileHandlerProc;

Following the call to \fBTcl_SetNotifier\fR, the pointers given in
the \fBTcl_NotifierProcs\fR structure replace whatever notifier had
been installed in the process.
.PP
It is extraordinarily unwise to replace a running notifier. Normally,
\fBTcl_SetNotifier\fR should be called at process initialization time
before the first call to \fBTcl_InitNotifier\fR.

.SH "EXTERNAL EVENT LOOPS"
.PP
The notifier interfaces are designed so that Tcl can be embedded into
applications that have their own private event loops.  In this case,
the application does not call \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR except in the case
of recursive event loops such as calls to the Tcl commands \fBupdate\fR
or \fBvwait\fR.  Most of the time is spent in the external event loop
of the application.  In this case the notifier must arrange for the
external event loop to call back into Tcl when something
happens on the various Tcl event sources.  These callbacks should
arrange for appropriate Tcl events to be placed on the Tcl event queue.
.PP
Because the external event loop is not calling \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR on
a regular basis, it is up to the notifier to arrange for
\fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR to be called whenever events are pending on the
Tcl event queue.  The easiest way to do this is to invoke
\fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR at the end of each callback from the external
event loop.  This will ensure that all of the event sources are
polled, any queued events are serviced, and any pending idle handlers
are processed before returning control to the application.  In
addition, event sources that need to poll for events can call
\fBTcl_SetMaxBlockTime\fR to force the external event loop to call
Tcl even if no events are available on the system event queue.
.PP
As a side effect of processing events detected in the main external
event loop, Tcl may invoke \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR to start a recursive event
loop in commands like \fBvwait\fR.  \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR will invoke
the external event loop, which will result in callbacks as described
in the preceding paragraph, which will result in calls to
\fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR.  However, in these cases it is undesirable to
service events in \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR.  Servicing events there is
unnecessary because control will immediately return to the
external event loop and hence to \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR, which can
service the events itself.  Furthermore, \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR is
supposed to service only a single event, whereas \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR
normally services all pending events.  To handle this situation,
\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR sets a flag for \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR
that causes it to return without servicing any events.
This flag is called the \fIservice mode\fR;
\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR restores it to its previous value before it returns.
.PP
In some cases, however, it may be necessary for \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR
to service events
even when it has been invoked from \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR.  This happens
when there is yet another recursive event loop invoked via an
event handler called by \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR (such as one that is
part of a native widget).  In this case, \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR may not
have a chance to service events so \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR must service
them all.  Any recursive event loop that calls an external event
loop rather than \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR must reset the service mode so
that all events get processed in \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR.  This is done
by invoking the \fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR procedure.  If
\fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR is passed \fBTCL_SERVICE_NONE\fR, then calls
to \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR will return immediately without processing any
events.  If \fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR is passed \fBTCL_SERVICE_ALL\fR,
then calls to \fBTcl_ServiceAll\fR will behave normally.
\fBTcl_SetServiceMode\fR returns the previous value of the service
mode, which should be restored when the recursive loop exits.
\fBTcl_GetServiceMode\fR returns the current value of the service
mode.

.AS Tcl_DString *channelName in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Used for error reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.
.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.  
.AP int permissions in
POSIX-style permission flags such as 0644.  If a new file is created, these
permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in
Operating system specific handle for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a
file descriptor, for Windows it is a HANDLE.
.AP int readOrWrite in
OR-ed combination of \fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR to indicate
what operations are valid on \fIhandle\fR.
.AP "const char" *channelName in
The name of the channel. 
.AP int *modePtr out
Points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR denoting whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
The pattern to match on, passed to Tcl_StringMatch, or NULL.
.AP Tcl_Channel channel in
A Tcl channel for input or output.  Must have been the return value
from a procedure such as \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR.
.AP Tcl_Obj *readObjPtr in/out
A pointer to a Tcl Object in which to store the characters read from the
channel.
.AP int charsToRead in
The number of characters to read from the channel.  If the channel's encoding 
is \fBbinary\fR, this is equivalent to the number of bytes to read from the 
channel.
.AP int appendFlag in
If non-zero, data read from the channel will be appended to the object.
Otherwise, the data will replace the existing contents of the object.
.AP char *readBuf out
A buffer in which to store the bytes read from the channel.
.AP int bytesToRead in
The number of bytes to read from the channel.  The buffer \fIreadBuf\fR must
be large enough to hold this many bytes.
.AP Tcl_Obj *lineObjPtr in/out
A pointer to a Tcl object in which to store the line read from the
channel.  The line read will be appended to the current value of the
object. 
.AP Tcl_DString *lineRead in/out
A pointer to a Tcl dynamic string in which to store the line read from the
channel.  Must have been initialized by the caller.  The line read will be
appended to any data already in the dynamic string.
.AP "const char" *input in
The input to add to a channel buffer.
.AP int inputLen in
Length of the input
.AP int addAtEnd in
Flag indicating whether the input should be added to the end or
beginning of the channel buffer.
.AP Tcl_Obj *writeObjPtr in
A pointer to a Tcl Object whose contents will be output to the channel.
.AP "const char" *charBuf in
A buffer containing the characters to output to the channel.
.AP "const char" *byteBuf in
A buffer containing the bytes to output to the channel.
.AP int bytesToWrite in
The number of bytes to consume from \fIcharBuf\fR or \fIbyteBuf\fR and
output to the channel.
.AP Tcl_WideInt offset in
How far to move the access point in the channel at which the next input or
output operation will be applied, measured in bytes from the position
given by \fIseekMode\fR.  May be either positive or negative.
.AP int seekMode in
Relative to which point to seek; used with \fIoffset\fR to calculate the new
access point for the channel. Legal values are \fBSEEK_SET\fR,
\fBSEEK_CUR\fR, and \fBSEEK_END\fR.
.AP Tcl_WideInt length in
The (non-negative) length to truncate the channel the channel to.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

Used for error reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.
.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.  
.AP int permissions in
POSIX-style permission flags such as 0644.  If a new file is created, these
permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in
Operating system specific handle for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a
file descriptor, for Windows it is a HANDLE.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.  
.AP int permissions in
POSIX-style permission flags such as 0644.  If a new file is created, these
permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in
Operating system specific handle for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a
file descriptor, for Windows it is a HANDLE.
.AP int readOrWrite in
OR-ed combination of \fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR to indicate
what operations are valid on \fIhandle\fR.
.AP "const char" *channelName in
The name of the channel.

If non-zero, data read from the channel will be appended to the object.
Otherwise, the data will replace the existing contents of the object.
.AP char *readBuf out
A buffer in which to store the bytes read from the channel.
.AP int bytesToRead in
The number of bytes to read from the channel.  The buffer \fIreadBuf\fR must
be large enough to hold this many bytes.
.AP Tcl_Obj *lineObjPtr in/out
A pointer to a Tcl object in which to store the line read from the
channel.  The line read will be appended to the current value of the
object. 
.AP Tcl_DString *lineRead in/out
A pointer to a Tcl dynamic string in which to store the line read from the

Relative to which point to seek; used with \fIoffset\fR to calculate the new
access point for the channel. Legal values are \fBSEEK_SET\fR,
\fBSEEK_CUR\fR, and \fBSEEK_END\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide a platform and compiler independent interface
for memory allocation.  Programs that need to transfer ownership of
memory blocks between Tcl and other modules should use these routines
rather than the native \fBmalloc()\fR and \fBfree()\fR routines
provided by the C run-time library.
.PP
\fBTcl_Alloc\fR returns a pointer to a block of at least \fIsize\fR
bytes suitably aligned for any use.
.PP
\fBTcl_Free\fR makes the space referred to by \fIptr\fR available for
further allocation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Realloc\fR changes the size of the block pointed to by
\fIptr\fR to \fIsize\fR bytes and returns a pointer to the new block.
The contents will be unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old
sizes.  The returned location may be different from \fIptr\fR.  If
\fIptr\fR is NULL, this is equivalent to calling \fBTcl_Alloc\fR with
just the \fIsize\fR argument.
.PP
\fBTcl_AttemptAlloc\fR and \fBTcl_AttemptRealloc\fR are identical in
function to \fBTcl_Alloc\fR and \fBTcl_Realloc\fR, except that
\fBTcl_AttemptAlloc\fR and \fBTcl_AttemptRealloc\fR will not cause the Tcl
interpreter to \fBpanic\fR if the memory allocation fails.  If the
allocation fails, these functions will return NULL.  Note that on some
platforms, but not all, attempting to allocate a zero-sized block of
memory will also cause these functions to return NULL.
.PP
The procedures \fBckalloc\fR, \fBckfree\fR, \fBckrealloc\fR,
\fBattemptckalloc\fR, and \fBattemptckrealloc\fR are implemented
as macros.  Normally, they are synonyms for the corresponding
procedures documented on this page.  When Tcl and all modules
calling Tcl are compiled with \fBTCL_MEM_DEBUG\fR defined, however,
these macros are redefined to be special debugging versions
of these procedures.  To support Tcl's memory debugging within a
module, use the macros rather than direct calls to \fBTcl_Alloc\fR, etc.

Tcl_Pid
\fBTcl_WaitPid\fR(\fIpid, statusPtr, options\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Pid *statusPtr out
.AP int numPids in
Number of process ids contained in the array pointed to by \fIpidPtr\fR.
.AP int *pidPtr in
Address of array containing \fInumPids\fR process ids.
.AP Tcl_Pid pid in
The id of the process (pipe) to wait for.
.AP int *statusPtr out
The result of waiting on a process (pipe). Either 0 or ECHILD.
.AP int options in
The options controlling the wait. WNOHANG specifies not to wait when
checking the process.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachPids\fR and \fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR provide a
mechanism for managing subprocesses that are running in background.
These procedures are needed because the parent of a process must
eventually invoke the \fBwaitpid\fR kernel call (or one of a few other
similar kernel calls) to wait for the child to exit.  Until the
parent waits for the child, the child's state cannot be completely
reclaimed by the system.  If a parent continually creates children
and doesn't wait on them, the system's process table will eventually
overflow, even if all the children have exited.
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachPids\fR may be called to ask Tcl to take responsibility
for one or more processes whose process ids are contained in the
\fIpidPtr\fR array passed as argument.  The caller presumably
has started these processes running in background and does not
want to have to deal with them again.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR invokes the \fBwaitpid\fR kernel call
on each of the background processes so that its state can be cleaned
up if it has exited.  If the process has not exited yet,
\fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR does not wait for it to exit;  it will check again
the next time it is invoked.
Tcl automatically calls \fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR each time the
\fBexec\fR command is executed, so in most cases it is not necessary
for any code outside of Tcl to invoke \fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR.
However, if you call \fBTcl_DetachPids\fR in situations where the
\fBexec\fR command may never get executed, you may wish to call
\fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR from time to time so that background
processes can be cleaned up.
.PP
\fBTcl_WaitPid\fR is a thin wrapper around the facilities provided by
the operating system to wait on the end of a spawned process and to
check a whether spawned process is still running. It is used by
\fBTcl_ReapDetachedProcs\fR and the channel system to portably access
the operating system.

.SH NAME
Tcl_RecordAndEval \- save command on history list before evaluating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR(\fIinterp, cmd, flags\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.
.AP "const char" *cmd in
Command (or sequence of commands) to execute.
.AP int flags in
An OR'ed combination of flag bits.  \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR means record the
command but do not evaluate it.  \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR means evaluate
the command at global level instead of the current stack level.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using \fBTcl_Eval\fR
(or \fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR if the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR bit is set in \fIflags\fR).
It returns a completion code such as \fBTCL_OK\fR just like \fBTcl_Eval\fR
and it leaves information in the interpreter's result.
If you do not want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_Eval\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.
If the \fIflags\fR argument contains the \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.
.PP
Note that \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR has been largely replaced by the
object-based procedure \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR.
That object-based procedure records and optionally executes
a command held in a Tcl object instead of a string.

.SH NAME
Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj \- save command on history list before evaluating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR(\fIinterp, cmdPtr, flags\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.
.AP Tcl_Obj *cmdPtr in
Points to a Tcl object containing a command (or sequence of commands)
to execute.
.AP int flags in
An OR'ed combination of flag bits.  \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR means record the
command but do not evaluate it.  \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR means evaluate
the command at global level instead of the current stack level.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR
(or \fBTcl_GlobalEvalObj\fR if the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR bit is set
in \fIflags\fR).
It returns a completion code such as \fBTCL_OK\fR just like \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR,
as well as a result object containing additional information
(a result value or error message)
that can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
If you do not want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently invoked commands.
If the \fIflags\fR argument contains the \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.
.AP Tcl_Obj *patObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get a regular expression. The
compiled regular expression is cached in the object.
.AP char *text in
Text to search for a match with a regular expression.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.
.AP int nmatches in
The number of matching subexpressions that should be remembered for
later use.  If this value is 0, then no subexpression match
information will be computed.  If the value is \-1, then
all of the matching subexpressions will be remembered.  Any other
value will be taken as the maximum number of subexpressions to
remember.
.AP int eflags in
OR-ed combination of the execution flags \fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR and
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR. See below for more information.
.AP Tcl_RegExpInfo *infoPtr out
The address of the location where information about a previous match
should be stored by \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.
.AP Tcl_Obj *patObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get a regular expression. The
compiled regular expression is cached in the object.
.AP char *text in
Text to search for a match with a regular expression.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.
.AP int nmatches in
The number of matching subexpressions that should be remembered for
later use.  If this value is 0, then no subexpression match
information will be computed.  If the value is \-1, then
all of the matching subexpressions will be remembered.  Any other
value will be taken as the maximum number of subexpressions to
remember.
.AP int eflags in
OR-ed combination of the execution flags \fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR and
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR. See below for more information.
.AP Tcl_RegExpInfo *infoPtr out
The address of the location where information about a previous match
should be stored by \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.
.AP Tcl_Obj *patObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get a regular expression. The
compiled regular expression is cached in the object.
.AP char *text in
Text to search for a match with a regular expression.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.
.AP int nmatches in
The number of matching subexpressions that should be remembered for
later use.  If this value is 0, then no subexpression match
information will be computed.  If the value is \-1, then
all of the matching subexpressions will be remembered.  Any other
value will be taken as the maximum number of subexpressions to
remember.
.AP int eflags in
OR-ed combination of the execution flags \fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR and
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR. See below for more information.
.AP Tcl_RegExpInfo *infoPtr out
The address of the location where information about a previous match
should be stored by \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.
.AP Tcl_Obj *patObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get a regular expression. The
compiled regular expression is cached in the object.
.AP char *text in
Text to search for a match with a regular expression.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.
.AP int nmatches in
The number of matching subexpressions that should be remembered for
later use.  If this value is 0, then no subexpression match
information will be computed.  If the value is \-1, then
all of the matching subexpressions will be remembered.  Any other
value will be taken as the maximum number of subexpressions to
remember.
.AP int eflags in
OR-ed combination of the execution flags \fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR and
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR. See below for more information.
.AP Tcl_RegExpInfo *infoPtr out
The address of the location where information about a previous match
should be stored by \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.

provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.
.AP Tcl_Obj *patObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get a regular expression. The
compiled regular expression is cached in the object.
.AP char *text in
Text to search for a match with a regular expression.
.AP "const char" *pattern in
String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR, \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.
.AP int nmatches in
The number of matching subexpressions that should be remembered for

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out
The address of the character just after the last one in the range
is stored here, or NULL if there is no such range.
.AP int cflags in
OR-ed combination of the compilation flags \fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR, \fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, \fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR,

\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR. See below for more information.
.AP int offset in
The character offset into the text where matching should begin.
The value of the offset has no impact on \fB^\fR matches.  This
behavior is controlled by \fIeflags\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_RegExpInfo *interp in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.  The interpreter may be
NULL if no error reporting is desired.
.AP Tcl_Obj *textObj in/out
Refers to the object from which to get the text to search.  The
internal representation of the object may be converted to a form that
can be efficiently searched.

String in the form of a regular expression pattern.
.AP Tcl_RegExp regexp in
Compiled regular expression.  Must have been returned previously
by \fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR.
.AP char *start in
If \fItext\fR is just a portion of some other string, this argument
identifies the beginning of the larger string.
If it is not the same as \fItext\fR, then no
.QW \fB^\fR
matches will be allowed.
.AP int index in
Specifies which range is desired:  0 means the range of the entire
match, 1 or greater means the range that matched a parenthesized
sub-expression.
.AP "const char" **startPtr out
The address of the first character in the range is stored here, or
NULL if there is no such range.
.AP "const char" **endPtr out

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIpattern\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page. 
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIpattern\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter result.
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR except it
operates on the Tcl objects \fItextObj\fR and \fIpatObj\fR instead of
UTF strings. 
\fBTcl_RegExpMatchObj\fR is generally more efficient than
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR, so it is the preferred interface.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, and \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR
provide lower-level access to the regular expression pattern matcher.
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR compiles a regular expression string into
the internal form used for efficient pattern matching.
The return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR.
If an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message
in the interpreter result.
Note:  the return value from \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR is only valid
up to the next call to \fBTcl_RegExpCompile\fR;  it is not safe to
retain these values for long periods of time.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR executes the regular expression pattern matcher.
It returns 1 if \fItext\fR contains a range of characters that
match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and
\-1 if an error occurs.
In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR leaves an error
message in the interpreter result.
When searching a string for multiple matches of a pattern,
it is important to distinguish between the start of the original
string and the start of the current search.
For example, when searching for the second occurrence of a
match, the \fItext\fR argument might point to the character
just after the first match;  however, it is important for the
pattern matcher to know that this is not the start of the entire string,
so that it does not allow
.QW \fB^\fR
atoms in the pattern to match.
The \fIstart\fR argument provides this information by pointing
to the start of the overall string containing \fItext\fR.
\fIStart\fR will be less than or equal to \fItext\fR;  if it
is less than \fItext\fR then no \fB^\fR matches will be allowed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR may be invoked after \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR
returns;  it provides detailed information about what ranges of
the string matched what parts of the pattern.
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR returns a pair of pointers in \fI*startPtr\fR
and \fI*endPtr\fR that identify a range of characters in
the source string for the most recent call to \fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR.
\fIIndex\fR indicates which of several ranges is desired:
if \fIindex\fR is 0, information is returned about the overall range
of characters that matched the entire pattern;  otherwise,
information is returned about the range of characters that matched the
\fIindex\fR'th parenthesized subexpression within the pattern.
If there is no range corresponding to \fIindex\fR then NULL
is stored in \fI*startPtr\fR and \fI*endPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR, and
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR are object interfaces that provide the most
direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.  For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly,
it is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions.  These interfaces handle the details of UTF
to Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance
through caching in the pattern and string objects.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR attempts to return a compiled regular
expression from the \fIpatObj\fR.  If the object does not already
contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create one
from the string in the object and assign it to the internal
representation of the \fIpatObj\fR.  The return value of this function
is of type \fBTcl_RegExp\fR.  The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR or \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR.  If an error
occurs while compiling the regular expression then
\fBTcl_GetRegExpFromObj\fR returns NULL and leaves an error message in
the interpreter result.  The regular expression token can be used as
long as the internal representation of \fIpatObj\fR refers to the
compiled form.  The \fIcflags\fR argument is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags that control the compilation of
\fIpatObj\fR:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR
Compile advanced regular expressions
.PQ ARE s .
This mode corresponds to
the normal regular expression syntax accepted by the Tcl \fBregexp\fR and
\fBregsub\fR commands.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR
Compile extended regular expressions
.PQ ERE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier
versions. 
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR
Compile basic regular expressions
.PQ BRE s .
This mode corresponds
to the regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities
like \fBsed\fR and \fBgrep\fR.  This is the default if no flags are
specified.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_EXPANDED\fR
Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using an
expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace.  This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white
space and #-to-end-of-line comments to be ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR
Compile a literal string, with all characters treated as ordinary characters.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOCASE\fR
Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NEWLINE\fR
Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either
regular expressions or strings.  With this flag,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline,
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
\fBREG_NEWLINE\fR is the bit-wise OR of \fBREG_NLSTOP\fR and
\fBREG_NLANCH\fR.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLSTOP\fR
Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $ .
In this mode,
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW .
never match newline.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NLANCH\fR
Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching,
with the behavior of
.QW ^
and
.QW $
(the
.QW anchors )
affected, but not the behavior of
.QW [^
bracket expressions and
.QW . .
In this mode
.QW ^
matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and
.QW $
matches
an empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
Compile for matching that reports only success or failure,
not what was matched.  This reduces compile overhead and may improve
performance.  Subsequent calls to \fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR or
\fBTcl_RegExpRange\fR will not report any match information.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR
Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial
match given more text (see below).
.RE
.PP
Only one of
\fBTCL_REG_EXTENDED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_ADVANCED\fR,
\fBTCL_REG_BASIC\fR, and
\fBTCL_REG_QUOTE\fR may be specified.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR executes the regular expression pattern
matcher.  It returns 1 if \fIobjPtr\fR contains a range of characters
that match \fIregexp\fR, 0 if no match is found, and \-1 if an error
occurs.  In the case of an error, \fBTcl_RegExpExecObj\fR leaves an
error message in the interpreter result.  The \fInmatches\fR value
indicates to the matcher how many subexpressions are of interest.  If
\fInmatches\fR is 0, then no subexpression match information is
recorded, which may allow the matcher to make various optimizations.
If the value is \-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered.  If the value is a positive integer, then only that number
of subexpressions will be remembered.  Matching begins at the
specified Unicode character index given by \fIoffset\fR.  Unlike
\fBTcl_RegExpExec\fR, the behavior of anchors is not affected by the
offset value.  Instead the behavior of the anchors is explicitly
controlled by the \fIeflags\fR argument, which is a bit-wise OR of
zero or more of the following flags:
.RS 2
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTBOL\fR
The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a
line or the beginning of the string, so
.QW ^
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eA\fR
matches.
.TP
\fBTCL_REG_NOTEOL\fR
The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so
.QW $
will not match there.
Note that this flag has no effect on how
.QW \fB\eZ\fR
matches.
.RE
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpGetInfo\fR retrieves information about the last match
performed with a given regular expression \fIregexp\fR.  The
\fIinfoPtr\fR argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        int \fInsubs\fR;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *\fImatches\fR;
        long \fIextendStart\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;
.CE
.PP
The \fInsubs\fR field contains a count of the number of parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression.  If the \fBTCL_REG_NOSUB\fR
was used, then this value will be zero.  The \fImatches\fR field
points to an array of \fInsubs\fR values that indicate the bounds of each
subexpression matched.  The first element in the array refers to the
range matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent elements
refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the order that they
appear in the pattern.  Each element is a structure that is defined as
follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        long \fIstart\fR;
        long \fIend\fR;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;
.CE
.PP
The \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within \fIobjPtr\fR where matching began.
The \fIstart\fR index identifies the first character of the matched
subexpression.  The \fIend\fR index identifies the first character
after the matched subexpression.  If the subexpression matched the
empty string, then \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR will be equal.  If the
subexpression did not participate in the match, then \fIstart\fR and
\fIend\fR will be set to \-1.
.PP
The \fIextendStart\fR field in \fBTcl_RegExpInfo\fR is only set if the
\fBTCL_REG_CANMATCH\fR flag was used.  It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur.  If a match was
found, this will be the same as the beginning of the current match.
If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest point at which a
match might occur if additional text is appended to the string.  If it
is no match is possible even with further text, this field will be set 
to \-1.

Used for error reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.
.AP "const char" *fileName in
The name of a local or network file.
.AP "const char" *mode in
Specifies how the file is to be accessed.  May have any of the values
allowed for the \fImode\fR argument to the Tcl \fBopen\fR command.

permissions will be set on the created file.
.AP int argc in
The number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP "const char" **argv in
Arguments for constructing a command pipeline.  These values have the same
meaning as the non-switch arguments to the Tcl \fBexec\fR command.
.AP int flags in
Specifies the disposition of the stdio handles in pipeline: OR-ed
combination of \fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, \fBTCL_STDERR\fR, and
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR. If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is set, stdin for the first child
in the pipe is the pipe channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard
input of the invoking process; likewise for \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR. If \fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then the pipe can
redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.  If it
is set, then such redirections cause an error.
.AP ClientData handle in

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input
and output operations on a variety of file, socket, and device
types.
The channel mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by
providing a low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel driver
interface is described in the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR. The
channel mechanism provides a buffering scheme modeled after
Unix's standard I/O, and it also allows for nonblocking I/O on
channels.
.PP
The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs of the
generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the channel
driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new types of
channels, see the manual entry for \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.

.SH TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR opens a file specified by \fIfileName\fR and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the \fBfopen\fR procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl \fBopen\fR command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL, \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR
leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result after any error.  
As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API \fBTcl_FSOpenFileChannel\fR should 
be used in preference to \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR wherever possible.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR provides a C-level interface to the
functions of the \fBexec\fR and \fBopen\fR commands.
It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified
by the \fIargv\fR and \fIargc\fR arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
The \fIflags\fR argument indicates what sort of communication will
exist with the command pipeline.
.PP
If the \fBTCL_STDIN\fR flag is set then the standard input for the
first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
will provide input to the subprocess.  If \fBTCL_STDIN\fR is not set,
then standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
application's standard input.  If \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR is set then
standard output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel;
otherwise it goes to this application's standard output.  If
\fBTCL_STDERR\fR is set, standard error output for all subprocesses is
returned to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this application's standard error.  If
\fBTCL_ENFORCE_MODE\fR is not set, then \fIargc\fR and \fIargv\fR can
redirect the stdio handles to override \fBTCL_STDIN\fR,
\fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
\fBTCL_STDIN\fR, \fBTCL_STDOUT\fR, and \fBTCL_STDERR\fR have been set.
.PP
If an error occurs while opening the channel, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
In addition, \fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR leaves an error message in
the interpreter's result if \fIinterp\fR is not NULL.
.PP
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR makes a \fBTcl_Channel\fR from an existing,
platform-specific, file handle.
The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter; to
register it, use \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, described below.
If one of the standard channels, \fBstdin, stdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR was
previously closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.

.SH TCL_GETCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannel\fR returns a channel given the \fIchannelName\fR used to
create it with \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in
\fIinterp\fR. If a channel by that name is not registered in that interpreter,
the procedure returns NULL. If the \fImodePtr\fR argument is not NULL, it
points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR and \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR describing whether the channel is
open for reading and writing.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a
list object.  \fBTcl_GetChannelNamesEx\fR will filter these names
according to the \fIpattern\fR.  If \fIpattern\fR is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering.  The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is \fBTCL_ERROR\fR,
and the error message is left in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR adds a channel to the set of channels accessible
in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using
the name given in the call to \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.  After this call,
the channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should
not call \fBTcl_Close\fR for the channel; the channel will be closed
automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.
.PP
Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate that it
wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can
be registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the
matching number of calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a
reference to a channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first
call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, they will get initialized by that
call. See \fBTcl_StandardChannels\fR for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
them.

.SH TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
If this operation removed the last registration of the channel in any
interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, it will now be closed.  \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR
is very similar to \fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR except that it will also
close the channel if no further references to it exist.

.SH TCL_DETACHCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR removes a channel from the set of channels
accessible in \fIinterp\fR. After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be
able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that interpreter.
Beyond that, this command has no further effect.  It cannot be used on
the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will return
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR if passed one of those channels.
.PP
Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
\fBTcl_DetachChannel\fR with \fIinterp\fR as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
reference to the channel, unlike \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, 
it will not be closed.

.SH TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL
.PP
\fBTcl_IsStandardChannel\fR tests whether a channel is one of the
three standard channels, stdin, stdout or stderr.  If so, it returns
1, otherwise 0.
.PP
No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or the standard 
channels are initialized or otherwise valid.

.SH TCL_CLOSE
.PP
\fBTcl_Close\fR destroys the channel \fIchannel\fR, which must denote a
currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
interpreter when \fBTcl_Close\fR is called. Buffered output is flushed to
the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
buffered input is discarded.  If this is a blocking channel, the call does
not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
output device.  If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered
output that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns
immediately; output is flushed in the background and the channel will be
closed once all of the buffered data has been output.  In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.
.PP
If the channel was closed successfully, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Close\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and records a
POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
If the channel is being closed synchronously and an error occurs during
closing of the channel and \fIinterp\fR is not NULL, an error message is
left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
Note: it is not safe to call \fBTcl_Close\fR on a channel that has been
registered using \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR; see the documentation for
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, above, for details. If the channel has ever
been given as the \fBchan\fR argument in a call to
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, you should instead use
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, which will internally call \fBTcl_Close\fR
when all calls to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR have been matched by
corresponding calls to \fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR.

.SH "TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ"
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes
to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing the produced data in 
\fIreadObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The return value of
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR is the number of characters, up to \fIcharsToRead\fR,
that were stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR.  If an error occurs while reading, the
return value is \-1 and \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR records a POSIX error code that
can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Setting \fIcharsToRead\fR to \fB\-1\fR will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
eof (blocking mode).
.PP
The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating that less
data than requested was available.  This is called a \fIshort read\fR.  In
blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file.  In nonblocking mode,
a short read can also occur if there is not enough input currently
available:  \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR returns a short count rather than waiting
for more data.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero indicates an
end-of-file condition.  If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a return
value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available or an
end-of-file condition.  Use \fBTcl_Eof\fR and \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR to tell
which of these conditions actually occurred.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadChars\fR translates the various end-of-line representations into
the canonical \fB\en\fR internal representation according to the current
end-of-line recognition mode.  End-of-line recognition and the various
platform-specific modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command.
.PP
As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are read.
Instead, they are stored in \fIreadObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object.  The string representation of this object will only be
constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR).  In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
from a channel, manipulated by calling \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and
related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Read\fR is similar to \fBTcl_ReadChars\fR, except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is deprecated
and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions.  It consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR and stores them in
\fIreadBuf\fR, performing end-of-line translations on the way.  The return value
of \fBTcl_Read\fR is the number of bytes, up to \fIbytesToRead\fR, written in
\fIreadBuf\fR.  The buffer produced by \fBTcl_Read\fR is not null-terminated.
Its contents are valid from the zeroth position up to and excluding the
position indicated by the return value.  
.PP
\fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Read\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Read\fR (and the other functions
in the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the
stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_ReadRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the channel below into the transformation.

.SH "TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_GetsObj\fR consumes bytes from \fIchannel\fR, converting the bytes to
UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of input has been
seen.  If the channel's encoding is \fBbinary\fR, each byte read from the
channel is treated as an individual Unicode character.  All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line character(s)
are appended to \fIlineObjPtr\fR's string representation.  The end-of-line
character(s) are read and discarded.
.PP
If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than or equal
to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in \fIlineObjPtr\fR.  If an
error occurs, \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.  \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR also
returns \-1 if the end of the file is reached; the \fBTcl_Eof\fR procedure
can be used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition.
.PP
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also be \-1 if
no data was available or the data that was available did not contain an
end-of-line character.  When \-1 is returned, the \fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR
procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel is blocked because
of input unavailability.
.PP
\fBTcl_Gets\fR is the same as \fBTcl_GetsObj\fR except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
\fIlineRead\fR rather than a Tcl object.

.SH "TCL_UNGETS"
.PP
\fBTcl_Ungets\fR is used to add data to the input queue of a channel,
at either the head or tail of the queue.  The pointer \fIinput\fR points
to the data that is to be added.  The length of the input to add is given
by \fIinputLen\fR.  A non-zero value of \fIaddAtEnd\fR indicates that the
data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue.  If \fIchannel\fR has a
.QW sticky
EOF set, no data will be
added to the input queue.  \fBTcl_Ungets\fR returns \fIinputLen\fR or
\-1 if an error occurs.

.SH "TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE"
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteChars\fR accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of character data at
\fIcharBuf\fR.  The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted to the
channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR expects \fIcharBuf\fR
to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
Data queued for output may not appear on the output device immediately, due
to internal buffering.  If the data should appear immediately, call
\fBTcl_Flush\fR after the call to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR, or set the 
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBnone\fR.  If you wish the data
to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output, set the
\fB\-buffering\fR option on the channel to \fBline\fR mode.
.PP
The return value of \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR is a count of how many bytes were
accepted for output to the channel.  This is either greater than zero to
indicate success or \-1 to indicate that an error occurred.  If an error
occurs, \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
.PP
Newline characters in the output data are translated to platform-specific
end-of-line sequences according to the \fB\-translation\fR option for the
channel.  This is done even if the channel has no encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel.  The
UTF-8 characters in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's string representation are converted
to the channel's encoding and queued for output to \fIchannel\fR.  
As a performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
\fBbinary\fR, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
Instead, the bytes in \fIwriteObjPtr\fR's internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel.  The byte-array representation
of the object will be constructed if it is needed.  In this way,
byte-oriented data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and related functions, and then written to a
channel without the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Write\fR is similar to \fBTcl_WriteChars\fR except that it does not do
encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding.  It is
deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with non-internationalized
Tcl extensions.  It accepts \fIbytesToWrite\fR bytes of data at
\fIbyteBuf\fR and queues them for output to \fIchannel\fR.  If
\fIbytesToWrite\fR is negative, \fBTcl_Write\fR expects \fIbyteBuf\fR to be
null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the null.
.PP
\fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Write\fR but does not
compensate for stacking. While \fBTcl_Write\fR (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost channel
in the stack the supplied channel is part of, \fBTcl_WriteRaw\fR does
not. Thus this function is \fBonly\fR usable for transformational
channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the middle of a stack of
channels, to move data from the transformation into the channel below
it.

.SH TCL_FLUSH
.PP
\fBTcl_Flush\fR causes all of the buffered output data for \fIchannel\fR
to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as possible.
If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts
a background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.
.PP
The return value is normally \fBTCL_OK\fR.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Flush\fR returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.

.SH TCL_SEEK
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR moves the access point in \fIchannel\fR where subsequent
data will be read or written. Buffered output is flushed to the channel and
buffered input is discarded, prior to the seek operation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Seek\fR normally returns the new access point.
If an error occurs, \fBTcl_Seek\fR returns \-1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
After an error, the access point may or may not have been moved.

.SH TCL_TELL
.PP
\fBTcl_Tell\fR returns the current access point for a channel. The returned
value is \-1 if the channel does not support seeking.

.SH TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL
.PP
.VS 8.5
\fBTcl_TruncateChannel\fR truncates the file underlying \fIchannel\fR
to a given \fIlength\fR of bytes. It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if the
operation succeeded, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR otherwise.
.VE 8.5

.SH TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChannelOption\fR retrieves, in \fIoptionValue\fR, the value of one of
the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of all options and
their values.  The \fIchannel\fR argument identifies the channel for which
to query an option or retrieve all options and their values.
If \fIoptionName\fR is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the option's value is copied to the Tcl dynamic string
denoted by \fIoptionValue\fR. If
\fIoptionName\fR is NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in \fIoptionValue\fR, using a series of calls to
\fBTcl_DStringAppendElement\fR. The various preexisting options and
their possible values are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
\fBfconfigure\fR command. Other options can be added by each channel type.
These channel type specific options are described in the manual entry for
the Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for example, the
additional options for TCP based channels are described in the manual entry
for the Tcl \fBsocket\fR command.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR. If an error occurs, it returns
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR and calls \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR to store an appropriate POSIX
error code.

.SH TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR sets a new value \fInewValue\fR
for an option \fIoptionName\fR on \fIchannel\fR.
The procedure normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.  If an error occurs,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR;  in addition, if \fIinterp\fR is non-NULL,
\fBTcl_SetChannelOption\fR leaves an error message in the interpreter's result.

.SH TCL_EOF
.PP
\fBTcl_Eof\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR encountered
an end of file during the last input operation.

.SH TCL_INPUTBLOCKED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBlocked\fR returns a nonzero value if \fIchannel\fR is in
nonblocking mode and the last input operation returned less data than
requested because there was insufficient data available.
The call always returns zero if the channel is in blocking mode.

.SH TCL_INPUTBUFFERED
.PP
\fBTcl_InputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of input currently
buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open
for reading, this function always returns zero.

.SH TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED
\fBTcl_OutputBuffered\fR returns the number of bytes of output
currently buffered in the internal buffers for a channel. If the
channel is not open for writing, this function always returns zero.

.SH "PLATFORM ISSUES"
.PP
The handles returned from \fBTcl_GetChannelHandle\fR depend on the
platform and the channel type.  On Unix platforms, the handle is
always a Unix file descriptor as returned from the \fBopen\fR system
call.  On Windows platforms, the handle is a file \fBHANDLE\fR when
the channel was created with \fBTcl_OpenFileChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_OpenCommandChannel\fR, or \fBTcl_MakeFileChannel\fR.  Other
channel types may return a different type of handle on Windows
platforms.

Refers to the interpreter the embedded configuration information is
registered for. Must not be NULL.
.AP "const char" *pkgName in
Contains the name of the package registering the embedded
configuration as ASCII string. This means that this information is in
UTF-8 too. Must not be NULL.
.AP Tcl_Config *configuration in
Refers to an array of Tcl_Config entries containing the information
embedded in the binary library. Must not be NULL. The end of the array
is signaled by either a key identical to NULL, or a key referring to
the empty string.
.AP "const char" *valEncoding in
Contains the name of the encoding used to store the configuration

.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The function described here has its base in TIP 59 and provides
extensions with support for the embedding of configuration
information into their binary library and the generation of a
Tcl-level interface for querying this information.
.PP
To embed configuration information into their binary library an
extension has to define a non-volatile array of Tcl_Config entries in
one if its source files and then call \fBTcl_RegisterConfig\fR to
register that information.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterConfig\fR takes four arguments; first, a reference to
the interpreter we are registering the information with, second, the
name of the package registering its configuration information, third,
a pointer to an array of structures, and fourth a string declaring the
encoding used by the configuration values.
.PP
The string \fIvalEncoding\fR contains the name of an encoding known to
Tcl.  All these names are use only characters in the ASCII subset of
UTF-8 and are thus implicitly in the UTF-8 encoding. It is expected
that keys are legible English text and therefore using the ASCII
subset of UTF-8. In other words, they are expected to be in UTF-8
too. The values associated with the keys can be any string
however. For these the contents of \fIvalEncoding\fR define which
encoding was used to represent the characters of the strings.
.PP
Each element of the \fIconfiguration\fR array refers to two strings
containing the key and the value associated with that key. The end of
the array is signaled by either an empty key or a key identical to
NULL. The function makes \fBno\fR copy of the \fIconfiguration\fR
array. This means that the caller has to make sure that the memory
holding this array is never released. This is the meaning behind the
word \fBnon-volatile\fR used earlier. The easiest way to accomplish
this is to define a global static array of Tcl_Config entries. See the file
.QW generic/tclPkgConfig.c
in the sources of the Tcl core for an example.
.PP
When called \fBTcl_RegisterConfig\fR will
.IP (1)
create a namespace having the provided \fIpkgName\fR, if not yet
existing.
.IP (2)
create the command \fBpkgconfig\fR in that namespace and link it to
the provided information so that the keys from _configuration_ and
their associated values can be retrieved through calls to
\fBpkgconfig\fR.
.PP
The command \fBpkgconfig\fR will provide two subcommands, \fBlist\fR
and \fBget\fR:
.RS
.TP
::\fIpkgName\fR::\fBpkgconfig\fR list
Returns a list containing the names of all defined keys.
.TP
::\fIpkgName\fR::\fBpkgconfig\fR get \fIkey\fR
Returns the configuration value associated with the specified
\fIkey\fR.

.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures in this man page manage Tcl object types.
They are used to register new object types, look up types,
and force conversions from one type to another.
.PP
\fBTcl_RegisterObjType\fR registers a new Tcl object type
in the table of all object types that \fBTcl_GetObjType\fR
can look up by name.  There are other object types supported by Tcl
as well, which Tcl chooses not to register.  Extensions can likewise
choose to register the object types they create or not.
The argument \fItypePtr\fR points to a Tcl_ObjType structure that
describes the new type by giving its name
and by supplying pointers to four procedures
that implement the type.
If the type table already contains a type
with the same name as in \fItypePtr\fR,
it is replaced with the new type.
The Tcl_ObjType structure is described
in the section \fBTHE TCL_OBJTYPE STRUCTURE\fR below.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetObjType\fR returns a pointer to the registered Tcl_ObjType
with name \fItypeName\fR.
It returns NULL if no type with that name is registered.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendAllObjTypes\fR appends the name of each registered object type
as a list element onto the Tcl object referenced by \fIobjPtr\fR.
The return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR unless there was an error
converting \fIobjPtr\fR to a list object;
in that case \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_ConvertToType\fR converts an object from one type to another
if possible.
It creates a new internal representation for \fIobjPtr\fR
appropriate for the target type \fItypePtr\fR
and sets its \fItypePtr\fR member as determined by calling the 
\fItypePtr->setFromAnyProc\fR routine.  
Any internal representation for \fIobjPtr\fR's old type is freed.
If an error occurs during conversion, it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
and leaves an error message in the result object for \fIinterp\fR
unless \fIinterp\fR is NULL.
Otherwise, it returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
Passing a NULL \fIinterp\fR allows this procedure to be used
as a test whether the conversion can be done (and in fact was done).
.VS 8.5
.PP
In many cases, the \fItypePtr->setFromAnyProc\fR routine will
set \fIobjPtr->typePtr\fR to the argument value \fItypePtr\fR,
but that is no longer guaranteed.  The \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR is
free to set the internal representation for \fIobjPtr\fR to make
use of another related Tcl_ObjType, if it sees fit.
.VE 8.5
.SH "THE TCL_OBJTYPE STRUCTURE"
.PP
Extension writers can define new object types by defining four
procedures and
initializing a Tcl_ObjType structure to describe the type.
Extension writers may also pass a pointer to their Tcl_ObjType
structure to \fBTcl_RegisterObjType\fR if they wish to permit
other extensions to look up their Tcl_ObjType by name with
the \fBTcl_GetObjType\fR routine.
The \fBTcl_ObjType\fR structure is defined as follows:
.PP
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_ObjType {
    char *\fIname\fR;
    Tcl_FreeInternalRepProc *\fIfreeIntRepProc\fR;
    Tcl_DupInternalRepProc *\fIdupIntRepProc\fR;
    Tcl_UpdateStringProc *\fIupdateStringProc\fR;
    Tcl_SetFromAnyProc *\fIsetFromAnyProc\fR;
} Tcl_ObjType;
.CE
.SS "THE NAME FIELD"
.PP
The \fIname\fR member describes the name of the type, e.g. \fBint\fR.
When a type is registered, this is the name used by callers
of \fBTcl_GetObjType\fR to lookup the type.  For unregistered
types, the \fIname\fR field is primarily of value for debugging.
The remaining four members are pointers to procedures
called by the generic Tcl object code:
.SS "THE SETFROMANYPROC FIELD"
.PP
The \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR member contains the address of a function
called to create a valid internal representation
from an object's string representation.
.PP
.CS
typedef int (Tcl_SetFromAnyProc) (Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
        Tcl_Obj *\fIobjPtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
If an internal representation cannot be created from the string,
it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and puts a message
describing the error in the result object for \fIinterp\fR
unless \fIinterp\fR is NULL.
If \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR is successful,
it stores the new internal representation,
sets \fIobjPtr\fR's \fItypePtr\fR member to point to
the \fBTcl_ObjType\fR struct corresponding to the new
internal representation, and returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
Before setting the new internal representation,
the \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR must free any internal representation
of \fIobjPtr\fR's old type;
it does this by calling the old type's \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR
if it is not NULL.
.PP
As an example, the \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR for the built-in Tcl list type
gets an up-to-date string representation for \fIobjPtr\fR
by calling \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR.
It parses the string to verify it is in a valid list format and
to obtain each element value in the list, and, if this succeeds,
stores the list elements in \fIobjPtr\fR's internal representation
and sets \fIobjPtr\fR's \fItypePtr\fR member to point to the list type's
Tcl_ObjType structure.
.PP
Do not release \fIobjPtr\fR's old internal representation unless you
replace it with a new one or reset the \fItypePtr\fR member to NULL.
.PP
The \fIsetFromAnyProc\fR member may be set to NULL, if the routines
making use of the internal representation have no need to derive that
internal representation from an arbitrary string value.  However, in
this case, passing a pointer to the type to Tcl_ConvertToType() will
lead to a panic, so to avoid this possibility, the type
should \fInot\fR be registered.
.SS "THE UPDATESTRINGPROC FIELD"
.PP
The \fIupdateStringProc\fR member contains the address of a function
called to create a valid string representation
from an object's internal representation.
.PP
.CS
typedef void (Tcl_UpdateStringProc) (Tcl_Obj *\fIobjPtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIobjPtr\fR's \fIbytes\fR member is always NULL when it is called.
It must always set \fIbytes\fR non-NULL before returning.
We require the string representation's byte array
to have a null after the last byte, at offset \fIlength\fR,
and to have no null bytes before that; this allows string representations 
to be treated as conventional null character-terminated C strings.
These restrictions are easily met by using Tcl's internal UTF encoding
for the string representation, same as one would do for other
Tcl routines accepting string values as arguments.
Storage for the byte array must be allocated in the heap by \fBTcl_Alloc\fR
or \fBckalloc\fR.  Note that \fIupdateStringProc\fRs must allocate
enough storage for the string's bytes and the terminating null byte.
.PP
The \fIupdateStringProc\fR for Tcl's built-in double type, for example,
calls Tcl_PrintDouble to write to a buffer of size TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE,
then allocates and copies the string representation to just enough
space to hold it.  A pointer to the allocated space is stored in
the \fIbytes\fR member.
.PP
The \fIupdateStringProc\fR member may be set to NULL, if the routines
making use of the internal representation are written so that the
string representation is never invalidated.  Failure to meet this
obligation will lead to panics or crashes when \fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR
or other similar routines ask for the string representation.
.SS "THE DUPINTREPPROC FIELD"
.PP
The \fIdupIntRepProc\fR member contains the address of a function
called to copy an internal representation from one object to another.
.PP
.CS
typedef void (Tcl_DupInternalRepProc) (Tcl_Obj *\fIsrcPtr\fR,
        Tcl_Obj *\fIdupPtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIdupPtr\fR's internal representation is made a copy of \fIsrcPtr\fR's
internal representation.
Before the call,
\fIsrcPtr\fR's internal representation is valid and \fIdupPtr\fR's is not.
\fIsrcPtr\fR's object type determines what
copying its internal representation means.
.PP
For example, the \fIdupIntRepProc\fR for the Tcl integer type
simply copies an integer.
The built-in list type's \fIdupIntRepProc\fR uses a far more
sophisticated scheme to continue sharing storage as much as it
reasonably can.
.SS "THE FREEINTREPPROC FIELD"
.PP
The \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR member contains the address of a function
that is called when an object is freed.
.PP
.CS
typedef void (Tcl_FreeInternalRepProc) (Tcl_Obj *\fIobjPtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR function can deallocate the storage
for the object's internal representation
and do other type-specific processing necessary when an object is freed.
.PP
For example, the list type's \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR respects
the storage sharing scheme established by the \fIdupIntRepProc\fR
so that it only frees storage when the last object sharing it
is being freed.
.PP
The \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR member can be set to NULL
to indicate that the internal representation does not require freeing.
The \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR implementation must not access the
\fIbytes\fR member of the object, since Tcl makes its own internal
uses of that field during object deletion.  The defined tasks for
the \fIfreeIntRepProc\fR have no need to consult the \fIbytes\fR
member.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These three procedures help implement a simple reference count mechanism
for managing storage.  They are designed to solve a problem
having to do with widget deletion, but are also useful in many other
situations.  When a widget is deleted, its
widget record (the structure holding information specific to the
widget) must be returned to the storage allocator.
However, it is possible that the widget record is in active use
by one of the procedures on the stack at the time of the deletion.
This can happen, for example, if the command associated with a button
widget causes the button to be destroyed:  an X event causes an
event-handling C procedure in the button to be invoked, which in
turn causes the button's associated Tcl command to be executed,
which in turn causes the button to be deleted, which in turn causes
the button's widget record to be de-allocated.
Unfortunately, when the Tcl command returns, the button's
event-handling procedure will need to reference the
button's widget record.
Because of this, the widget record must not be freed as part of the
deletion, but must be retained until the event-handling procedure has
finished with it.
In other situations where the widget is deleted, it may be possible
to free the widget record immediately.
.PP
\fBTcl_Preserve\fR and \fBTcl_Release\fR
implement short-term reference counts for their \fIclientData\fR
argument.
The \fIclientData\fR argument identifies an object and usually
consists of the address of a structure.
The reference counts guarantee that an object will not be freed
until each call to \fBTcl_Preserve\fR for the object has been
matched by calls to \fBTcl_Release\fR.
There may be any number of unmatched \fBTcl_Preserve\fR calls
in effect at once.
.PP
\fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR is invoked to free up its \fIclientData\fR
argument.
It checks to see if there are unmatched \fBTcl_Preserve\fR calls
for the object.
If not, then \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR calls \fIfreeProc\fR immediately.
Otherwise \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR records the fact that \fIclientData\fR
needs eventually to be freed.
When all calls to \fBTcl_Preserve\fR have been matched with
calls to \fBTcl_Release\fR then \fIfreeProc\fR will be called by
\fBTcl_Release\fR to do the cleanup.
.PP
All the work of freeing the object is carried out by \fIfreeProc\fR.
\fIFreeProc\fR must have arguments and result that match the
type \fBTcl_FreeProc\fR:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *\fIblockPtr\fR);
.CE
The \fIblockPtr\fR argument to \fIfreeProc\fR will be the
same as the \fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR.
The type of \fIblockPtr\fR (\fBchar *\fR) is different than the type of the
\fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR for historical
reasons, but the value is the same.
.PP
When the \fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_EventuallyFree\fR
refers to storage allocated and returned by a prior call to
\fBTcl_Alloc\fR, \fBckalloc\fR, or another function of the Tcl library,
then the \fIfreeProc\fR argument should be given the special value of
\fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR.
.PP
This mechanism can be used to solve the problem described above
by placing \fBTcl_Preserve\fR and \fBTcl_Release\fR calls around
actions that may cause undesired storage re-allocation.  The
mechanism is intended only for short-term use (i.e. while procedures
are pending on the stack);  it will not work efficiently as a
mechanism for long-term reference counts.
The implementation does not depend in any way on the internal
structure of the objects being freed;  it keeps the reference
counts in a separate structure.
