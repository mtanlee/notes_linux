n {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
		backwards compatible).
		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
		the index is counted from the end.
		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.

		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
<		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
		see above.

		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.	The matching is always
		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

					*matchadd()* *E798* *E799* *E801*
matchadd({group}, {pattern}[, {priority}[, {id}]])
		Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a
		"match").  It will be highlighted with {group}.  Returns an
		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
		match using |matchdelete()|.
		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.

		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
		match.	A match with a high priority will have its
		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
		always overrule syntax highlighting.

		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified,
		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.

		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
		the |:match| commands.

		Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
<		Deletion of the pattern: >
			:call matchdelete(m)

<		A list of matches defined by |matchadd()| and |:match| are
		available from |getmatches()|.	All matches can be deleted in
		one operation by |clearmatches()|.

matchaddpos({group}, {pos}[, {priority}[, {id}]])		*matchaddpos()*
		Same as |matchadd()|, but requires a list of positions {pos}
		instead of a pattern. This command is faster than |matchadd()|
		because it does not require to handle regular expressions and
		sets buffer line boundaries to redraw screen. It is supposed
		to be used when fast match additions and deletions are
		required, for example to highlight matching parentheses.

		The list {pos} can contain one of these items:
		- A number.  This whole line will be highlighted.  The first
		  line has number 1.
		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
		  number will be highlighted.
		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
		  be highlighted.
		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but
		  the third number gives the length of the highlight in bytes.
		
		The maximum number of positions is 8.

		Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:let m = matchaddpos("MyGroup", [[23, 24], 34])
<		Deletion of the pattern: >
			:call matchdelete(m)

<		Matches added by |matchaddpos()| are returned by
		|getmatches()| with an entry "pos1", "pos2", etc., with the
		value a list like the {pos} item.
		These matches cannot be set via |setmatches()|, however they
		can still be deleted by |clearmatches()|.

matcharg({nr})							*matcharg()*
		Selects the {nr} match item, as set with a |:match|,
		|:2match| or |:3match| command.
		Return a |List| with two elements:
			The name of the highlight group used
			The pattern used.
		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].
		This is useful to save and restore a |:match|.
		Highlighting matches using the |:match| commands are limited
		to three matches. |matchadd()| does not have this limitation.

matchdelete({id})			       *matchdelete()* *E802* *E803*
		Deletes a match with ID {id} previously defined by |matchadd()|
		or one of the |:match| commands.  Returns 0 if successful,
		otherwise -1.  See example for |matchadd()|.  All matches can
		be deleted in one operation by |clearmatches()|.

matchend({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchend()*
		Same as |match()|, but return the index of first character
		after the match.  Example: >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing")
<		results in "7".
							*strspn()* *strcspn()*
		Vim doesn't have a strspn() or strcspn() function, but you can
		do it with matchend(): >
			:let span = matchend(line, '[a-zA-Z]')
			:let span = matchend(line, '[^a-zA-Z]')
<		Except that -1 is returned when there are no matches.

		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing", 2)
<		results in "7". >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing", 5)
<		result is "-1".
		When {expr} is a |List| the result is equal to |match()|.

matchlist({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchlist()*
		Same as |match()|, but return a |List|.  The first item in the
		list is the matched string, same as what matchstr() would
		return.  Following items are submatches, like "\1", "\2", etc.
		in |:substitute|.  When an optional submatch didn't match an
		empty string is used.  Example: >
			echo matchlist('acd', '\(a\)\?\(b\)\?\(c\)\?\(.*\)')
<		Results in: ['acd', 'a', '', 'c', 'd', '', '', '', '', '']
		When there is no match an empty list is returned.

matchstr({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchstr()*
		Same as |match()|, but return the matched string.  Example: >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing")
<		results in "ing".
		When there is no match "" is returned.
		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 2)
<		results in "ing". >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 5)
<		result is "".
		When {expr} is a |List| then the matching item is returned.
		The type isn't changed, it's not necessarily a String.

							*max()*
max({list})	Return the maximum value of all items in {list}.
		If {list} is not a list or one of the items in {list} cannot
		be used as a Number this results in an error.
		An empty |List| results in zero.

							*min()*
min({list})	Return the minimum value of all items in {list}.
		If {list} is not a list or one of the items in {list} cannot
		be used as a Number this results in an error.
		An empty |List| results in zero.

							*mkdir()* *E739*
mkdir({name} [, {path} [, {prot}]])
		Create directory {name}.
		If {path} is "p" then intermediate directories are created as
		necessary.  Otherwise it must be "".
		If {prot} is given it is used to set the protection bits of
		the new directory.  The default is 0755 (rwxr-xr-x: r/w for
		the user readable for others).	Use 0700 to make it unreadable
		for others.  This is only used for the last part of {name}.
		Thus if you create /tmp/foo/bar then /tmp/foo will be created
		with 0755.
		Example: >
			:call mkdir($HOME . "/tmp/foo/bar", "p", 0700)
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		Not available on all systems.  To check use: >
			:if exists("*mkdir")
<
							*mode()*
mode([expr])	Return a string that indicates the current mode.
		If [expr] is supplied and it evaluates to a non-zero Number or
		a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then the full mode is
		returned, otherwise only the first letter is returned.  Note
		that " " and "0" are also non-empty strings.

			n	Normal
			no	Operator-pending
			v	Visual by character
			V	Visual by line
			CTRL-V	Visual blockwise
			s	Select by character
			S	Select by line
			CTRL-S	Select blockwise
			i	Insert
			R	Replace |R|
			Rv	Virtual Replace |gR|
			c	Command-line
			cv	Vim Ex mode |gQ|
			ce	Normal Ex mode |Q|
			r	Hit-enter prompt
			rm	The -- more -- prompt
			r?	A |:confirm| query of some sort
			!	Shell or external command is executing
		This is useful in the 'statusline' option or when used
		with |remote_expr()| In most other places it always returns
		"c" or "n".
		Also see |visualmode()|.

mzeval({expr})							*mzeval()*
		Evaluate MzScheme expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are.
		Pairs (including lists and improper lists) and vectors are
		returned as Vim |Lists|.
		Hash tables are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type with keys
		converted to strings.
		All other types are converted to string with display function.
		Examples: >
		    :mz (define l (list 1 2 3))
		    :mz (define h (make-hash)) (hash-set! h "list" l)
		    :echo mzeval("l")
		    :echo mzeval("h")
<
		{only available when compiled with the |+mzscheme| feature}

nextnonblank({lnum})					*nextnonblank()*
		Return the line number of the first line at or below {lnum}
		that is not blank.  Example: >
			if getline(nextnonblank(1)) =~ "Java"
<		When {lnum} is invalid or there is no non-blank line at or
		below it, zero is returned.
		See also |prevnonblank()|.

nr2char({expr}[, {utf8}])				*nr2char()*
		Return a string with a single character, which has the number
		value {expr}.  Examples: >
			nr2char(64)		returns "@"
			nr2char(32)		returns " "
<		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.
		Example for "utf-8": >
			nr2char(300)		returns I with bow character
<		With {utf8} set to 1, always return utf-8 characters.
		Note that a NUL character in the file is specified with
		nr2char(10), because NULs are represented with newline
		characters.  nr2char(0) is a real NUL and terminates the
		string, thus results in an empty string.

or({expr}, {expr})					*or()*
		Bitwise OR on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let bits = or(bits, 0x80)


pathshorten({expr})					*pathshorten()*
		Shorten directory names in the path {expr} and return the
		result.  The tail, the file name, is kept as-is.  The other
		components in the path are reduced to single letters.  Leading
		'~' and '.' characters are kept.  Example: >
			:echo pathshorten('~/.vim/autoload/myfile.vim')
<			~/.v/a/myfile.vim ~
		It doesn't matter if the path exists or not.

pow({x}, {y})						*pow()*
		Return the power of {x} to the exponent {y} as a |Float|.
		{x} and {y} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo pow(3, 3)
<			27.0 >
			:echo pow(2, 16)
<			65536.0 >
			:echo pow(32, 0.20)
<			2.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		
prevnonblank({lnum})					*prevnonblank()*
		Return the line number of the first line at or above {lnum}
		that is not blank.  Example: >
			let ind = indent(prevnonblank(v:lnum - 1))
<		When {lnum} is invalid or there is no non-blank line at or
		above it, zero is returned.
		Also see |nextnonblank()|.


printf({fmt}, {expr1} ...)				*printf()*
		Return a String with {fmt}, where "%" items are replaced by
		the formatted form of their respective arguments.  Example: >
			printf("%4d: E%d %.30s", lnum, errno, msg)
<		May result in:
			"  99: E42 asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas" ~

		Often used items are:
		  %s	string
		  %6S	string right-aligned in 6 display cells
		  %6s	string right-aligned in 6 bytes
		  %.9s	string truncated to 9 bytes
		  %c	single byte
		  %d	decimal number
		  %5d	decimal number padded with spaces to 5 characters
		  %x	hex number
		  %04x	hex number padded with zeros to at least 4 characters
		  %X	hex number using upper case letters
		  %o	octal number
		  %f	floating point number in the form 123.456
		  %e	floating point number in the form 1.234e3
		  %E	floating point number in the form 1.234E3
		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
		  %G	floating point number, as %f or %E depending on value
		  %%	the % character itself

		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
		the result.

		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
		arguments appear in sequence:

			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type

		flags
			Zero or more of the following flags:

		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
			      of the number is increased to force the first
			      character of the output string to a zero (except
			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
			      precision of zero).
			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
			      prepended to it.

		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
			      is ignored.

		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
			      The converted value is padded on the right with
			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.

		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).

		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
			      produced by a signed conversion.	A + overrides
			      a space if both are used.

		field-width
			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
			been given) to fill out the field width.

		.precision
			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
			For floating point it is the number of digits after
			the decimal point.

		type
			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
			be applied, see below.

		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.	A
		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
<		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
		"width" bytes.

		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

				*printf-d* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
		doxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal
			(d), unsigned octal (o), or unsigned hexadecimal (x
			and X) notation.  The letters "abcdef" are used for
			x conversions; the letters "ABCDEF" are used for X
			conversions.
			The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
			digits that must appear; if the converted value
			requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with
			zeros.
			In no case does a non-existent or small field width
			cause truncation of a numeric field; if the result of
			a conversion is wider than the field width, the field
			is expanded to contain the conversion result.

							*printf-c*
		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
			resulting character is written.

							*printf-s*
		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
			specified are used.
		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
			number specified are used.  Without the |+multi_byte|
			feature works just like 's'.

							*printf-f* *E807*
		f	The Float argument is converted into a string of the 
			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf".
			"0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan".
			Example: >
				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
<				12.12
			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
			Use |round()| when in doubt.

							*printf-e* *printf-E*
		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
			precision specifies the number of digits after the
			decimal point, like with 'f'.

							*printf-g* *printf-G*
		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
			results in 1.0e7.

							*printf-%*
		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
			complete conversion specification is "%%".

		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
		accepted and automatically converted.
		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
		is also accepted and automatically converted.
		Any other argument type results in an error message.

							*E766* *E767*
		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.


pumvisible()						*pumvisible()*
		Returns non-zero when the popup menu is visible, zero
		otherwise.  See |ins-completion-menu|.
		This can be used to avoid some things that would remove the
		popup menu.

							*E860*
py3eval({expr})						*py3eval()*
		Evaluate Python expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are (strings are 
		copied though, unicode strings are additionally converted to 
		'encoding').
		Lists are represented as Vim |List| type.
		Dictionaries are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type with 
		keys converted to strings.
		{only available when compiled with the |+python3| feature}

							*E858* *E859*
pyeval({expr})						*pyeval()*
		Evaluate Python expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are (strings are 
		copied though).
		Lists are represented as Vim |List| type.
		Dictionaries are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type, 
		non-string keys result in error.
		{only available when compiled with the |+python| feature}

							*E726* *E727*
range({expr} [, {max} [, {stride}]])				*range()*
		Returns a |List| with Numbers:
		- If only {expr} is specified: [0, 1, ..., {expr} - 1]
		- If {max} is specified: [{expr}, {expr} + 1, ..., {max}]
		- If {stride} is specified: [{expr}, {expr} + {stride}, ...,
		  {max}] (increasing {expr} with {stride} each time, not
		  producing a value past {max}).
		When the maximum is one before the start the result is an
		empty list.  When the maximum is more than one before the
		start this is an error.
		Examples: >
			range(4)		" [0, 1, 2, 3]
			range(2, 4)		" [2, 3, 4]
			range(2, 9, 3)		" [2, 5, 8]
			range(2, -2, -1)	" [2, 1, 0, -1, -2]
			range(0)		" []
			range(2, 0)		" error!
<
							*readfile()*
readfile({fname} [, {binary} [, {max}]])
		Read file {fname} and return a |List|, each line of the file
		as an item.  Lines broken at NL characters.  Macintosh files
		separated with CR will result in a single long line (unless a
		NL appears somewhere).
		All NUL characters are replaced with a NL character.
		When {binary} is equal to "b" binary mode is used:
		- When the last line ends in a NL an extra empty list item is
		  added.
		- No CR characters are removed.
		Otherwise:
		- CR characters that appear before a NL are removed.
		- Whether the last line ends in a NL or not does not matter.
		- When 'encoding' is Unicode any UTF-8 byte order mark is
		  removed from the text.
		When {max} is given this specifies the maximum number of lines
		to be read.  Useful if you only want to check the first ten
		lines of a file: >
			:for line in readfile(fname, '', 10)
			:  if line =~ 'Date' | echo line | endif
			:endfor
<		When {max} is negative -{max} lines from the end of the file
		are returned, or as many as there are.
		When {max} is zero the result is an empty list.
		Note that without {max} the whole file is read into memory.
		Also note that there is no recognition of encoding.  Read a
		file into a buffer if you need to.
		When the file can't be opened an error message is given and
		the result is an empty list.
		Also see |writefile()|.

reltime([{start} [, {end}]])				*reltime()*
		Return an item that represents a time value.  The format of
		the item depends on the system.  It can be passed to
		|reltimestr()| to convert it to a string.
		Without an argument it returns the current time.
		With one argument is returns the time passed since the time
		specified in the argument.
		With two arguments it returns the time passed between {start}
		and {end}.
		The {start} and {end} arguments must be values returned by
		reltime().
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

reltimestr({time})				*reltimestr()*
		Return a String that represents the time value of {time}.
		This is the number of seconds, a dot and the number of
		microseconds.  Example: >
			let start = reltime()
			call MyFunction()
			echo reltimestr(reltime(start))
<		Note that overhead for the commands will be added to the time.
		The accuracy depends on the system.
		Leading spaces are used to make the string align nicely.  You
		can use split() to remove it. >
			echo split(reltimestr(reltime(start)))[0]
<		Also see |profiling|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

							*remote_expr()* *E449*
remote_expr({server}, {string} [, {idvar}])
		Send the {string} to {server}.	The string is sent as an
		expression and the result is returned after evaluation.
		The result must be a String or a |List|.  A |List| is turned
		into a String by joining the items with a line break in
		between (not at the end), like with join(expr, "\n").
		If {idvar} is present, it is taken as the name of a
		variable and a {serverid} for later use with
		remote_read() is stored there.
		See also |clientserver| |RemoteReply|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Note: Any errors will cause a local error message to be issued
		and the result will be the empty string.
		Examples: >
			:echo remote_expr("gvim", "2+2")
			:echo remote_expr("gvim1", "b:current_syntax")
<

remote_foreground({server})				*remote_foreground()*
		Move the Vim server with the name {server} to the foreground.
		This works like: >
			remote_expr({server}, "foreground()")
<		Except that on Win32 systems the client does the work, to work
		around the problem that the OS doesn't always allow the server
		to bring itself to the foreground.
		Note: This does not restore the window if it was minimized,
		like foreground() does.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only in the Win32, Athena, Motif and GTK GUI versions and the
		Win32 console version}


remote_peek({serverid} [, {retvar}])		*remote_peek()*
		Returns a positive number if there are available strings
		from {serverid}.  Copies any reply string into the variable
		{retvar} if specified.	{retvar} must be a string with the
		name of a variable.
		Returns zero if none are available.
		Returns -1 if something is wrong.
		See also |clientserver|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Examples: >
			:let repl = ""
			:echo "PEEK: ".remote_peek(id, "repl").": ".repl

remote_read({serverid})				*remote_read()*
		Return the oldest available reply from {serverid} and consume

							*remote_send()* *E241*
remote_send({server}, {string} [, {idvar}])
		Send the {string} to {server}.	The string is sent as input
		keys and the function returns immediately.  At the Vim server
		the keys are not mapped |:map|.
		If {idvar} is present, it is taken as the name of a variable
		and a {serverid} for later use with remote_read() is stored
		there.

<
remove({list}, {idx} [, {end}])				*remove()*
		Without {end}: Remove the item at {idx} from |List| {list} and
		return the item.
		With {end}: Remove items from {idx} to {end} (inclusive) and
		return a List with these items.  When {idx} points to the same
		item as {end} a list with one item is returned.  When {end}
		points to an item before {idx} this is an error.
		See |list-index| for possible values of {idx} and {end}.
		Example: >
			:echo "last item: " . remove(mylist, -1)
			:call remove(mylist, 0, 9)
remove({dict}, {key})
		Remove the entry from {dict} with key {key}.  Example: >
			:echo "removed " . remove(dict, "one")
<		If there is no {key} in {dict} this is an error.

		Use |delete()| to remove a file.

rename({from}, {to})					*rename()*
		Rename the file by the name {from} to the name {to}.  This
		should also work to move files across file systems.  The
		result is a Number, which is 0 if the file was renamed
		successfully, and non-zero when the renaming failed.
		NOTE: If {to} exists it is overwritten without warning.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

repeat({expr}, {count})					*repeat()*
		Repeat {expr} {count} times and return the concatenated
		result.  Example: >
			:let separator = repeat('-', 80)
<		When {count} is zero or negative the result is empty.
		When {expr} is a |List| the result is {expr} concatenated
		{count} times.	Example: >
			:let longlist = repeat(['a', 'b'], 3)
<		Results in ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b'].


resolve({filename})					*resolve()* *E655*
		On MS-Windows, when {filename} is a shortcut (a .lnk file),
		returns the path the shortcut points to in a simplified form.
		On Unix, repeat resolving symbolic links in all path
		components of {filename} and return the simplified result.
		To cope with link cycles, resolving of symbolic links is
		stopped after 100 iterations.
		On other systems, return the simplified {filename}.
		The simplification step is done as by |simplify()|.
		resolve() keeps a leading path component specifying the
		current directory (provided the result is still a relative
		path name) and also keeps a trailing path separator.

							*reverse()*
reverse({list})	Reverse the order of items in {list} in-place.	Returns
		{list}.
		If you want a list to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let revlist = reverse(copy(mylist))

round({expr})							*round()*
		Round off {expr} to the nearest integral value and return it
		as a |Float|.  If {expr} lies halfway between two integral
		values, then use the larger one (away from zero).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo round(0.456)
<			0.0  >
			echo round(4.5)
<			5.0 >
			echo round(-4.5)
<			-5.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}

screenattr(row, col)						*screenattr()*
		Like screenchar(), but return the attribute.  This is a rather
		arbitrary number that can only be used to compare to the
		attribute at other positions.

screenchar(row, col)						*screenchar()*
		The result is a Number, which is the character at position
		[row, col] on the screen.  This works for every possible
		screen position, also status lines, window separators and the
		command line.  The top left position is row one, column one
		The character excludes composing characters.  For double-byte
		encodings it may only be the first byte.
		This is mainly to be used for testing.
		Returns -1 when row or col is out of range.

screencol()							*screencol()*
		The result is a Number, which is the current screen column of
		the cursor. The leftmost column has number 1.
		This function is mainly used for testing.

		Note: Always returns the current screen column, thus if used
		in a command (e.g. ":echo screencol()") it will return the
		column inside the command line, which is 1 when the command is
		executed. To get the cursor position in the file use one of
		the following mappings: >
			nnoremap <expr> GG ":echom ".screencol()."\n"
			nnoremap <silent> GG :echom screencol()<CR>
<
screenrow()							*screenrow()*
		The result is a Number, which is the current screen row of the
		cursor.  The top line has number one.
		This function is mainly used for testing.

		Note: Same restrictions as with |screencol()|.

search({pattern} [, {flags} [, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]])	*search()*
		Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the
		cursor position (you can use |cursor()| to set it).

		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
		move.  No error message is given.

		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
		'b'	search backward instead of forward
		'c'	accept a match at the cursor position
		'e'	move to the End of the match
		'n'	do Not move the cursor
		'p'	return number of matching sub-pattern (see below)
		's'	set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
		'w'	wrap around the end of the file
		'W'	don't wrap around the end of the file
		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.

		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
		flag.

		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.

		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
<		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.

		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
		more than this many milliseconds have passed.	Thus when
		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
		giving the argument.
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

							*search()-sub-match*
		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
		whole pattern did match.
		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.

		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
		flag is used.

		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
		    :let n = 1
		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
		    :  exe "argument " . n
		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
		    :  normal G$
		    :  let flags = "w"
		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
		    :	 let flags = "W"
		    :  endwhile
		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
		    :  let n = n + 1
		    :endwhile
<
		Example for using some flags: >
		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
<		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
		line:
		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.


searchdecl({name} [, {global} [, {thisblock}]])			*searchdecl()*
		Search for the declaration of {name}.

		With a non-zero {global} argument it works like |gD|, find
		first match in the file.  Otherwise it works like |gd|, find
		first match in the function.

		With a non-zero {thisblock} argument matches in a {} block
		that ends before the cursor position are ignored.  Avoids
		finding variable declarations only valid in another scope.

		Moves the cursor to the found match.
		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
		Example: >
			if searchdecl('myvar') == 0
			   echo getline('.')
			endif
<
							*searchpair()*
searchpair({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
		Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
		used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
		if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
		The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
		forward, include 'b' in {flags} to search backward.
		If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
		line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
		returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
		given.

		{start}, {middle} and {end} are patterns, see |pattern|.  They
		must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
		{middle} is not empty, it is found when searching from either
		direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
		typical use is: >
			searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
<		By leaving {middle} empty the "else" is skipped.

		{flags} 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
		|search()|.  Additionally:
		'r'	Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
			outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
		'm'	Return number of matches instead of line number with
			the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
		Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
		avoid wrapping around the end of the file.

		When a match for {start}, {middle} or {end} is found, the
		{skip} expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
		the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
		match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
		or a string.
		When {skip} is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
		When evaluating {skip} causes an error the search is aborted
		and -1 returned.

		For {stopline} and {timeout} see |search()|.

		The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
		patterns are used like it's on.

		The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
		{start}, {middle} or {end} at the next character, in the
		direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example: >
			if 1
			  if 2
			  endif 2
			endif 1
<		When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
		searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
		the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
		found.	That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
		then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
		"endif 2".
		When searching backwards and {end} is more than one character,
		it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
		that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
		the matching start.

		Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script: >

	:echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
			\ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')

<		The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
		to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
		having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
		catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
		Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway a line is considered a
		match.
		Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}": >

	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')

<		This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
		match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
		highlighting recognized as strings: >

	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
	     \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
<
							*searchpairpos()*
searchpairpos({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
		Same as |searchpair()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
		the column position of the match.  If no match is found,
		returns [0, 0]. >

			:let [lnum,col] = searchpairpos('{', '', '}', 'n')
<
		See |match-parens| for a bigger and more useful example.

searchpos({pattern} [, {flags} [, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]])	*searchpos()*
		Same as |search()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
		the column position of the match. If no match is found,
		returns [0, 0].
		Example: >
	:let [lnum, col] = searchpos('mypattern', 'n')

<		When the 'p' flag is given then there is an extra item with
		the sub-pattern match number |search()-sub-match|.  Example: >
	:let [lnum, col, submatch] = searchpos('\(\l\)\|\(\u\)', 'np')
<		In this example "submatch" is 2 when a lowercase letter is
		found |/\l|, 3 when an uppercase letter is found |/\u|.

server2client( {clientid}, {string})			*server2client()*
		Send a reply string to {clientid}.  The most recent {clientid}
		that sent a string can be retrieved with expand("<client>").
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Note:
		This id has to be stored before the next command can be
		received.  I.e. before returning from the received command and
		before calling any commands that waits for input.
		See also |clientserver|.
		Example: >
			:echo server2client(expand("<client>"), "HELLO")
<
serverlist()					*serverlist()*
		Return a list of available server names, one per line.
		When there are no servers or the information is not available
		an empty string is returned.  See also |clientserver|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Example: >
			:echo serverlist()
<
setbufvar({expr}, {varname}, {val})			*setbufvar()*
		Set option or local variable {varname} in buffer {expr} to
		{val}.
		This also works for a global or local window option, but it
		doesn't work for a global or local window variable.
		For a local window option the global value is unchanged.
		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
		Note that the variable name without "b:" must be used.
		Examples: >
			:call setbufvar(1, "&mod", 1)
			:call setbufvar("todo", "myvar", "foobar")
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

setcmdpos({pos})					*setcmdpos()*
		Set the cursor position in the command line to byte position
		{pos}.	The first position is 1.
		Use |getcmdpos()| to obtain the current position.
		Only works while editing the command line, thus you must use
		|c_CTRL-\_e|, |c_CTRL-R_=| or |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R| with '='.  For
		|c_CTRL-\_e| and |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R| with '=' the position is
		set after the command line is set to the expression.  For
		|c_CTRL-R_=| it is set after evaluating the expression but
		before inserting the resulting text.
		When the number is too big the cursor is put at the end of the
		line.  A number smaller than one has undefined results.
		Returns 0 when successful, 1 when not editing the command
		line.

setline({lnum}, {text})					*setline()*
		Set line {lnum} of the current buffer to {text}.  To insert
		lines use |append()|.
		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.
		When {lnum} is just below the last line the {text} will be
		added as a new line.
		If this succeeds, 0 is returned.  If this fails (most likely
		because {lnum} is invalid) 1 is returned.  Example: >
			:call setline(5, strftime("%c"))
<		When {text} is a |List| then line {lnum} and following lines
		will be set to the items in the list.  Example: >
			:call setline(5, ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'])
<		This is equivalent to: >
			:for [n, l] in [[5, 'aaa'], [6, 'bbb'], [7, 'ccc']]
			:  call setline(n, l)
			:endfor
<		Note: The '[ and '] marks are not set.

setloclist({nr}, {list} [, {action}])			*setloclist()*
		Create or replace or add to the location list for window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero the current window is used. For a location
		list window, the displayed location list is modified.  For an
		invalid window number {nr}, -1 is returned.
		Otherwise, same as |setqflist()|.
		Also see |location-list|.

setmatches({list})					*setmatches()*
		Restores a list of matches saved by |getmatches()|.  Returns 0
		if successful, otherwise -1.  All current matches are cleared
		before the list is restored.  See example for |getmatches()|.

							*setpos()*
setpos({expr}, {list})
		Set the position for {expr}.  Possible values:
			.	the cursor
			'x	mark x

		{list} must be a |List| with four or five numbers:
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off]
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]

		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the
		current buffer.  Setting the cursor is only possible for
		the current buffer.  To set a mark in another buffer you can
		use the |bufnr()| function to turn a file name into a buffer
		number.
		Does not change the jumplist.

		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.

		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
		character.

		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
		mark position it is not used.

		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
		before '>.

		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.

		Also see |getpos()| and |getcurpos()|.

		This does not restore the preferred column for moving
		vertically; if you set the cursor position with this, |j| and
		|k| motions will jump to previous columns!  Use |cursor()| to
		also set the preferred column.  Also see the "curswant" key in
		|winrestview()|.


setqflist({list} [, {action}])				*setqflist()*
		Create or replace or add to the quickfix list using the items
		in {list}.  Each item in {list} is a dictionary.
		Non-dictionary items in {list} are ignored.  Each dictionary
		item can contain the following entries:

		    bufnr	buffer number; must be the number of a valid
				buffer
		    filename	name of a file; only used when "bufnr" is not
				present or it is invalid.
		    lnum	line number in the file
		    pattern	search pattern used to locate the error
		    col		column number
		    vcol	when non-zero: "col" is visual column
				when zero: "col" is byte index
		    nr		error number
		    text	description of the error
		    type	single-character error type, 'E', 'W', etc.

		The "col", "vcol", "nr", "type" and "text" entries are
		optional.  Either "lnum" or "pattern" entry can be used to
		locate a matching error line.
		If the "filename" and "bufnr" entries are not present or
		neither the "lnum" or "pattern" entries are present, then the
		item will not be handled as an error line.
		If both "pattern" and "lnum" are present then "pattern" will
		be used.
		If you supply an empty {list}, the quickfix list will be
		cleared.
		Note that the list is not exactly the same as what
		|getqflist()| returns.

		If {action} is set to 'a', then the items from {list} are
		added to the existing quickfix list. If there is no existing
		list, then a new list is created. If {action} is set to 'r',
		then the items from the current quickfix list are replaced
		with the items from {list}. If {action} is not present or is
		set to ' ', then a new list is created.

		Returns zero for success, -1 for failure.

		This function can be used to create a quickfix list
		independent of the 'errorformat' setting.  Use a command like
		":cc 1" to jump to the first position.


							*setreg()*
setreg({regname}, {value} [,{options}])
		Set the register {regname} to {value}.
		{value} may be any value returned by |getreg()|, including 
		a |List|.
		If {options} contains "a" or {regname} is upper case,
		then the value is appended.
		{options} can also contain a register type specification:
		    "c" or "v"	      |characterwise| mode
		    "l" or "V"	      |linewise| mode
		    "b" or "<CTRL-V>" |blockwise-visual| mode
		If a number immediately follows "b" or "<CTRL-V>" then this is
		used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
		then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
		in the longest line (counting a <Tab> as 1 character).

		If {options} contains no register settings, then the default
		is to use character mode unless {value} ends in a <NL> for 
		string {value} and linewise mode for list {value}. Blockwise 
		mode is never selected automatically.
		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.

							*E883*
		Note: you may not use |List| containing more than one item to 
		      set search and expression registers. Lists containing no 
		      items act like empty strings.

		Examples: >
			:call setreg(v:register, @*)
			:call setreg('*', @%, 'ac')
			:call setreg('a', "1\n2\n3", 'b5')

<		This example shows using the functions to save and restore a
		register (note: you may not reliably restore register value 
		without using the third argument to |getreg()| as without it 
		newlines are represented as newlines AND Nul bytes are 
		represented as newlines as well, see |NL-used-for-Nul|). >
			:let var_a = getreg('a', 1, 1)
			:let var_amode = getregtype('a')
			    ....
			:call setreg('a', var_a, var_amode)

<		You can also change the type of a register by appending
		nothing: >
			:call setreg('a', '', 'al')

settabvar({tabnr}, {varname}, {val})			*settabvar()*
		Set tab-local variable {varname} to {val} in tab page {tabnr}.
		|t:var|
		Note that the variable name without "t:" must be used.
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

settabwinvar({tabnr}, {winnr}, {varname}, {val})	*settabwinvar()*
		Set option or local variable {varname} in window {winnr} to
		{val}.
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.  For the current tabpage
		use |setwinvar()|.
		When {winnr} is zero the current window is used.
		This also works for a global or local buffer option, but it
		doesn't work for a global or local buffer variable.
		For a local buffer option the global value is unchanged.
		Note that the variable name without "w:" must be used.
		Examples: >
			:call settabwinvar(1, 1, "&list", 0)
			:call settabwinvar(3, 2, "myvar", "foobar")
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

setwinvar({nr}, {varname}, {val})			*setwinvar()*
		Like |settabwinvar()| for the current tab page.
		Examples: >
			:call setwinvar(1, "&list", 0)
			:call setwinvar(2, "myvar", "foobar")

sha256({string})						*sha256()*
		Returns a String with 64 hex charactes, which is the SHA256
		checksum of {string}.
		{only available when compiled with the |+cryptv| feature}

shellescape({string} [, {special}])			*shellescape()*
		Escape {string} for use as a shell command argument.
		On MS-Windows and MS-DOS, when 'shellslash' is not set, it
		will enclose {string} in double quotes and double all double
		quotes within {string}.
		For other systems, it will enclose {string} in single quotes
		and replace all "'" with "'\''".
		When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero
		Number or a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then special
		items such as "!", "%", "#" and "<cword>" will be preceded by
		a backslash.  This backslash will be removed again by the |:!|
		command.
		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|
		{special}) when 'shell' contains "csh" in the tail.  That is
		because for csh and tcsh "!" is used for history replacement
		even when inside single quotes.
		The <NL> character is also escaped.  With a |non-zero-arg|
		{special} and 'shell' containing "csh" in the tail it's
		escaped a second time.
		Example of use with a |:!| command: >
		    :exe '!dir ' . shellescape(expand('<cfile>'), 1)
<		This results in a directory listing for the file under the
		cursor.  Example of use with |system()|: >
		    :call system("chmod +w -- " . shellescape(expand("%")))
<		See also |::S|.


shiftwidth()						*shiftwidth()*
		Returns the effective value of 'shiftwidth'. This is the
		'shiftwidth' value unless it is zero, in which case it is the
		'tabstop' value.  To be backwards compatible in indent
		plugins, use this: >
			if exists('*shiftwidth')
			  func s:sw()
			    return shiftwidth()
			  endfunc
			else
			  func s:sw()
			    return &sw
			  endfunc
			endif
<		And then use s:sw() instead of &sw.


simplify({filename})					*simplify()*
		Simplify the file name as much as possible without changing
		the meaning.  Shortcuts (on MS-Windows) or symbolic links (on
		Unix) are not resolved.  If the first path component in
		{filename} designates the current directory, this will be
		valid for the result as well.  A trailing path separator is
		not removed either.
		Example: >
			simplify("./dir/.././/file/") == "./file/"
<		Note: The combination "dir/.." is only removed if "dir" is
		a searchable directory or does not exist.  On Unix, it is also
		removed when "dir" is a symbolic link within the same
		directory.  In order to resolve all the involved symbolic
		links before simplifying the path name, use |resolve()|.


sin({expr})						*sin()*
		Return the sine of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo sin(100)
<			-0.506366 >
			:echo sin(-4.01)
<			0.763301
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		

sinh({expr})						*sinh()*
		Return the hyperbolic sine of {expr} as a |Float| in the range
		[-inf, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo sinh(0.5)
<			0.521095 >
			:echo sinh(-0.9)
<			-1.026517
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


sort({list} [, {func} [, {dict}]])			*sort()* *E702*
		Sort the items in {list} in-place.  Returns {list}.
		
		If you want a list to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let sortedlist = sort(copy(mylist))

<		When {func} is omitted, is empty or zero, then sort() uses the
		string representation of each item to sort on.  Numbers sort
		after Strings, |Lists| after Numbers.  For sorting text in the
		current buffer use |:sort|.

		When {func} is given and it is '1' or 'i' then case is
		ignored.
		
		When {func} is given and it is 'n' then all items will be
		sorted numerical (Implementation detail: This uses the
		strtod() function to parse numbers, Strings, Lists, Dicts and
		Funcrefs will be considered as being 0).

		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function
		is called to compare items.  The function is invoked with two
		items as argument and must return zero if they are equal, 1 or
		bigger if the first one sorts after the second one, -1 or
		smaller if the first one sorts before the second one.

		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|

		The sort is stable, items which compare equal (as number or as
		string) will keep their relative position. E.g., when sorting
		on numbers, text strings will sort next to each other, in the
		same order as they were originally.

		Also see |uniq()|.

		Example: >
			func MyCompare(i1, i2)
			   return a:i1 == a:i2 ? 0 : a:i1 > a:i2 ? 1 : -1
			endfunc
			let sortedlist = sort(mylist, "MyCompare")
<		A shorter compare version for this specific simple case, which
		ignores overflow: >
			func MyCompare(i1, i2)
			   return a:i1 - a:i2
			endfunc
<
							*soundfold()*
soundfold({word})
		Return the sound-folded equivalent of {word}.  Uses the first
		language in 'spelllang' for the current window that supports
		soundfolding.  'spell' must be set.  When no sound folding is
		possible the {word} is returned unmodified.
		This can be used for making spelling suggestions.  Note that
		the method can be quite slow.

							*spellbadword()*
spellbadword([{sentence}])
		Without argument: The result is the badly spelled word under
		or after the cursor.  The cursor is moved to the start of the
		bad word.  When no bad word is found in the cursor line the
		result is an empty string and the cursor doesn't move.

		With argument: The result is the first word in {sentence} that
		is badly spelled.  If there are no spelling mistakes the
		result is an empty string.

		The return value is a list with two items:
		- The badly spelled word or an empty string.
		- The type of the spelling error:
			"bad"		spelling mistake
			"rare"		rare word
			"local"		word only valid in another region
			"caps"		word should start with Capital
		Example: >
			echo spellbadword("the quik brown fox")
<			['quik', 'bad'] ~

		The spelling information for the current window is used.  The
		'spell' option must be set and the value of 'spelllang' is
		used.

							*spellsuggest()*
spellsuggest({word} [, {max} [, {capital}]])
		Return a |List| with spelling suggestions to replace {word}.
		When {max} is given up to this number of suggestions are
		returned.  Otherwise up to 25 suggestions are returned.

		When the {capital} argument is given and it's non-zero only
		suggestions with a leading capital will be given.  Use this
		after a match with 'spellcapcheck'.

		{word} can be a badly spelled word followed by other text.
		This allows for joining two words that were split.  The
		suggestions also include the following text, thus you can
		replace a line.

		{word} may also be a good word.  Similar words will then be
		returned.  {word} itself is not included in the suggestions,
		although it may appear capitalized.

		The spelling information for the current window is used.  The
		'spell' option must be set and the values of 'spelllang' and
		'spellsuggest' are used.


split({expr} [, {pattern} [, {keepempty}]])			*split()*
		Make a |List| out of {expr}.  When {pattern} is omitted or
		empty each white-separated sequence of characters becomes an
		item.
		Otherwise the string is split where {pattern} matches,
		removing the matched characters. 'ignorecase' is not used
		here, add \c to ignore case. |/\c|
		When the first or last item is empty it is omitted, unless the
		{keepempty} argument is given and it's non-zero.
		Other empty items are kept when {pattern} matches at least one
		character or when {keepempty} is non-zero.
		Example: >
			:let words = split(getline('.'), '\W\+')
<		To split a string in individual characters: >
			:for c in split(mystring, '\zs')
<		If you want to keep the separator you can also use '\zs': >
			:echo split('abc:def:ghi', ':\zs')
<			['abc:', 'def:', 'ghi'] ~
		Splitting a table where the first element can be empty: >
			:let items = split(line, ':', 1)
<		The opposite function is |join()|.


sqrt({expr})						*sqrt()*
		Return the non-negative square root of Float {expr} as a
		|Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.  When {expr}
		is negative the result is NaN (Not a Number).
		Examples: >
			:echo sqrt(100)
<			10.0 >
			:echo sqrt(-4.01)
<			nan
		"nan" may be different, it depends on system libraries.
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		

str2float( {expr})					*str2float()*
		Convert String {expr} to a Float.  This mostly works the same
		as when using a floating point number in an expression, see
		|floating-point-format|.  But it's a bit more permissive.
		E.g., "1e40" is accepted, while in an expression you need to
		write "1.0e40".
		Text after the number is silently ignored.
		The decimal point is always '.', no matter what the locale is
		set to.  A comma ends the number: "12,345.67" is converted to
		12.0.  You can strip out thousands separators with
		|substitute()|: >
			let f = str2float(substitute(text, ',', '', 'g'))
<		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


str2nr( {expr} [, {base}])				*str2nr()*
		Convert string {expr} to a number.
		{base} is the conversion base, it can be 8, 10 or 16.
		When {base} is omitted base 10 is used.  This also means that
		a leading zero doesn't cause octal conversion to be used, as
		with the default String to Number conversion.
		When {base} is 16 a leading "0x" or "0X" is ignored.  With a
		different base the result will be zero.
		Text after the number is silently ignored.


strchars({expr})					*strchars()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of characters
		String {expr} occupies.  Composing characters are counted
		separately.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and |strwidth()|.

strdisplaywidth({expr}[, {col}])			*strdisplaywidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of display cells
		String {expr} occupies on the screen when it starts a {col}.
		When {col} is omitted zero is used.  Otherwise it is the
		screen column where to start.  This matters for Tab
		characters.
		The option settings of the current window are used.  This
		matters for anything that's displayed differently, such as
		'tabstop' and 'display'.
		When {expr} contains characters with East Asian Width Class
		Ambiguous, this function's return value depends on 'ambiwidth'.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strwidth()| and |strchars()|.

strftime({format} [, {time}])				*strftime()*
		The result is a String, which is a formatted date and time, as
		specified by the {format} string.  The given {time} is used,
		or the current time if no time is given.  The accepted
		{format} depends on your system, thus this is not portable!
		See the manual page of the C function strftime() for the
		format.  The maximum length of the result is 80 characters.
		See also |localtime()| and |getftime()|.
		The language can be changed with the |:language| command.
		Examples: >
		  :echo strftime("%c")		   Sun Apr 27 11:49:23 1997
		  :echo strftime("%Y %b %d %X")	   1997 Apr 27 11:53:25
		  :echo strftime("%y%m%d %T")	   970427 11:53:55
		  :echo strftime("%H:%M")	   11:55
		  :echo strftime("%c", getftime("file.c"))
						   Show mod time of file.c.
<		Not available on all systems.  To check use: >
			:if exists("*strftime")

stridx({haystack}, {needle} [, {start}])		*stridx()*
		The result is a Number, which gives the byte index in
		{haystack} of the first occurrence of the String {needle}.
		If {start} is specified, the search starts at index {start}.
		This can be used to find a second match: >
			:let colon1 = stridx(line, ":")
			:let colon2 = stridx(line, ":", colon1 + 1)
<		The search is done case-sensitive.
		For pattern searches use |match()|.
		-1 is returned if the {needle} does not occur in {haystack}.
		See also |strridx()|.
		Examples: >
		  :echo stridx("An Example", "Example")	     3
		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "Start")    0
		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "start")   -1
<						*strstr()* *strchr()*
		stridx() works similar to the C function strstr().  When used
		with a single character it works similar to strchr().

							*string()*
string({expr})	Return {expr} converted to a String.  If {expr} is a Number,
		Float, String or a composition of them, then the result can be
		parsed back with |eval()|.
			{expr} type	result ~
			String		'string'
			Number		123
			Float		123.123456 or 1.123456e8
			Funcref		function('name')
			List		[item, item]
			Dictionary	{key: value, key: value}
		Note that in String values the ' character is doubled.
		Also see |strtrans()|.

							*strlen()*
strlen({expr})	The result is a Number, which is the length of the String
		{expr} in bytes.
		If you want to count the number of multi-byte characters (not
		counting composing characters) use something like this: >

			:let len = strlen(substitute(str, ".", "x", "g"))
<
		If the argument is a Number it is first converted to a String.
		For other types an error is given.
		Also see |len()|, |strchars()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and
		|strwidth()|.

strpart({src}, {start}[, {len}])			*strpart()*
		The result is a String, which is part of {src}, starting from
		byte {start}, with the byte length {len}.
		When non-existing bytes are included, this doesn't result in
		an error, the bytes are simply omitted.
		If {len} is missing, the copy continues from {start} till the
		end of the {src}. >
			strpart("abcdefg", 3, 2)    == "de"
			strpart("abcdefg", -2, 4)   == "ab"
			strpart("abcdefg", 5, 4)    == "fg"
			strpart("abcdefg", 3)	    == "defg"
<		Note: To get the first character, {start} must be 0.  For
		example, to get three bytes under and after the cursor: >
			strpart(getline("."), col(".") - 1, 3)
<
strridx({haystack}, {needle} [, {start}])			*strridx()*
		The result is a Number, which gives the byte index in
		{haystack} of the last occurrence of the String {needle}.
		When {start} is specified, matches beyond this index are
		ignored.  This can be used to find a match before a previous
		match: >
			:let lastcomma = strridx(line, ",")
			:let comma2 = strridx(line, ",", lastcomma - 1)
<		The search is done case-sensitive.
		For pattern searches use |match()|.
		-1 is returned if the {needle} does not occur in {haystack}.
		If the {needle} is empty the length of {haystack} is returned.
		See also |stridx()|.  Examples: >
		  :echo strridx("an angry armadillo", "an")	     3
<							*strrchr()*
		When used with a single character it works similar to the C
		function strrchr().

strtrans({expr})					*strtrans()*
		The result is a String, which is {expr} with all unprintable
		characters translated into printable characters |'isprint'|.
		Like they are shown in a window.  Example: >
			echo strtrans(@a)
<		This displays a newline in register a as "^@" instead of
		starting a new line.

strwidth({expr})					*strwidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of display cells
		String {expr} occupies.  A Tab character is counted as one
		cell, alternatively use |strdisplaywidth()|.
		When {expr} contains characters with East Asian Width Class
		Ambiguous, this function's return value depends on 'ambiwidth'.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and |strchars()|.

submatch({nr}[, {list}])				*submatch()*
		Only for an expression in a |:substitute| command or
		substitute() function.
		Returns the {nr}'th submatch of the matched text.  When {nr}
		is 0 the whole matched text is returned.
		Note that a NL in the string can stand for a line break of a
		multi-line match or a NUL character in the text.
		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.

		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns 
		a list of strings, similar to |getline()| with two arguments. 
		NL characters in the text represent NUL characters in the
		text.
		Only returns more than one item for |:substitute|, inside
		|substitute()| this list will always contain one or zero
		items, since there are no real line breaks.

		Example: >
			:s/\d\+/\=submatch(0) + 1/
<		This finds the first number in the line and adds one to it.
		A line break is included as a newline character.

substitute({expr}, {pat}, {sub}, {flags})		*substitute()*
		The result is a String, which is a copy of {expr}, in which
		the first match of {pat} is replaced with {sub}.
		When {flags} is "g", all matches of {pat} in {expr} are
		replaced.  Otherwise {flags} should be "".
		
		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
		used.

		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
		|sub-replace-special|.	For example, to replace something with
		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.

		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
		unmodified.

		Example: >
			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
<		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
<		results in "TESTING".

		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as
		an expression. See |sub-replace-expression|.  Example: >
			:echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)',
			   \ '\=nr2char("0x" . submatch(1))', 'g')

synID({lnum}, {col}, {trans})				*synID()*
		The result is a Number, which is the syntax ID at the position
		{lnum} and {col} in the current window.
		The syntax ID can be used with |synIDattr()| and
		|synIDtrans()| to obtain syntax information about text.

		{col} is 1 for the leftmost column, {lnum} is 1 for the first
		line.  'synmaxcol' applies, in a longer line zero is returned.

		When {trans} is non-zero, transparent items are reduced to the
		item that they reveal.	This is useful when wanting to know
		the effective color.  When {trans} is zero, the transparent
		item is returned.  This is useful when wanting to know which
		syntax item is effective (e.g. inside parens).
		Warning: This function can be very slow.  Best speed is
		obtained by going through the file in forward direction.

		Example (echoes the name of the syntax item under the cursor): >
			:echo synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 1), "name")
<

synIDattr({synID}, {what} [, {mode}])			*synIDattr()*
		The result is a String, which is the {what} attribute of
		syntax ID {synID}.  This can be used to obtain information
		about a syntax item.
		{mode} can be "gui", "cterm" or "term", to get the attributes
		for that mode.	When {mode} is omitted, or an invalid value is
		used, the attributes for the currently active highlighting are
		used (GUI, cterm or term).
		Use synIDtrans() to follow linked highlight groups.
		{what}		result
		"name"		the name of the syntax item
		"fg"		foreground color (GUI: color name used to set
				the color, cterm: color number as a string,
				term: empty string)
		"bg"		background color (as with "fg")
		"font"		font name (only available in the GUI)
				|highlight-font|
		"sp"		special color (as with "fg") |highlight-guisp|
		"fg#"		like "fg", but for the GUI and the GUI is
				running the name in "#RRGGBB" form
		"bg#"		like "fg#" for "bg"
		"sp#"		like "fg#" for "sp"
		"bold"		"1" if bold
		"italic"	"1" if italic
		"reverse"	"1" if reverse
		"inverse"	"1" if inverse (= reverse)
		"standout"	"1" if standout
		"underline"	"1" if underlined
		"undercurl"	"1" if undercurled

		Example (echoes the color of the syntax item under the
		cursor): >
	:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(synID(line("."), col("."), 1)), "fg")
<
synIDtrans({synID})					*synIDtrans()*
		The result is a Number, which is the translated syntax ID of
		{synID}.  This is the syntax group ID of what is being used to
		highlight the character.  Highlight links given with
		":highlight link" are followed.

synconcealed({lnum}, {col})				*synconcealed()*
		The result is a List. The first item in the list is 0 if the
		character at the position {lnum} and {col} is not part of a
		concealable region, 1 if it is. The second item in the list is
		a string. If the first item is 1, the second item contains the
		text which will be displayed in place of the concealed text,
		depending on the current setting of 'conceallevel'. The third
		and final item in the list is a unique number representing the
		specific syntax region matched. This allows detection of the
		beginning of a new concealable region if there are two
		consecutive regions with the same replacement character.
		For an example use see $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/2html.vim .


synstack({lnum}, {col})					*synstack()*
		Return a |List|, which is the stack of syntax items at the
		position {lnum} and {col} in the current window.  Each item in
		the List is an ID like what |synID()| returns.
		The first item in the List is the outer region, following are
		items contained in that one.  The last one is what |synID()|
		returns, unless not the whole item is highlighted or it is a
		transparent item.
		This function is useful for debugging a syntax file.
		Example that shows the syntax stack under the cursor: >
			for id in synstack(line("."), col("."))
			   echo synIDattr(id, "name")
			endfor
<		When the position specified with {lnum} and {col} is invalid
		nothing is returned.  The position just after the last
		character in a line and the first column in an empty line are
		valid positions.

system({expr} [, {input}])				*system()* *E677*
		Get the output of the shell command {expr} as a string.  See
		|systemlist()| to get the output as a List.

		When {input} is given and is a string this string is written 
		to a file and passed as stdin to the command.  The string is 
		written as-is, you need to take care of using the correct line 
		separators yourself.
		If {input} is given and is a |List| it is written to the file
		in a way |writefile()| does with {binary} set to "b" (i.e.
		with a newline between each list item with newlines inside
		list items converted to NULs).  
		Pipes are not used.

		When prepended by |:silent| the shell will not be set to
		cooked mode.  This is meant to be used for commands that do
		not need the user to type.  It avoids stray characters showing
		up on the screen which require |CTRL-L| to remove. >
			:silent let f = system('ls *.vim')
<
		Note: Use |shellescape()| or |::S| with |expand()| or 
		|fnamemodify()| to escape special characters in a command 
		argument.  Newlines in {expr} may cause the command to fail.  
		The characters in 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' may also 
		cause trouble.
		This is not to be used for interactive commands.

		The result is a String.  Example: >
		    :let files = system("ls " .  shellescape(expand('%:h')))
		    :let files = system('ls ' . expand('%:h:S'))

<		To make the result more system-independent, the shell output
		is filtered to replace <CR> with <NL> for Macintosh, and
		<CR><NL> with <NL> for DOS-like systems.
		To avoid the string being truncated at a NUL, all NUL
		characters are replaced with SOH (0x01).

		The command executed is constructed using several options:
	'shell' 'shellcmdflag' 'shellxquote' {expr} 'shellredir' {tmp} 'shellxquote'
		({tmp} is an automatically generated file name).
		For Unix and OS/2 braces are put around {expr} to allow for
		concatenated commands.

		The command will be executed in "cooked" mode, so that a
		CTRL-C will interrupt the command (on Unix at least).

		The resulting error code can be found in |v:shell_error|.
		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.

		Note that any wrong value in the options mentioned above may
		make the function fail.  It has also been reported to fail
		when using a security agent application.
		Unlike ":!cmd" there is no automatic check for changed files.
		Use |:checktime| to force a check.


systemlist({expr} [, {input}])				*systemlist()*
		Same as |system()|, but returns a |List| with lines (parts of 
		output separated by NL) with NULs transformed into NLs. Output 
		is the same as |readfile()| will output with {binary} argument 
		set to "b".

		Returns an empty string on error, so be careful not to run 
		into |E706|.


tabpagebuflist([{arg}])					*tabpagebuflist()*
		The result is a |List|, where each item is the number of the
		buffer associated with each window in the current tab page.
		{arg} specifies the number of tab page to be used.  When
		omitted the current tab page is used.
		When {arg} is invalid the number zero is returned.
		To get a list of all buffers in all tabs use this: >
			let buflist = []
			for i in range(tabpagenr('$'))
			   call extend(buflist, tabpagebuflist(i + 1))
			endfor
<		Note that a buffer may appear in more than one window.


tabpagenr([{arg}])					*tabpagenr()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of the current
		tab page.  The first tab page has number 1.
		When the optional argument is "$", the number of the last tab
		page is returned (the tab page count).
		The number can be used with the |:tab| command.


tabpagewinnr({tabarg} [, {arg}])			*tabpagewinnr()*
		Like |winnr()| but for tab page {tabarg}.
		{tabarg} specifies the number of tab page to be used.
		{arg} is used like with |winnr()|:
		- When omitted the current window number is returned.  This is
		  the window which will be used when going to this tab page.
		- When "$" the number of windows is returned.
		- When "#" the previous window nr is returned.
		Useful examples: >
		    tabpagewinnr(1)	    " current window of tab page 1
		    tabpagewinnr(4, '$')    " number of windows in tab page 4
<		When {tabarg} is invalid zero is returned.

							*tagfiles()*
tagfiles()	Returns a |List| with the file names used to search for tags
		for the current buffer.  This is the 'tags' option expanded.


taglist({expr})							*taglist()*
		Returns a list of tags matching the regular expression {expr}.
		Each list item is a dictionary with at least the following
		entries:
			name		Name of the tag.
			filename	Name of the file where the tag is
					defined.  It is either relative to the
					current directory or a full path.
			cmd		Ex command used to locate the tag in
					the file.
			kind		Type of the tag.  The value for this
					entry depends on the language specific
					kind values.  Only available when
					using a tags file generated by
					Exuberant ctags or hdrtag.
			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to
					|static-tag| for more information.
		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is
		contained in.

		The ex-command 'cmd' can be either an ex search pattern, a
		line number or a line number followed by a byte number.

		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.

		To get an exact tag match, the anchors '^' and '$' should be
		used in {expr}.  This also make the function work faster.
		Refer to |tag-regexp| for more information about the tag
		search regular expression pattern.

		Refer to |'tags'| for information about how the tags file is
		located by Vim. Refer to |tags-file-format| for the format of
		the tags file generated by the different ctags tools.

tempname()					*tempname()* *temp-file-name*
		The result is a String, which is the name of a file that
		doesn't exist.	It can be used for a temporary file.  The name
		is different for at least 26 consecutive calls.  Example: >
			:let tmpfile = tempname()
			:exe "redir > " . tmpfile
<		For Unix, the file will be in a private directory |tempfile|.
		For MS-Windows forward slashes are used when the 'shellslash'
		option is set or when 'shellcmdflag' starts with '-'.


tan({expr})						*tan()*
		Return the tangent of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|
		in the range [-inf, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo tan(10)
<			0.648361 >
			:echo tan(-4.01)
<			-1.181502
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


tanh({expr})						*tanh()*
		Return the hyperbolic tangent of {expr} as a |Float| in the
		range [-1, 1].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo tanh(0.5)
<			0.462117 >
			:echo tanh(-1)
<			-0.761594
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


tolower({expr})						*tolower()*
		The result is a copy of the String given, with all uppercase
		characters turned into lowercase (just like applying |gu| to
		the string).

toupper({expr})						*toupper()*
		The result is a copy of the String given, with all lowercase
		characters turned into uppercase (just like applying |gU| to
		the string).

tr({src}, {fromstr}, {tostr})				*tr()*
		The result is a copy of the {src} string with all characters
		which appear in {fromstr} replaced by the character in that
		position in the {tostr} string.  Thus the first character in
		{fromstr} is translated into the first character in {tostr}
		and so on.  Exactly like the unix "tr" command.
		This code also deals with multibyte characters properly.

		Examples: >
			echo tr("hello there", "ht", "HT")
<		returns "Hello THere" >
			echo tr("<blob>", "<>", "{}")
<		returns "{blob}"

trunc({expr})							*trunc()*
		Return the largest integral value with magnitude less than or
		equal to {expr} as a |Float| (truncate towards zero).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo trunc(1.456)
<			1.0  >
			echo trunc(-5.456)
<			-5.0  >
			echo trunc(4.0)
<			4.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		
							*type()*
type({expr})	The result is a Number, depending on the type of {expr}:
			Number:	    0
			String:	    1
			Funcref:    2
			List:	    3
			Dictionary: 4
			Float:	    5
		To avoid the magic numbers it should be used this way: >
			:if type(myvar) == type(0)
			:if type(myvar) == type("")
			:if type(myvar) == type(function("tr"))
			:if type(myvar) == type([])
			:if type(myvar) == type({})
			:if type(myvar) == type(0.0)

undofile({name})					*undofile()*
		Return the name of the undo file that would be used for a file
		with name {name} when writing.  This uses the 'undodir'
		option, finding directories that exist.  It does not check if
		the undo file exists.
		{name} is always expanded to the full path, since that is what
		is used internally.
		If {name} is empty undofile() returns an empty string, since a
		buffer without a file name will not write an undo file.
		Useful in combination with |:wundo| and |:rundo|.
		When compiled without the +persistent_undo option this always
		returns an empty string.

undotree()						*undotree()*
		Return the current state of the undo tree in a dictionary with
		the following items:
		  "seq_last"	The highest undo sequence number used.
		  "seq_cur"	The sequence number of the current position in
				the undo tree.  This differs from "seq_last"
				when some changes were undone.
		  "time_cur"	Time last used for |:earlier| and related
				commands.  Use |strftime()| to convert to
				something readable.
		  "save_last"	Number of the last file write.  Zero when no
				write yet.
		  "save_cur"	Number of the current position in the undo
				tree.  
		  "synced"	Non-zero when the last undo block was synced.
				This happens when waiting from input from the
				user.  See |undo-blocks|.
		  "entries"	A list of dictionaries with information about
				undo blocks.

		The first item in the "entries" list is the oldest undo item.
		Each List item is a Dictionary with these items:
		  "seq"		Undo sequence number.  Same as what appears in
				|:undolist|.
		  "time"	Timestamp when the change happened.  Use
				|strftime()| to convert to something readable.
		  "newhead"	Only appears in the item that is the last one
				that was added.  This marks the last change
				and where further changes will be added.
		  "curhead"	Only appears in the item that is the last one
				that was undone.  This marks the current
				position in the undo tree, the block that will
				be used by a redo command.  When nothing was
				undone after the last change this item will
				not appear anywhere.
		  "save"	Only appears on the last block before a file
				write.  The number is the write count.  The
				first write has number 1, the last one the
				"save_last" mentioned above.
		  "alt"		Alternate entry.  This is again a List of undo
				blocks.  Each item may again have an "alt"
				item.

uniq({list} [, {func} [, {dict}]])			*uniq()* *E882*
		Remove second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent
		{list} items in-place.  Returns {list}.  If you want a list
		to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let newlist = uniq(copy(mylist))
<		The default compare function uses the string representation of
		each item.  For the use of {func} and {dict} see |sort()|.

values({dict})						*values()*
		Return a |List| with all the values of {dict}.	The |List| is
		in arbitrary order.


virtcol({expr})						*virtcol()*
		The result is a Number, which is the screen column of the file
		position given with {expr}.  That is, the last screen position
		occupied by the character at that position, when the screen
		would be of unlimited width.  When there is a <Tab> at the
		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
		For the byte position use |col()|.
		For the use of {expr} see |col()|.
		When 'virtualedit' is used {expr} can be [lnum, col, off], where
		"off" is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
		character.  When "off" is omitted zero is used.
		When Virtual editing is active in the current mode, a position
		beyond the end of the line can be returned. |'virtualedit'|
		The accepted positions are:
		    .	    the cursor position
		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
			    number of displayed characters in the cursor line
			    plus one)
		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
			    returned)
		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
		Examples: >
  virtcol(".")	   with text "foo^Lbar", with cursor on the "^L", returns 5
  virtcol("$")	   with text "foo^Lbar", returns 9
  virtcol("'t")    with text "	  there", with 't at 'h', returns 6
<		The first column is 1.	0 is returned for an error.
		A more advanced example that echoes the maximum length of
		all lines: >
		    echo max(map(range(1, line('$')), "virtcol([v:val, '$'])"))


visualmode([expr])						*visualmode()*
		The result is a String, which describes the last Visual mode
		used in the current buffer.  Initially it returns an empty
		string, but once Visual mode has been used, it returns "v",
		"V", or "<CTRL-V>" (a single CTRL-V character) for
		character-wise, line-wise, or block-wise Visual mode
		respectively.
		Example: >
			:exe "normal " . visualmode()
<		This enters the same Visual mode as before.  It is also useful
		in scripts if you wish to act differently depending on the
		Visual mode that was used.
		If Visual mode is active, use |mode()| to get the Visual mode
		(e.g., in a |:vmap|).
							*non-zero-arg*
		If [expr] is supplied and it evaluates to a non-zero Number or
		a non-empty String, then the Visual mode will be cleared and
		the old value is returned.  Note that " " and "0" are also
		non-empty strings, thus cause the mode to be cleared.  A List,
		Dictionary or Float is not a Number or String, thus does not
		cause the mode to be cleared.

wildmenumode()					*wildmenumode()*
		Returns non-zero when the wildmenu is active and zero
		otherwise.  See 'wildmenu' and 'wildmode'.
		This can be used in mappings to handle the 'wildcharm' option
		gracefully. (Makes only sense with |mapmode-c| mappings).

		For example to make <c-j> work like <down> in wildmode, use: >
    :cnoremap <expr> <C-j> wildmenumode() ? "\<Down>\<Tab>" : "\<c-j>"
<
		(Note, this needs the 'wildcharm' option set appropriately).


							*winbufnr()*
winbufnr({nr})	The result is a Number, which is the number of the buffer
		associated with window {nr}.  When {nr} is zero, the number of
		the buffer in the current window is returned.  When window
		{nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		Example: >
  :echo "The file in the current window is " . bufname(winbufnr(0))
<
							*wincol()*
wincol()	The result is a Number, which is the virtual column of the
		cursor in the window.  This is counting screen cells from the
		left side of the window.  The leftmost column is one.

winheight({nr})						*winheight()*
		The result is a Number, which is the height of window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero, the height of the current window is
		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		An existing window always has a height of zero or more.
		Examples: >
  :echo "The current window has " . winheight(0) . " lines."
<
							*winline()*
winline()	The result is a Number, which is the screen line of the cursor
		in the window.	This is counting screen lines from the top of
		the window.  The first line is one.
		If the cursor was moved the view on the file will be updated
		first, this may cause a scroll.

							*winnr()*
winnr([{arg}])	The result is a Number, which is the number of the current
		window.  The top window has number 1.
		When the optional argument is "$", the number of the
		last window is returned (the window count). >
			let window_count = winnr('$')
<		When the optional argument is "#", the number of the last
		accessed window is returned (where |CTRL-W_p| goes to).
		If there is no previous window or it is in another tab page 0
		is returned.
		The number can be used with |CTRL-W_w| and ":wincmd w"
		|:wincmd|.
		Also see |tabpagewinnr()|.

							*winrestcmd()*
winrestcmd()	Returns a sequence of |:resize| commands that should restore
		the current window sizes.  Only works properly when no windows
		are opened or closed and the current window and tab page is
		unchanged.
		Example: >
			:let cmd = winrestcmd()
			:call MessWithWindowSizes()
			:exe cmd
<
							*winrestview()*
winrestview({dict})
		Uses the |Dictionary| returned by |winsaveview()| to restore
		the view of the current window.
		Note: The {dict} does not have to contain all values, that are
		returned by |winsaveview()|. If values are missing, those
		settings won't be restored. So you can use: >
		    :call winrestview({'curswant': 4})
<
		This will only set the curswant value (the column the cursor
		wants to move on vertical movements) of the cursor to column 5
		(yes, that is 5), while all other settings will remain the
		same. This is useful, if you set the cursor position manually.

		If you have changed the values the result is unpredictable.
		If the window size changed the result won't be the same.

							*winsaveview()*
winsaveview()	Returns a |Dictionary| that contains information to restore
		the view of the current window.  Use |winrestview()| to
		restore the view.
		This is useful if you have a mapping that jumps around in the
		buffer and you want to go back to the original view.
		This does not save fold information.  Use the 'foldenable'
		option to temporarily switch off folding, so that folds are
		not opened when moving around. This may have side effects.
		The return value includes:
			lnum		cursor line number
			col		cursor column (Note: the first column
					zero, as opposed to what getpos()
					returns)
			coladd		cursor column offset for 'virtualedit'
			curswant	column for vertical movement
			topline		first line in the window
			topfill		filler lines, only in diff mode
			leftcol		first column displayed
			skipcol		columns skipped
		Note that no option values are saved.


winwidth({nr})						*winwidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the width of window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero, the width of the current window is
		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		An existing window always has a width of zero or more.
		Examples: >
  :echo "The current window has " . winwidth(0) . " columns."
  :if winwidth(0) <= 50
  :  exe "normal 50\<C-W>|"
  :endif
<
							*writefile()*
writefile({list}, {fname} [, {binary}])
		Write |List| {list} to file {fname}.  Each list item is
		separated with a NL.  Each list item must be a String or
		Number.
		When {binary} is equal to "b" binary mode is used: There will
		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.
		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
		to writefile().
		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
		error message if the file can't be created or when writing
		fails.
		Also see |readfile()|.
		To copy a file byte for byte: >
			:let fl = readfile("foo", "b")
			:call writefile(fl, "foocopy", "b")


xor({expr}, {expr})					*xor()*
		Bitwise XOR on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let bits = xor(bits, 0x80)
<


							*feature-list*
There are four types of features:
1.  Features that are only supported when they have been enabled when Vim
    was compiled |+feature-list|.  Example: >
	:if has("cindent")
2.  Features that are only supported when certain conditions have been met.
    Example: >
	:if has("gui_running")
<							*has-patch*
3.  Included patches.  The "patch123" feature means that patch 123 has been
    included.  Note that this form does not check the version of Vim, you need
    to inspect |v:version| for that.
    Example (checking version 6.2.148 or later): >
	:if v:version > 602 || v:version == 602 && has("patch148")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

4.  Beyond a certain version or at a certain version and including a specific
    patch.  The "patch-7.4.237" feature means that the Vim version is 7.5 or
    later, or it is version 7.4 and patch 237 was included.
    Note that this only works for patch 7.4.237 and later, before that you
    need to use the example above that checks v:version.  Example: >
	:if has("patch-7.4.248")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

							*string-match*
Matching a pattern in a String

A regexp pattern as explained at |pattern| is normally used to find a match in
the buffer lines.  When a pattern is used to find a match in a String, almost
everything works in the same way.  The difference is that a String is handled
like it is one line.  When it contains a "\n" character, this is not seen as a
line break for the pattern.  It can be matched with a "\n" in the pattern, or
with ".".  Example: >
	:let a = "aaaa\nxxxx"
	:echo matchstr(a, "..\n..")
	aa
	xx
	:echo matchstr(a, "a.x")
	a
	x

Don't forget that "^" will only match at the first character of the String and
"$" at the last character of the string.  They don't match after or before a
"\n".

==============================================================================
5. Defining functions					*user-functions*

New functions can be defined.  These can be called just like builtin
functions.  The function executes a sequence of Ex commands.  Normal mode
commands can be executed with the |:normal| command.

The function name must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid confusion with
builtin functions.  To prevent from using the same name in different scripts
avoid obvious, short names.  A good habit is to start the function name with
the name of the script, e.g., "HTMLcolor()".

It's also possible to use curly braces, see |curly-braces-names|.  And the
|autoload| facility is useful to define a function only when it's called.

							*local-function*
A function local to a script must start with "s:".  A local script function
can only be called from within the script and from functions, user commands
and autocommands defined in the script.  It is also possible to call the
function from a mapping defined in the script, but then |<SID>| must be used
instead of "s:" when the mapping is expanded outside of the script.
There are only script-local functions, no buffer-local or window-local
functions.

					*:fu* *:function* *E128* *E129* *E123*
:fu[nction]		List all functions and their arguments.

:fu[nction] {name}	List function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init

:fu[nction] /{pattern}	List functions with a name matching {pattern}.
			Example that lists all functions ending with "File": >
				:function /File$
<
							*:function-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a function will also display where it was
last defined. Example: >

    :verbose function SetFileTypeSH
	function SetFileTypeSH(name)
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/filetype.vim
<
See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

						*E124* *E125* *E853* *E884*
:fu[nction][!] {name}([arguments]) [range] [abort] [dict]
			Define a new function by the name {name}.  The name
			must be made of alphanumeric characters and '_', and
			must start with a capital or "s:" (see above).  Note
			that using "b:" or "g:" is not allowed. (since patch
			7.4.260 E884 is given if the function name has a colon
			in the name, e.g. for "foo:bar()".  Before that patch
			no error was given).

			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init(arg)
<			"dict" must be an existing dictionary.	The entry
			"init" is added if it didn't exist yet.  Otherwise [!]
			is required to overwrite an existing function.	The
			result is a |Funcref| to a numbered function.  The
			function can only be used with a |Funcref| and will be
			deleted if there are no more references to it.
								*E127* *E122*
			When a function by this name already exists and [!] is
			not used an error message is given.  When [!] is used,
			an existing function is silently replaced.  Unless it
			is currently being executed, that is an error.

			For the {arguments} see |function-argument|.

					*:func-range* *a:firstline* *a:lastline*
			When the [range] argument is added, the function is
			expected to take care of a range itself.  The range is
			passed as "a:firstline" and "a:lastline".  If [range]
			is excluded, ":{range}call" will call the function for
			each line in the range, with the cursor on the start
			of each line.  See |function-range-example|.
			The cursor is still moved to the first line of the
			range, as is the case with all Ex commands.
								*:func-abort*
			When the [abort] argument is added, the function will
			abort as soon as an error is detected.
								*:func-dict*
			When the [dict] argument is added, the function must
			be invoked through an entry in a |Dictionary|.	The
			local variable "self" will then be set to the
			dictionary.  See |Dictionary-function|.

						*function-search-undo*
			The last used search pattern and the redo command "."
			will not be changed by the function.  This also
			implies that the effect of |:nohlsearch| is undone
			when the function returns.

					*:endf* *:endfunction* *E126* *E193*
:endf[unction]		The end of a function definition.  Must be on a line
			by its own, without other commands.

					*:delf* *:delfunction* *E130* *E131*
:delf[unction] {name}	Delete function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:delfunc dict.init
<			This will remove the "init" entry from "dict".	The
			function is deleted if there are no more references to
			it.
							*:retu* *:return* *E133*
:retu[rn] [expr]	Return from a function.  When "[expr]" is given, it is
			evaluated and returned as the result of the function.
			If "[expr]" is not given, the number 0 is returned.
			When a function ends without an explicit ":return",
			the number 0 is returned.
			Note that there is no check for unreachable lines,
			thus there is no warning if commands follow ":return".

			If the ":return" is used after a |:try| but before the
			matching |:finally| (if present), the commands
			following the ":finally" up to the matching |:endtry|
			are executed first.  This process applies to all
			nested ":try"s inside the function.  The function
			returns at the outermost ":endtry".

						*function-argument* *a:var*
An argument can be defined by giving its name.	In the function this can then
be used as "a:name" ("a:" for argument).
					*a:0* *a:1* *a:000* *E740* *...*
Up to 20 arguments can be given, separated by commas.  After the named
arguments an argument "..." can be specified, which means that more arguments
may optionally be following.  In the function the extra arguments can be used
as "a:1", "a:2", etc.  "a:0" is set to the number of extra arguments (which
can be 0).  "a:000" is set to a |List| that contains these arguments.  Note
that "a:1" is the same as "a:000[0]".
								*E742*
The a: scope and the variables in it cannot be changed, they are fixed.
However, if a |List| or |Dictionary| is used, you can change their contents.
Thus you can pass a |List| to a function and have the function add an item to
it.  If you want to make sure the function cannot change a |List| or
|Dictionary| use |:lockvar|.

When not using "...", the number of arguments in a function call must be equal
to the number of named arguments.  When using "...", the number of arguments
may be larger.

It is also possible to define a function without any arguments.  You must
still supply the () then.  The body of the function follows in the next lines,
until the matching |:endfunction|.  It is allowed to define another function
inside a function body.

							*local-variables*
Inside a function variables can be used.  These are local variables, which
will disappear when the function returns.  Global variables need to be
accessed with "g:".

Example: >
  :function Table(title, ...)
  :  echohl Title
  :  echo a:title
  :  echohl None
  :  echo a:0 . " items:"
  :  for s in a:000
  :    echon ' ' . s
  :  endfor
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  call Table("Table", "line1", "line2")
  call Table("Empty Table")

To return more than one value, return a |List|: >
  :function Compute(n1, n2)
  :  if a:n2 == 0
  :    return ["fail", 0]
  :  endif
  :  return ["ok", a:n1 / a:n2]
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  :let [success, div] = Compute(102, 6)
  :if success == "ok"
  :  echo div
  :endif
<
						*:cal* *:call* *E107* *E117*
:[range]cal[l] {name}([arguments])
		Call a function.  The name of the function and its arguments
		are as specified with |:function|.  Up to 20 arguments can be
		used.  The returned value is discarded.
		Without a range and for functions that accept a range, the
		function is called once.  When a range is given the cursor is
		positioned at the start of the first line before executing the
		function.
		When a range is given and the function doesn't handle it
		itself, the function is executed for each line in the range,
		with the cursor in the first column of that line.  The cursor
		is left at the last line (possibly moved by the last function
		call).	The arguments are re-evaluated for each line.  Thus
		this works:
						*function-range-example*  >
	:function Mynumber(arg)
	:  echo line(".") . " " . a:arg
	:endfunction
	:1,5call Mynumber(getline("."))
<
		The "a:firstline" and "a:lastline" are defined anyway, they
		can be used to do something different at the start or end of
		the range.

		Example of a function that handles the range itself: >

	:function Cont() range
	:  execute (a:firstline + 1) . "," . a:lastline . 's/^/\t\\ '
	:endfunction
	:4,8call Cont()
<
		This function inserts the continuation character "\" in front
		of all the lines in the range, except the first one.

		When the function returns a composite value it can be further
		dereferenced, but the range will not be used then.  Example: >
	:4,8call GetDict().method()
<		Here GetDict() gets the range but method() does not.

								*E132*
The recursiveness of user functions is restricted with the |'maxfuncdepth'|
option.


AUTOMATICALLY LOADING FUNCTIONS ~
							*autoload-functions*
When using many or large functions, it's possible to automatically define them
only when they are used.  There are two methods: with an autocommand and with
the "autoload" directory in 'runtimepath'.


Using an autocommand ~

This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.14|.

The autocommand is useful if you have a plugin that is a long Vim script file.
You can define the autocommand and quickly quit the script with |:finish|.
That makes Vim startup faster.	The autocommand should then load the same file
again, setting a variable to skip the |:finish| command.

Use the FuncUndefined autocommand event with a pattern that matches the
function(s) to be defined.  Example: >

	:au FuncUndefined BufNet* source ~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim

The file "~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim" should then define functions that start with
"BufNet".  Also see |FuncUndefined|.


Using an autoload script ~
							*autoload* *E746*
This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.15|.

Using a script in the "autoload" directory is simpler, but requires using
exactly the right file name.  A function that can be autoloaded has a name
like this: >

	:call filename#funcname()

When such a function is called, and it is not defined yet, Vim will search the
"autoload" directories in 'runtimepath' for a script file called
"filename.vim".  For example "~/.vim/autoload/filename.vim".  That file should
then define the function like this: >

	function filename#funcname()
	   echo "Done!"
	endfunction

The file name and the name used before the # in the function must match
exactly, and the defined function must have the name exactly as it will be
called.

It is possible to use subdirectories.  Every # in the function name works like
a path separator.  Thus when calling a function: >

	:call foo#bar#func()

Vim will look for the file "autoload/foo/bar.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

This also works when reading a variable that has not been set yet: >

	:let l = foo#bar#lvar

However, when the autoload script was already loaded it won't be loaded again
for an unknown variable.

When assigning a value to such a variable nothing special happens.  This can
be used to pass settings to the autoload script before it's loaded: >

	:let foo#bar#toggle = 1
	:call foo#bar#func()

Note that when you make a mistake and call a function that is supposed to be
defined in an autoload script, but the script doesn't actually define the
function, the script will be sourced every time you try to call the function.
And you will get an error message every time.

Also note that if you have two script files, and one calls a function in the
other and vice versa, before the used function is defined, it won't work.
Avoid using the autoload functionality at the toplevel.

Hint: If you distribute a bunch of scripts you can pack them together with the
|vimball| utility.  Also read the user manual |distribute-script|.

==============================================================================
6. Curly braces names					*curly-braces-names*

In most places where you can use a variable, you can use a "curly braces name"
variable.  This is a regular variable name with one or more expressions
wrapped in braces {} like this: >
	my_{adjective}_variable

When Vim encounters this, it evaluates the expression inside the braces, puts
that in place of the expression, and re-interprets the whole as a variable
name.  So in the above example, if the variable "adjective" was set to
"noisy", then the reference would be to "my_noisy_variable", whereas if
"adjective" was set to "quiet", then it would be to "my_quiet_variable".

One application for this is to create a set of variables governed by an option
value.	For example, the statement >
	echo my_{&background}_message

would output the contents of "my_dark_message" or "my_light_message" depending
on the current value of 'background'.

You can use multiple brace pairs: >
	echo my_{adverb}_{adjective}_message
..or even nest them: >
	echo my_{ad{end_of_word}}_message
where "end_of_word" is either "verb" or "jective".

However, the expression inside the braces must evaluate to a valid single
variable name, e.g. this is invalid: >
	:let foo='a + b'
	:echo c{foo}d
.. since the result of expansion is "ca + bd", which is not a variable name.

						*curly-braces-function-names*
You can call and define functions by an evaluated name in a similar way.
Example: >
	:let func_end='whizz'
	:call my_func_{func_end}(parameter)

This would call the function "my_func_whizz(parameter)".

This does NOT work: >
  :let i = 3
  :let @{i} = ''  " error
  :echo @{i}      " error

==============================================================================
7. Commands						*expression-commands*

:let {var-name} = {expr1}				*:let* *E18*
			Set internal variable {var-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  The variable will get the type
			from the {expr}.  If {var-name} didn't exist yet, it
			is created.

:let {var-name}[{idx}] = {expr1}			*E689*
			Set a list item to the result of the expression
			{expr1}.  {var-name} must refer to a list and {idx}
			must be a valid index in that list.  For nested list
			the index can be repeated.
			This cannot be used to add an item to a |List|.
			This cannot be used to set a byte in a String.	You
			can do that like this: >
				:let var = var[0:2] . 'X' . var[4:]
<
							*E711* *E719*
:let {var-name}[{idx1}:{idx2}] = {expr1}		*E708* *E709* *E710*
			Set a sequence of items in a |List| to the result of
			the expression {expr1}, which must be a list with the
			correct number of items.
			{idx1} can be omitted, zero is used instead.
			{idx2} can be omitted, meaning the end of the list.
			When the selected range of items is partly past the
			end of the list, items will be added.

					*:let+=* *:let-=* *:let.=* *E734*
:let {var} += {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} + {expr1}".
:let {var} -= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} - {expr1}".
:let {var} .= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} . {expr1}".
			These fail if {var} was not set yet and when the type
			of {var} and {expr1} don't fit the operator.


:let ${env-name} = {expr1}			*:let-environment* *:let-$*
			Set environment variable {env-name} to the result of
			the expression {expr1}.  The type is always String.
:let ${env-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to the environment variable {env-name}.
			If the environment variable didn't exist yet this
			works like "=".

:let @{reg-name} = {expr1}			*:let-register* *:let-@*
			Write the result of the expression {expr1} in register
			{reg-name}.  {reg-name} must be a single letter, and
			must be the name of a writable register (see
			|registers|).  "@@" can be used for the unnamed
			register, "@/" for the search pattern.
			If the result of {expr1} ends in a <CR> or <NL>, the
			register will be linewise, otherwise it will be set to
			characterwise.
			This can be used to clear the last search pattern: >
				:let @/ = ""
<			This is different from searching for an empty string,
			that would match everywhere.

:let @{reg-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to register {reg-name}.	If the
			register was empty it's like setting it to {expr1}.

:let &{option-name} = {expr1}			*:let-option* *:let-&*
			Set option {option-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  A String or Number value is
			always converted to the type of the option.
			For an option local to a window or buffer the effect
			is just like using the |:set| command: both the local
			value and the global value are changed.
			Example: >
				:let &path = &path . ',/usr/local/include'

:let &{option-name} .= {expr1}
			For a string option: Append {expr1} to the value.
			Does not insert a comma like |:set+=|.

:let &{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &{option-name} -= {expr1}
			For a number or boolean option: Add or subtract
			{expr1}.

:let &l:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the local value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setlocal|.

:let &g:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the global value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setglobal|.

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] = {expr1}		*:let-unpack* *E687* *E688*
			{expr1} must evaluate to a |List|.  The first item in
			the list is assigned to {name1}, the second item to
			{name2}, etc.
			The number of names must match the number of items in
			the |List|.
			Each name can be one of the items of the ":let"
			command as mentioned above.
			Example: >
				:let [s, item] = GetItem(s)
<			Detail: {expr1} is evaluated first, then the
			assignments are done in sequence.  This matters if
			{name2} depends on {name1}.  Example: >
				:let x = [0, 1]
				:let i = 0
				:let [i, x[i]] = [1, 2]
				:echo x
<			The result is [0, 2].

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] .= {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] += {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] = {expr1}
			Like |:let-unpack| above, but the |List| may have more
			items than there are names.  A list of the remaining
			items is assigned to {lastname}.  If there are no
			remaining items {lastname} is set to an empty list.
			Example: >
				:let [a, b; rest] = ["aval", "bval", 3, 4]
<
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] .= {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] += {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

								*E121*
:let {var-name}	..	List the value of variable {var-name}.	Multiple
			variable names may be given.  Special names recognized
			here:				*E738*
			  g:	global variables
			  b:	local buffer variables
			  w:	local window variables
			  t:	local tab page variables
			  s:	script-local variables
			  l:	local function variables
			  v:	Vim variables.

:let			List the values of all variables.  The type of the
			variable is indicated before the value:
			    <nothing>	String
				#	Number
				*	Funcref


:unl[et][!] {name} ...				*:unlet* *:unl* *E108* *E795*
			Remove the internal variable {name}.  Several variable
			names can be given, they are all removed.  The name
			may also be a |List| or |Dictionary| item.
			With [!] no error message is given for non-existing
			variables.
			One or more items from a |List| can be removed: >
				:unlet list[3]	  " remove fourth item
				:unlet list[3:]   " remove fourth item to last
<			One item from a |Dictionary| can be removed at a time: >
				:unlet dict['two']
				:unlet dict.two
<			This is especially useful to clean up used global
			variables and script-local variables (these are not
			deleted when the script ends).  Function-local
			variables are automatically deleted when the function
			ends.

:lockv[ar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:lockvar* *:lockv*
			Lock the internal variable {name}.  Locking means that
			it can no longer be changed (until it is unlocked).
			A locked variable can be deleted: >
				:lockvar v
				:let v = 'asdf'		" fails!
				:unlet v
<							*E741*
			If you try to change a locked variable you get an
			error message: "E741: Value of {name} is locked"

			[depth] is relevant when locking a |List| or
			|Dictionary|.  It specifies how deep the locking goes:
				1	Lock the |List| or |Dictionary| itself,
					cannot add or remove items, but can
					still change their values.
				2	Also lock the values, cannot change
					the items.  If an item is a |List| or
					|Dictionary|, cannot add or remove
					items, but can still change the
					values.
				3	Like 2 but for the |List| /
					|Dictionary| in the |List| /
					|Dictionary|, one level deeper.
			The default [depth] is 2, thus when {name} is a |List|
			or |Dictionary| the values cannot be changed.
								*E743*
			For unlimited depth use [!] and omit [depth].
			However, there is a maximum depth of 100 to catch
			loops.

			Note that when two variables refer to the same |List|
			and you lock one of them, the |List| will also be
			locked when used through the other variable.
			Example: >
				:let l = [0, 1, 2, 3]
				:let cl = l
				:lockvar l
				:let cl[1] = 99		" won't work!
<			You may want to make a copy of a list to avoid this.
			See |deepcopy()|.


:unlo[ckvar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:unlockvar* *:unlo*
			Unlock the internal variable {name}.  Does the
			opposite of |:lockvar|.


:if {expr1}			*:if* *:endif* *:en* *E171* *E579* *E580*
:en[dif]		Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.

			From Vim version 4.5 until 5.0, every Ex command in
			between the ":if" and ":endif" is ignored.  These two
			commands were just to allow for future expansions in a
			backwards compatible way.  Nesting was allowed.  Note
			that any ":else" or ":elseif" was ignored, the "else"
			part was not executed either.

			You can use this to remain compatible with older
			versions: >
				:if version >= 500
				:  version-5-specific-commands
				:endif
<			The commands still need to be parsed to find the
			"endif".  Sometimes an older Vim has a problem with a
			new command.  For example, ":silent" is recognized as
			a ":substitute" command.  In that case ":execute" can
			avoid problems: >
				:if version >= 600
				:  execute "silent 1,$delete"
				:endif
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly in between ":if" and ":endif".

						*:else* *:el* *E581* *E583*
:el[se]			Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if they previously were not being
			executed.

					*:elseif* *:elsei* *E582* *E584*
:elsei[f] {expr1}	Short for ":else" ":if", with the addition that there
			is no extra ":endif".

:wh[ile] {expr1}			*:while* *:endwhile* *:wh* *:endw*
						*E170* *E585* *E588* *E733*
:endw[hile]		Repeat the commands between ":while" and ":endwhile",
			as long as {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.
			When an error is detected from a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endwhile".
			Example: >
				:let lnum = 1
				:while lnum <= line("$")
				   :call FixLine(lnum)
				   :let lnum = lnum + 1
				:endwhile
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly inside a ":while" and ":for" loop.

:for {var} in {list}					*:for* *E690* *E732*
:endfo[r]						*:endfo* *:endfor*
			Repeat the commands between ":for" and ":endfor" for
			each item in {list}.  Variable {var} is set to the
			value of each item.
			When an error is detected for a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endfor".
			Changing {list} inside the loop affects what items are
			used.  Make a copy if this is unwanted: >
				:for item in copy(mylist)
<			When not making a copy, Vim stores a reference to the
			next item in the list, before executing the commands
			with the current item.	Thus the current item can be
			removed without effect.  Removing any later item means
			it will not be found.  Thus the following example
			works (an inefficient way to make a list empty): >
				for item in mylist
				   call remove(mylist, 0)
				endfor
<			Note that reordering the list (e.g., with sort() or
			reverse()) may have unexpected effects.
			Note that the type of each list item should be
			identical to avoid errors for the type of {var}
			changing.  Unlet the variable at the end of the loop
			to allow multiple item types: >
				for item in ["foo", ["bar"]]
				   echo item
				   unlet item  " E706 without this
				endfor

:for [{var1}, {var2}, ...] in {listlist}
:endfo[r]
			Like ":for" above, but each item in {listlist} must be
			a list, of which each item is assigned to {var1},
			{var2}, etc.  Example: >
				:for [lnum, col] in [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 8]]
				   :echo getline(lnum)[col]
				:endfor
<
						*:continue* *:con* *E586*
:con[tinue]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, jumps back
			to the start of the loop.
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps back to the start of the loop.

						*:break* *:brea* *E587*
:brea[k]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, skips to
			the command after the matching ":endwhile" or
			":endfor".
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps to the command after the loop.

:try				*:try* *:endt* *:endtry* *E600* *E601* *E602*
:endt[ry]		Change the error handling for the commands between
			":try" and ":endtry" including everything being
			executed across ":source" commands, function calls,
			or autocommand invocations.

			When an error or interrupt is detected and there is
			a |:finally| command following, execution continues
			after the ":finally".  Otherwise, or when the
			":endtry" is reached thereafter, the next
			(dynamically) surrounding ":try" is checked for
			a corresponding ":finally" etc.  Then the script
			processing is terminated.  (Whether a function
			definition has an "abort" argument does not matter.)
			Example: >
		:try | edit too much | finally | echo "cleanup" | endtry
		:echo "impossible"	" not reached, script terminated above
<
			Moreover, an error or interrupt (dynamically) inside
			":try" and ":endtry" is converted to an exception.  It
			can be caught as if it were thrown by a |:throw|
			command (see |:catch|).  In this case, the script
			processing is not terminated.

			The value "Vim:Interrupt" is used for an interrupt
			exception.  An error in a Vim command is converted
			to a value of the form "Vim({command}):{errmsg}",
			other errors are converted to a value of the form
			"Vim:{errmsg}".  {command} is the full command name,
			and {errmsg} is the message that is displayed if the
			error exception is not caught, always beginning with
			the error number.
			Examples: >
		:try | sleep 100 | catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/ | endtry
		:try | edit | catch /^Vim(edit):E\d\+/ | echo "error" | endtry
<
					*:cat* *:catch* *E603* *E604* *E605*
:cat[ch] /{pattern}/	The following commands until the next |:catch|,
			|:finally|, or |:endtry| that belongs to the same
			|:try| as the ":catch" are executed when an exception
			matching {pattern} is being thrown and has not yet
			been caught by a previous ":catch".  Otherwise, these
			commands are skipped.
			When {pattern} is omitted all errors are caught.
			Examples: >
		:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/	" catch interrupts (CTRL-C)
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E/	" catch all Vim errors
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:/	" catch errors and interrupts
		:catch /^Vim(write):/		" catch all errors in :write
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E123/	" catch error E123
		:catch /my-exception/		" catch user exception
		:catch /.*/			" catch everything
		:catch				" same as /.*/
<
			Another character can be used instead of / around the
			{pattern}, so long as it does not have a special
			meaning (e.g., '|' or '"') and doesn't occur inside
			{pattern}.
			Information about the exception is available in
			|v:exception|.  Also see |throw-variables|.
			NOTE: It is not reliable to ":catch" the TEXT of
			an error message because it may vary in different
			locales.

					*:fina* *:finally* *E606* *E607*
:fina[lly]		The following commands until the matching |:endtry|
			are executed whenever the part between the matching
			|:try| and the ":finally" is left:  either by falling
			through to the ":finally" or by a |:continue|,
			|:break|, |:finish|, or |:return|, or by an error or
			interrupt or exception (see |:throw|).

							*:th* *:throw* *E608*
:th[row] {expr1}	The {expr1} is evaluated and thrown as an exception.
			If the ":throw" is used after a |:try| but before the
			first corresponding |:catch|, commands are skipped
			until the first ":catch" matching {expr1} is reached.
			If there is no such ":catch" or if the ":throw" is
			used after a ":catch" but before the |:finally|, the
			commands following the ":finally" (if present) up to
			the matching |:endtry| are executed.  If the ":throw"
			is after the ":finally", commands up to the ":endtry"
			are skipped.  At the ":endtry", this process applies
			again for the next dynamically surrounding ":try"
			(which may be found in a calling function or sourcing
			script), until a matching ":catch" has been found.
			If the exception is not caught, the command processing
			is terminated.
			Example: >
		:try | throw "oops" | catch /^oo/ | echo "caught" | endtry
<			Note that "catch" may need to be on a separate line
			for when an error causes the parsing to skip the whole
			line and not see the "|" that separates the commands.

							*:ec* *:echo*
:ec[ho] {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, with a space in between.  The
			first {expr1} starts on a new line.
			Also see |:comment|.
			Use "\n" to start a new line.  Use "\r" to move the
			cursor to the first column.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
		:echo "the value of 'shell' is" &shell
<							*:echo-redraw*
			A later redraw may make the message disappear again.
			And since Vim mostly postpones redrawing until it's
			finished with a sequence of commands this happens
			quite often.  To avoid that a command from before the
			":echo" causes a redraw afterwards (redraws are often
			postponed until you type something), force a redraw
			with the |:redraw| command.  Example: >
		:new | redraw | echo "there is a new window"
<
							*:echon*
:echon {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, without anything added.  Also see
			|:comment|.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
				:echon "the value of 'shell' is " &shell
<
			Note the difference between using ":echo", which is a
			Vim command, and ":!echo", which is an external shell
			command: >
		:!echo %		--> filename
<			The arguments of ":!" are expanded, see |:_%|. >
		:!echo "%"		--> filename or "filename"
<			Like the previous example.  Whether you see the double
			quotes or not depends on your 'shell'. >
		:echo %			--> nothing
<			The '%' is an illegal character in an expression. >
		:echo "%"		--> %
<			This just echoes the '%' character. >
		:echo expand("%")	--> filename
<			This calls the expand() function to expand the '%'.

							*:echoh* *:echohl*
:echoh[l] {name}	Use the highlight group {name} for the following
			|:echo|, |:echon| and |:echomsg| commands.  Also used
			for the |input()| prompt.  Example: >
		:echohl WarningMsg | echo "Don't panic!" | echohl None
<			Don't forget to set the group back to "None",
			otherwise all following echo's will be highlighted.

							*:echom* *:echomsg*
:echom[sg] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as a true message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			|:echo| command.  But unprintable characters are
			displayed, not interpreted.
			The parsing works slightly different from |:echo|,
			more like |:execute|.  All the expressions are first
			evaluated and concatenated before echoing anything.
			The expressions must evaluate to a Number or String, a
			Dictionary or List causes an error.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Example: >
		:echomsg "It's a Zizzer Zazzer Zuzz, as you can plainly see."
<			See |:echo-redraw| to avoid the message disappearing
			when the screen is redrawn.
							*:echoe* *:echoerr*
:echoe[rr] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as an error message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.  When used in a
			script or function the line number will be added.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			:echo command.	When used inside a try conditional,
			the message is raised as an error exception instead
			(see |try-echoerr|).
			Example: >
		:echoerr "This script just failed!"
<			If you just want a highlighted message use |:echohl|.
			And to get a beep: >
		:exe "normal \<Esc>"
<
							*:exe* *:execute*
:exe[cute] {expr1} ..	Executes the string that results from the evaluation
			of {expr1} as an Ex command.
			Multiple arguments are concatenated, with a space in
			between.  To avoid the extra space use the "."
			operator to concatenate strings into one argument.
			{expr1} is used as the processed command, command line
			editing keys are not recognized.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Examples: >
		:execute "buffer" nextbuf
		:execute "normal" count . "w"
<
			":execute" can be used to append a command to commands
			that don't accept a '|'.  Example: >
		:execute '!ls' | echo "theend"

<			":execute" is also a nice way to avoid having to type
			control characters in a Vim script for a ":normal"
			command: >
		:execute "normal ixxx\<Esc>"
<			This has an <Esc> character, see |expr-string|.

			Be careful to correctly escape special characters in
			file names.  The |fnameescape()| function can be used
			for Vim commands, |shellescape()| for |:!| commands.
			Examples: >
		:execute "e " . fnameescape(filename)
		:execute "!ls " . shellescape(filename, 1)
<
			Note: The executed string may be any command-line, but
			starting or ending "if", "while" and "for" does not
			always work, because when commands are skipped the
			":execute" is not evaluated and Vim loses track of
			where blocks start and end.  Also "break" and
			"continue" should not be inside ":execute".
			This example does not work, because the ":execute" is
			not evaluated and Vim does not see the "while", and
			gives an error for finding an ":endwhile": >
		:if 0
		: execute 'while i > 5'
		:  echo "test"
		: endwhile
		:endif
<
			It is allowed to have a "while" or "if" command
			completely in the executed string: >
		:execute 'while i < 5 | echo i | let i = i + 1 | endwhile'
<

							*:exe-comment*
			":execute", ":echo" and ":echon" cannot be followed by
			a comment directly, because they see the '"' as the
			start of a string.  But, you can use '|' followed by a
			comment.  Example: >
		:echo "foo" | "this is a comment

==============================================================================
8. Exception handling					*exception-handling*

The Vim script language comprises an exception handling feature.  This section
explains how it can be used in a Vim script.

Exceptions may be raised by Vim on an error or on interrupt, see
|catch-errors| and |catch-interrupt|.  You can also explicitly throw an
exception by using the ":throw" command, see |throw-catch|.


TRY CONDITIONALS					*try-conditionals*

Exceptions can be caught or can cause cleanup code to be executed.  You can
use a try conditional to specify catch clauses (that catch exceptions) and/or
a finally clause (to be executed for cleanup).
   A try conditional begins with a |:try| command and ends at the matching
|:endtry| command.  In between, you can use a |:catch| command to start
a catch clause, or a |:finally| command to start a finally clause.  There may
be none or multiple catch clauses, but there is at most one finally clause,
which must not be followed by any catch clauses.  The lines before the catch
clauses and the finally clause is called a try block. >

     :try
     :	...
     :	...				TRY BLOCK
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :finally
     :	...
     :	...				FINALLY CLAUSE
     :	...
     :endtry

The try conditional allows to watch code for exceptions and to take the
appropriate actions.  Exceptions from the try block may be caught.  Exceptions
from the try block and also the catch clauses may cause cleanup actions.
   When no exception is thrown during execution of the try block, the control
is transferred to the finally clause, if present.  After its execution, the
script continues with the line following the ":endtry".
   When an exception occurs during execution of the try block, the remaining
lines in the try block are skipped.  The exception is matched against the
patterns specified as arguments to the ":catch" commands.  The catch clause
after the first matching ":catch" is taken, other catch clauses are not
executed.  The catch clause ends when the next ":catch", ":finally", or
":endtry" command is reached - whatever is first.  Then, the finally clause
(if present) is executed.  When the ":endtry" is reached, the script execution
continues in the following line as usual.
   When an exception that does not match any of the patterns specified by the
":catch" commands is thrown in the try block, the exception is not caught by
that try conditional and none of the catch clauses is executed.  Only the
finally clause, if present, is taken.  The exception pends during execution of
the finally clause.  It is resumed at the ":endtry", so that commands after
the ":endtry" are not executed and the exception might be caught elsewhere,
see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of a catch clause another exception is thrown, the
remaining lines in that catch clause are not executed.	The new exception is
not matched against the patterns in any of the ":catch" commands of the same
try conditional and none of its catch clauses is taken.  If there is, however,
a finally clause, it is executed, and the exception pends during its
execution.  The commands following the ":endtry" are not executed.  The new
exception might, however, be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of the finally clause (if present) an exception is
thrown, the remaining lines in the finally clause are skipped.	If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception from the try block or one of the
catch clauses, the original (pending) exception is discarded.  The commands
following the ":endtry" are not executed, and the exception from the finally
clause is propagated and can be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.

The finally clause is also executed, when a ":break" or ":continue" for
a ":while" loop enclosing the complete try conditional is executed from the
try block or a catch clause.  Or when a ":return" or ":finish" is executed
from the try block or a catch clause of a try conditional in a function or
sourced script, respectively.  The ":break", ":continue", ":return", or
":finish" pends during execution of the finally clause and is resumed when the
":endtry" is reached.  It is, however, discarded when an exception is thrown
from the finally clause.
   When a ":break" or ":continue" for a ":while" loop enclosing the complete
try conditional or when a ":return" or ":finish" is encountered in the finally
clause, the rest of the finally clause is skipped, and the ":break",
":continue", ":return" or ":finish" is executed as usual.  If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception or an earlier ":break",
":continue", ":return", or ":finish" from the try block or a catch clause,
this pending exception or command is discarded.

For examples see |throw-catch| and |try-finally|.


NESTING	OF TRY CONDITIONALS				*try-nesting*

Try conditionals can be nested arbitrarily.  That is, a complete try
conditional can be put into the try block, a catch clause, or the finally
clause of another try conditional.  If the inner try conditional does not
catch an exception thrown in its try block or throws a new exception from one
of its catch clauses or its finally clause, the outer try conditional is
checked according to the rules above.  If the inner try conditional is in the
try block of the outer try conditional, its catch clauses are checked, but
otherwise only the finally clause is executed.	It does not matter for
nesting, whether the inner try conditional is directly contained in the outer
one, or whether the outer one sources a script or calls a function containing
the inner try conditional.

When none of the active try conditionals catches an exception, just their
finally clauses are executed.  Thereafter, the script processing terminates.
An error message is displayed in case of an uncaught exception explicitly
thrown by a ":throw" command.  For uncaught error and interrupt exceptions
implicitly raised by Vim, the error message(s) or interrupt message are shown
as usual.

For examples see |throw-catch|.


EXAMINING EXCEPTION HANDLING CODE			*except-examine*

Exception handling code can get tricky.  If you are in doubt what happens, set
'verbose' to 13 or use the ":13verbose" command modifier when sourcing your
script file.  Then you see when an exception is thrown, discarded, caught, or
finished.  When using a verbosity level of at least 14, things pending in
a finally clause are also shown.  This information is also given in debug mode
(see |debug-scripts|).


THROWING AND CATCHING EXCEPTIONS			*throw-catch*

You can throw any number or string as an exception.  Use the |:throw| command
and pass the value to be thrown as argument: >
	:throw 4711
	:throw "string"
<							*throw-expression*
You can also specify an expression argument.  The expression is then evaluated
first, and the result is thrown: >
	:throw 4705 + strlen("string")
	:throw strpart("strings", 0, 6)

An exception might be thrown during evaluation of the argument of the ":throw"
command.  Unless it is caught there, the expression evaluation is abandoned.
The ":throw" command then does not throw a new exception.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(arg)
	:  try
	:    throw a:arg
	:  catch /foo/
	:  endtry
	:  return 1
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  echo "in Bar"
	:  return 4710
	:endfunction
	:
	:throw Foo("arrgh") + Bar()

This throws "arrgh", and "in Bar" is not displayed since Bar() is not
executed. >
	:throw Foo("foo") + Bar()
however displays "in Bar" and throws 4711.

Any other command that takes an expression as argument might also be
abandoned by an (uncaught) exception during the expression evaluation.	The
exception is then propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:if Foo("arrgh")
	:  echo "then"
	:else
	:  echo "else"
	:endif

Here neither of "then" or "else" is displayed.

							*catch-order*
Exceptions can be caught by a try conditional with one or more |:catch|
commands, see |try-conditionals|.   The values to be caught by each ":catch"
command can be specified as a pattern argument.  The subsequent catch clause
gets executed when a matching exception is caught.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(value)
	:  try
	:    throw a:value
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo(0x1267)
	:call Foo('string')

The first call to Foo() displays "Number thrown", the second "String thrown".
An exception is matched against the ":catch" commands in the order they are
specified.  Only the first match counts.  So you should place the more
specific ":catch" first.  The following order does not make sense: >

	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"

The first ":catch" here matches always, so that the second catch clause is
never taken.

							*throw-variables*
If you catch an exception by a general pattern, you may access the exact value
in the variable |v:exception|: >

	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown.  Value is" v:exception

You may also be interested where an exception was thrown.  This is stored in
|v:throwpoint|.  Note that "v:exception" and "v:throwpoint" are valid for the
exception most recently caught as long it is not finished.
   Example: >

	:function! Caught()
	:  if v:exception != ""
	:    echo 'Caught "' . v:exception . '" in ' . v:throwpoint
	:  else
	:    echo 'Nothing caught'
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    try
	:      try
	:	 throw 4711
	:      finally
	:	 call Caught()
	:      endtry
	:    catch /.*/
	:      call Caught()
	:      throw "oops"
	:    endtry
	:  catch /.*/
	:    call Caught()
	:  finally
	:    call Caught()
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo()

This displays >

	Nothing caught
	Caught "4711" in function Foo, line 4
	Caught "oops" in function Foo, line 10
	Nothing caught

A practical example:  The following command ":LineNumber" displays the line
number in the script or function where it has been used: >

	:function! LineNumber()
	:    return substitute(v:throwpoint, '.*\D\(\d\+\).*', '\1', "")
	:endfunction
	:command! LineNumber try | throw "" | catch | echo LineNumber() | endtry
<
							*try-nested*
An exception that is not caught by a try conditional can be caught by
a surrounding try conditional: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw "foo"
	:  catch /foobar/
	:    echo "foobar"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch /foo/
	:  echo "foo"
	:endtry

The inner try conditional does not catch the exception, just its finally
clause is executed.  The exception is then caught by the outer try
conditional.  The example displays "inner finally" and then "foo".

							*throw-from-catch*
You can catch an exception and throw a new one to be caught elsewhere from the
catch clause: >

	:function! Foo()
	:  throw "foo"
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /foo/
	:    echo "Caught foo, throw bar"
	:    throw "bar"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:  call Bar()
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Caught" v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Caught foo, throw bar" and then "Caught bar".

							*rethrow*
There is no real rethrow in the Vim script language, but you may throw
"v:exception" instead: >

	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "Rethrow" v:exception
	:    throw v:exception
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
<							*try-echoerr*
Note that this method cannot be used to "rethrow" Vim error or interrupt
exceptions, because it is not possible to fake Vim internal exceptions.
Trying so causes an error exception.  You should throw your own exception
denoting the situation.  If you want to cause a Vim error exception containing
the original error exception value, you can use the |:echoerr| command: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    asdf
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echoerr v:exception
	:  endtry
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This code displays

	Vim(echoerr):Vim:E492: Not an editor command:	asdf ~


CLEANUP CODE						*try-finally*

Scripts often change global settings and restore them at their end.  If the
user however interrupts the script by pressing CTRL-C, the settings remain in
an inconsistent state.	The same may happen to you in the development phase of
a script when an error occurs or you explicitly throw an exception without
catching it.  You can solve these problems by using a try conditional with
a finally clause for restoring the settings.  Its execution is guaranteed on
normal control flow, on error, on an explicit ":throw", and on interrupt.
(Note that errors and interrupts from inside the try conditional are converted
to exceptions.	When not caught, they terminate the script after the finally
clause has been executed.)
Example: >

	:try
	:  let s:saved_ts = &ts
	:  set ts=17
	:
	:  " Do the hard work here.
	:
	:finally
	:  let &ts = s:saved_ts
	:  unlet s:saved_ts
	:endtry

This method should be used locally whenever a function or part of a script
changes global settings which need to be restored on failure or normal exit of
that function or script part.

							*break-finally*
Cleanup code works also when the try block or a catch clause is left by
a ":continue", ":break", ":return", or ":finish".
   Example: >

	:let first = 1
	:while 1
	:  try
	:    if first
	:      echo "first"
	:      let first = 0
	:      continue
	:    else
	:      throw "second"
	:    endif
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo v:exception
	:    break
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "still in while"
	:endwhile
	:echo "end"

This displays "first", "cleanup", "second", "cleanup", and "end". >

	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    return 4711
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup\n"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "Foo still active"
	:endfunction
	:
	:echo Foo() "returned by Foo"

This displays "cleanup" and "4711 returned by Foo".  You don't need to add an
extra ":return" in the finally clause.	(Above all, this would override the
return value.)

							*except-from-finally*
Using either of ":continue", ":break", ":return", ":finish", or ":throw" in
a finally clause is possible, but not recommended since it abandons the
cleanup actions for the try conditional.  But, of course, interrupt and error
exceptions might get raised from a finally clause.
   Example where an error in the finally clause stops an interrupt from
working correctly: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    echo "Press CTRL-C for interrupt"
	:    while 1
	:    endwhile
	:  finally
	:    unlet novar
	:  endtry
	:catch /novar/
	:endtry
	:echo "Script still running"
	:sleep 1

If you need to put commands that could fail into a finally clause, you should
think about catching or ignoring the errors in these commands, see
|catch-errors| and |ignore-errors|.


CATCHING ERRORS						*catch-errors*

If you want to catch specific errors, you just have to put the code to be
watched in a try block and add a catch clause for the error message.  The
presence of the try conditional causes all errors to be converted to an
exception.  No message is displayed and |v:errmsg| is not set then.  To find
the right pattern for the ":catch" command, you have to know how the format of
the error exception is.
   Error exceptions have the following format: >

	Vim({cmdname}):{errmsg}
or >
	Vim:{errmsg}

{cmdname} is the name of the command that failed; the second form is used when
the command name is not known.	{errmsg} is the error message usually produced
when the error occurs outside try conditionals.  It always begins with
a capital "E", followed by a two or three-digit error number, a colon, and
a space.

Examples:

The command >
	:unlet novar
normally produces the error message >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(unlet):E108: No such variable: "novar"

The command >
	:dwim
normally produces the error message >
	E492: Not an editor command: dwim
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim:E492: Not an editor command: dwim

You can catch all ":unlet" errors by a >
	:catch /^Vim(unlet):/
or all errors for misspelled command names by a >
	:catch /^Vim:E492:/

Some error messages may be produced by different commands: >
	:function nofunc
and >
	:delfunction nofunc
both produce the error message >
	E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(function):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
or >
	Vim(delfunction):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
respectively.  You can catch the error by its number independently on the
command that caused it if you use the following pattern: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E128:/

Some commands like >
	:let x = novar
produce multiple error messages, here: >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression:  novar
Only the first is used for the exception value, since it is the most specific
one (see |except-several-errors|).  So you can catch it by >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E121:/

You can catch all errors related to the name "nofunc" by >
	:catch /\<nofunc\>/

You can catch all Vim errors in the ":write" and ":read" commands by >
	:catch /^Vim(\(write\|read\)):E\d\+:/

You can catch all Vim errors by the pattern >
	:catch /^Vim\((\a\+)\)\=:E\d\+:/
<
							*catch-text*
NOTE: You should never catch the error message text itself: >
	:catch /No such variable/
only works in the english locale, but not when the user has selected
a different language by the |:language| command.  It is however helpful to
cite the message text in a comment: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E108:/   " No such variable


IGNORING ERRORS						*ignore-errors*

You can ignore errors in a specific Vim command by catching them locally: >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:endtry

But you are strongly recommended NOT to use this simple form, since it could
catch more than you want.  With the ":write" command, some autocommands could
be executed and cause errors not related to writing, for instance: >

	:au BufWritePre * unlet novar

There could even be such errors you are not responsible for as a script
writer: a user of your script might have defined such autocommands.  You would
then hide the error from the user.
   It is much better to use >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:endtry

which only catches real write errors.  So catch only what you'd like to ignore
intentionally.

For a single command that does not cause execution of autocommands, you could
even suppress the conversion of errors to exceptions by the ":silent!"
command: >
	:silent! nunmap k
This works also when a try conditional is active.


CATCHING INTERRUPTS					*catch-interrupt*

When there are active try conditionals, an interrupt (CTRL-C) is converted to
the exception "Vim:Interrupt".	You can catch it like every exception.	The
script is not terminated, then.
   Example: >

	:function! TASK1()
	:  sleep 10
	:endfunction

	:function! TASK2()
	:  sleep 20
	:endfunction

	:while 1
	:  let command = input("Type a command: ")
	:  try
	:    if command == ""
	:      continue
	:    elseif command == "END"
	:      break
	:    elseif command == "TASK1"
	:      call TASK1()
	:    elseif command == "TASK2"
	:      call TASK2()
	:    else
	:      echo "\nIllegal command:" command
	:      continue
	:    endif
	:  catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "\nCommand interrupted"
	:    " Caught the interrupt.  Continue with next prompt.
	:  endtry
	:endwhile

You can interrupt a task here by pressing CTRL-C; the script then asks for
a new command.	If you press CTRL-C at the prompt, the script is terminated.

For testing what happens when CTRL-C would be pressed on a specific line in
your script, use the debug mode and execute the |>quit| or |>interrupt|
command on that line.  See |debug-scripts|.


CATCHING ALL						*catch-all*

The commands >

	:catch /.*/
	:catch //
	:catch

catch everything, error exceptions, interrupt exceptions and exceptions
explicitly thrown by the |:throw| command.  This is useful at the top level of
a script in order to catch unexpected things.
   Example: >

	:try
	:
	:  " do the hard work here
	:
	:catch /MyException/
	:
	:  " handle known problem
	:
	:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "Script interrupted"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Internal error (" . v:exception . ")"
	:  echo " - occurred at " . v:throwpoint
	:endtry
	:" end of script

Note: Catching all might catch more things than you want.  Thus, you are
strongly encouraged to catch only for problems that you can really handle by
specifying a pattern argument to the ":catch".
   Example: Catching all could make it nearly impossible to interrupt a script
by pressing CTRL-C: >

	:while 1
	:  try
	:    sleep 1
	:  catch
	:  endtry
	:endwhile


EXCEPTIONS AND AUTOCOMMANDS				*except-autocmd*

Exceptions may be used during execution of autocommands.  Example: >

	:autocmd User x try
	:autocmd User x   throw "Oops!"
	:autocmd User x catch
	:autocmd User x   echo v:exception
	:autocmd User x endtry
	:autocmd User x throw "Arrgh!"
	:autocmd User x echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  doautocmd User x
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Oops!" and "Arrgh!".

							*except-autocmd-Pre*
For some commands, autocommands get executed before the main action of the
command takes place.  If an exception is thrown and not caught in the sequence
of autocommands, the sequence and the command that caused its execution are
abandoned and the exception is propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre * throw "FAIL"
	:autocmd BufWritePre * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo "Caught:" v:exception "from" v:throwpoint
	:endtry

Here, the ":write" command does not write the file currently being edited (as
you can see by checking 'modified'), since the exception from the BufWritePre
autocommand abandons the ":write".  The exception is then caught and the
script displays: >

	Caught: FAIL from BufWrite Auto commands for "*"
<
							*except-autocmd-Post*
For some commands, autocommands get executed after the main action of the
command has taken place.  If this main action fails and the command is inside
an active try conditional, the autocommands are skipped and an error exception
is thrown that can be caught by the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "File successfully written!"
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This just displays: >

	Vim(write):E212: Can't open file for writing (/i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e)

If you really need to execute the autocommands even when the main action
fails, trigger the event from the catch clause.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * set noreadonly
	:autocmd BufWritePost * set readonly
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  doautocmd BufWritePost /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:endtry
<
You can also use ":silent!": >

	:let x = "ok"
	:let v:errmsg = ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost * if v:errmsg != ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   let x = "after fail"
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endif
	:try
	:  silent! write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:endtry
	:echo x

This displays "after fail".

If the main action of the command does not fail, exceptions from the
autocommands will be catchable by the caller of the command:  >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * throw ":-("
	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry
<
							*except-autocmd-Cmd*
For some commands, the normal action can be replaced by a sequence of
autocommands.  Exceptions from that sequence will be catchable by the caller
of the command.
   Example:  For the ":write" command, the caller cannot know whether the file
had actually been written when the exception occurred.	You need to tell it in
some way. >

	:if !exists("cnt")
	:  let cnt = 0
	:
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * if &modified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   let cnt = cnt + 1
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 2
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   write | set nomodified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 0
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   echo "File successfully written!"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * endif
	:endif
	:
	:try
	:	write
	:catch /^BufWriteCmdError$/
	:  if &modified
	:    echo "Error on writing (file contents not changed)"
	:  else
	:    echo "Error after writing"
	:  endif
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    echo "Error on writing"
	:endtry

When this script is sourced several times after making changes, it displays
first >
	File successfully written!
then >
	Error on writing (file contents not changed)
then >
	Error after writing
etc.

							*except-autocmd-ill*
You cannot spread a try conditional over autocommands for different events.
The following code is ill-formed: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * try
	:
	:autocmd BufWritePost * catch
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   echo v:exception
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endtry
	:
	:write


EXCEPTION HIERARCHIES AND PARAMETERIZED EXCEPTIONS	*except-hier-param*

Some programming languages allow to use hierarchies of exception classes or to
pass additional information with the object of an exception class.  You can do
similar things in Vim.
   In order to throw an exception from a hierarchy, just throw the complete
class name with the components separated by a colon, for instance throw the
string "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW" for an overflow in a mathematical library.
   When you want to pass additional information with your exception class, add
it in parentheses, for instance throw the string "EXCEPT:IO:WRITEERR(myfile)"
for an error when writing "myfile".
   With the appropriate patterns in the ":catch" command, you can catch for
base classes or derived classes of your hierarchy.  Additional information in
parentheses can be cut out from |v:exception| with the ":substitute" command.
   Example: >

	:function! CheckRange(a, func)
	:  if a:a < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE(" . a:func . ")"
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Add(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Add")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Add")
	:  let c = a:a + a:b
	:  if c < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW"
	:  endif
	:  return c
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Div(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Div")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Div")
	:  if (a:b == 0)
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:ZERODIV"
	:  endif
	:  return a:a / a:b
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Write(file)
	:  try
	:    execute "write" fnameescape(a:file)
	:  catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    throw "EXCEPT:IO(" . getcwd() . ", " . a:file . "):WRITEERR"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:
	:  " something with arithmetics and I/O
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE/
	:  let function = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(\a\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  echo "Range error in" function
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR/	" catches OVERFLOW and ZERODIV
	:  echo "Math error"
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:IO/
	:  let dir = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(.\+\),\s*.\+).*', '\1', "")
	:  let file = substitute(v:exception, '.*(.\+,\s*\(.\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  if file !~ '^/'
	:    let file = dir . "/" . file
	:  endif
	:  echo 'I/O error for "' . file . '"'
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT/
	:  echo "Unspecified error"
	:
	:endtry

The exceptions raised by Vim itself (on error or when pressing CTRL-C) use
a flat hierarchy:  they are all in the "Vim" class.  You cannot throw yourself
exceptions with the "Vim" prefix; they are reserved for Vim.
   Vim error exceptions are parameterized with the name of the command that
failed, if known.  See |catch-errors|.


PECULIARITIES
							*except-compat*
The exception handling concept requires that the command sequence causing the
exception is aborted immediately and control is transferred to finally clauses
and/or a catch clause.

In the Vim script language there are cases where scripts and functions
continue after an error: in functions without the "abort" flag or in a command
after ":silent!", control flow goes to the following line, and outside
functions, control flow goes to the line following the outermost ":endwhile"
or ":endif".  On the other hand, errors should be catchable as exceptions
(thus, requiring the immediate abortion).

This problem has been solved by converting errors to exceptions and using
immediate abortion (if not suppressed by ":silent!") only when a try
conditional is active.	This is no restriction since an (error) exception can
be caught only from an active try conditional.	If you want an immediate
termination without catching the error, just use a try conditional without
catch clause.  (You can cause cleanup code being executed before termination
by specifying a finally clause.)

When no try conditional is active, the usual abortion and continuation
behavior is used instead of immediate abortion.  This ensures compatibility of
scripts written for Vim 6.1 and earlier.

However, when sourcing an existing script that does not use exception handling
commands (or when calling one of its functions) from inside an active try
conditional of a new script, you might change the control flow of the existing
script on error.  You get the immediate abortion on error and can catch the
error in the new script.  If however the sourced script suppresses error
messages by using the ":silent!" command (checking for errors by testing
|v:errmsg| if appropriate), its execution path is not changed.	The error is
not converted to an exception.	(See |:silent|.)  So the only remaining cause
where this happens is for scripts that don't care about errors and produce
error messages.  You probably won't want to use such code from your new
scripts.

							*except-syntax-err*
Syntax errors in the exception handling commands are never caught by any of
the ":catch" commands of the try conditional they belong to.  Its finally
clauses, however, is executed.
   Example: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw 4711
	:  catch /\(/
	:    echo "in catch with syntax error"
	:  catch
	:    echo "inner catch-all"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch
	:  echo 'outer catch-all caught "' . v:exception . '"'
	:  finally
	:    echo "outer finally"
	:endtry

This displays: >
    inner finally
    outer catch-all caught "Vim(catch):E54: Unmatched \("
    outer finally
The original exception is discarded and an error exception is raised, instead.

							*except-single-line*
The ":try", ":catch", ":finally", and ":endtry" commands can be put on
a single line, but then syntax errors may make it difficult to recognize the
"catch" line, thus you better avoid this.
   Example: >
	:try | unlet! foo # | catch | endtry
raises an error exception for the trailing characters after the ":unlet!"
argument, but does not see the ":catch" and ":endtry" commands, so that the
error exception is discarded and the "E488: Trailing characters" message gets
displayed.

							*except-several-errors*
When several errors appear in a single command, the first error message is
usually the most specific one and therefor converted to the error exception.
   Example: >
	echo novar
causes >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression: novar
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(echo):E121: Undefined variable: novar
<							*except-syntax-error*
But when a syntax error is detected after a normal error in the same command,
the syntax error is used for the exception being thrown.
   Example: >
	unlet novar #
causes >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
	E488: Trailing characters
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters
This is done because the syntax error might change the execution path in a way
not intended by the user.  Example: >
	try
	    try | unlet novar # | catch | echo v:exception | endtry
	catch /.*/
	    echo "outer catch:" v:exception
	endtry
This displays "outer catch: Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters", and then
a "E600: Missing :endtry" error message is given, see |except-single-line|.

9. Examples						*eval-examples*

Printing in Binary ~
>
  :" The function Nr2Bin() returns the binary string representation of a number.
  :func Nr2Bin(nr)
  :  let n = a:nr
  :  let r = ""
  :  while n
  :    let r = '01'[n % 2] . r
  :    let n = n / 2
  :  endwhile
  :  return r
  :endfunc

  :" The function String2Bin() converts each character in a string to a
  :" binary string, separated with dashes.
  :func String2Bin(str)
  :  let out = ''
  :  for ix in range(strlen(a:str))
  :    let out = out . '-' . Nr2Bin(char2nr(a:str[ix]))
  :  endfor
  :  return out[1:]
  :endfunc

Example of its use: >
  :echo Nr2Bin(32)
result: "100000" >
  :echo String2Bin("32")
result: "110011-110010"


Sorting lines ~

This example sorts lines with a specific compare function. >

  :func SortBuffer()
  :  let lines = getline(1, '$')
  :  call sort(lines, function("Strcmp"))
  :  call setline(1, lines)
  :endfunction

As a one-liner: >
  :call setline(1, sort(getline(1, '$'), function("Strcmp")))


scanf() replacement ~
							*sscanf*
There is no sscanf() function in Vim.  If you need to extract parts from a
line, you can use matchstr() and substitute() to do it.  This example shows
how to get the file name, line number and column number out of a line like
"foobar.txt, 123, 45". >
   :" Set up the match bit
   :let mx='\(\f\+\),\s*\(\d\+\),\s*\(\d\+\)'
   :"get the part matching the whole expression
   :let l = matchstr(line, mx)
   :"get each item out of the match
   :let file = substitute(l, mx, '\1', '')
   :let lnum = substitute(l, mx, '\2', '')
   :let col = substitute(l, mx, '\3', '')

The input is in the variable "line", the results in the variables "file",
"lnum" and "col". (idea from Michael Geddes)


getting the scriptnames in a Dictionary ~
						*scriptnames-dictionary*
The |:scriptnames| command can be used to get a list of all script files that
have been sourced.  There is no equivalent function or variable for this
(because it's rarely needed).  In case you need to manipulate the list this
code can be used: >
    " Get the output of ":scriptnames" in the scriptnames_output variable.
    let scriptnames_output = ''
    redir => scriptnames_output
    silent scriptnames
    redir END
    
    " Split the output into lines and parse each line.	Add an entry to the
    " "scripts" dictionary.
    let scripts = {}
    for line in split(scriptnames_output, "\n")
      " Only do non-blank lines.
      if line =~ '\S'
	" Get the first number in the line.
	let nr = matchstr(line, '\d\+')
	" Get the file name, remove the script number " 123: ".
	let name = substitute(line, '.\+:\s*', '', '')
	" Add an item to the Dictionary
	let scripts[nr] = name
      endif
    endfor
    unlet scriptnames_output

==============================================================================
10. No +eval feature				*no-eval-feature*

When the |+eval| feature was disabled at compile time, none of the expression
evaluation commands are available.  To prevent this from causing Vim scripts
to generate all kinds of errors, the ":if" and ":endif" commands are still
recognized, though the argument of the ":if" and everything between the ":if"
and the matching ":endif" is ignored.  Nesting of ":if" blocks is allowed, but
only if the commands are at the start of the line.  The ":else" command is not
recognized.

Example of how to avoid executing commands when the |+eval| feature is
missing: >

	:if 1
	:  echo "Expression evaluation is compiled in"
	:else
	:  echo "You will _never_ see this message"
	:endif

==============================================================================
11. The sandbox					*eval-sandbox* *sandbox* *E48*

The 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr', 'includeexpr', 'indentexpr', 'statusline' and
'foldtext' options may be evaluated in a sandbox.  This means that you are
protected from these expressions having nasty side effects.  This gives some
safety for when these options are set from a modeline.  It is also used when
the command from a tags file is executed and for CTRL-R = in the command line.
The sandbox is also used for the |:sandbox| command.

These items are not allowed in the sandbox:
	- changing the buffer text
	- defining or changing mapping, autocommands, functions, user commands
	- setting certain options (see |option-summary|)
	- setting certain v: variables (see |v:var|)  *E794*
	- executing a shell command
	- reading or writing a file
	- jumping to another buffer or editing a file
	- executing Python, Perl, etc. commands
This is not guaranteed 100% secure, but it should block most attacks.

							*:san* *:sandbox*
:san[dbox] {cmd}	Execute {cmd} in the sandbox.  Useful to evaluate an
			option that may have been set from a modeline, e.g.
			'foldexpr'.

							*sandbox-option*
A few options contain an expression.  When this expression is evaluated it may
have to be done in the sandbox to avoid a security risk.  But the sandbox is
restrictive, thus this only happens when the option was set from an insecure
location.  Insecure in this context are:
- sourcing a .vimrc or .exrc in the current directory
- while executing in the sandbox
- value coming from a modeline

Note that when in the sandbox and saving an option value and restoring it, the
option will still be marked as it was set in the sandbox.

==============================================================================
12. Textlock							*textlock*

In a few situations it is not allowed to change the text in the buffer, jump
to another window and some other things that might confuse or break what Vim
is currently doing.  This mostly applies to things that happen when Vim is
actually doing something else.	For example, evaluating the 'balloonexpr' may
happen any moment the mouse cursor is resting at some position.

This is not allowed when the textlock is active:
	- changing the buffer text
	- jumping to another buffer or window
	- editing another file
	- closing a window or quitting Vim

Right to Left and Farsi Mapping for Vim		*farsi* *Farsi*

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

						*E27*
In order to use right-to-left and Farsi mapping support, it is necessary to
compile Vim with the |+farsi| feature.

These functions have been made by Mortaza G. Shiran <shiran@jps.net>


Introduction
------------
In right-to-left oriented files the characters appear on the screen from right
to left.  This kind of file is most useful when writing Farsi documents,
composing faxes or writing Farsi memos.

The commands, prompts and help files are not in Farsi, therefore the user
interface remains the standard Vi interface.


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim, no change.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.   File orientation is
   per window, so it is possible to view the same file in right-to-left and
   left-to-right modes, simultaneously.

o  Compatibility to the original Vim.   Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (see bugs below).

o  Changing keyboard mapping and reverse insert modes using a single
   command.

o  Backing from reverse insert mode to the correct place in the file
   (if possible).

o  While in Farsi mode, numbers are entered from left to right.  Upon entering
   a none number character, that character will be inserted just into the
   left of the last number.

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.  The
   right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.  Only
   Farsi font is necessary.

o  Farsi keymapping on the command line in reverse insert mode.

o  Toggling between left-to-right and right-to-left via F8 function key.

o  Toggling between Farsi ISIR-3342 standard encoding and Vim Farsi via F9
   function key.  Since this makes sense only for the text written in
   right-to-left mode, this function is also supported only in right-to-left
   mode.

Farsi Fonts					*farsi fonts*
-----------

The following files are found in the subdirectories of the '$VIM/farsi/fonts'
directory:

   +  far-a01.pcf    X Windows fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.bf     X Windows fonts for SunOS
   +  far-a01.f16    a screen fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.fon    a monospaced fonts for Windows NT/95/98
   +  far-a01.com    a screen fonts for DOS


Font Installation
-----------------

o  Installation of fonts for MS Window systems (NT/95/98)

   From 'Control Panel' folder, start the 'Fonts' program.  Then from 'file'
   menu item select 'Install New Fonts ...'.  Browse and select the
   'far-a01.fon', then follow the installation guide.
   NOTE: several people have reported that this does not work.  The solution
   is unknown.

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (Unix/Linux)

   Depending on your system, copy far-a01.pcf.Z or far-a01.pcf.gz into a
   directory of your choice.  Change to the directory containing the Farsi
   fonts and execute the following commands:

   >  mkfontdir
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_farsi_fonts_directory

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (SunOS)

   Copy far-a01.bf font into a directory of your choice.
   Change to the directory containing the far-a01.fb fonts and
   execute the following commands:

   >  fldfamily
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_fonts_directory

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (Unix/Linux)

   For Linux system, copy the far-a01.f16 fonts into /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts
   directory and execute the setfont program as "setfont far-a01.f16".  For
   other systems (e.g. SCO Unix), please refer to the fonts installation
   section of your system administration manuals.

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (DOS)

   After system power on, prior to the first use of Vim, upload the Farsi
   fonts by executing the far-a01.com font uploading program.


Usage
-----
Prior to starting Vim, the environment in which Vim can run in Farsi mode,
must be set.  In addition to installation of Farsi fonts, following points
refer to some of the system environments, which you may need to set:
Key code mapping, loading graphic card in ASCII screen mode, setting the IO
driver in 8 bit clean mode ... .

o  Setting the Farsi fonts

   +  For Vim GUI set the 'guifont' to far-a01.  This is done by entering
      ':set guifont=far-a01' in the Vim window.

      You can have 'guifont' set to far-a01 by Vim during the Vim startup
      by appending the ':set guifont=far-a01' into your .vimrc file
      (in case of NT/95/98 platforms _vimrc).

      Under the X Window environment, you can also start Vim with the
      '-fn far-a01' option.

   +  For Vim within a xterm, start a xterm with the Farsi fonts (e.g.
      kterm -fn far-a01).  Then start Vim inside the kterm.

   +  For Vim under DOS, prior to the first usage of Vim, upload the Farsi
      fonts by executing the far-a01.com fonts uploading program.

o  Farsi Keymapping Activation

   To activate the Farsi keymapping, set either 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap'.
   This is done by entering ':set akm' or ':set fk' in the Vim window.
   You can have 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap' set as default by appending ':set akm'
   or ':set fk' in your .vimrc file or _vimrc in case of NT/95/98 platforms.

   To turn off the Farsi keymapping as a default second language keymapping,
   reset the 'altkeymap' by entering ':set noakm'.

o  right-to-left Farsi Mode

   By default Vim starts in Left-to-right mode.  Following are ways to change
   the window orientation:

   + Start Vim with the -F option (e.g. vim -F ...).

   + Use the F8 function key to toggle between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   + While in Left-to-right mode, enter 'set rl' in the command line ('rl' is
     the abbreviation for rightleft).

   + Put the 'set rl' line in your '.vimrc' file to start Vim in
     right-to-left mode permanently.

Encoding
--------

The letter encoding used is the Vim extended ISIR-3342 standard with a built
in function to convert between Vim extended ISIR-3342 and ISIR-3342 standard.

For document portability reasons, the letter encoding is kept the same across
different platforms (i.e. UNIX's, NT/95/98, MS DOS, ...).


o  Keyboard

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles between Farsi(akm)/Latin
      mode as follows:

   +  CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text in edit mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping between Farsi(akm)/
      Latin.  The Farsi text is then entered in reverse insert mode.

   +  F8 - Toggles between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   +  F9 - Toggles the encoding between ISIR-3342 standard and Vim extended
      ISIR-3342 (supported only in right-to-left mode).

   +  Keyboard mapping is based on the Iranian ISIRI-2901 standard.
      Following table shows the keyboard mapping while Farsi(akm) mode set:

	-------------------------------------
	`  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =
	                        
	-------------------------------------
	~  !  @  #  $  %  ^  &  *  (  )  _  +
	~                        
	-------------------------------------
	q  w  e  r  t  z  u  i  o  p  [  ]
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	Q  W  E  R  T  Z  U  I  O  P  {  }
	                [  ]  {  }
	-------------------------------------
	a  s  d  f  g  h  j  k  l  ;  '  \
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  :  "  |
	                     
	-------------------------------------
	<  y  x  c  v  b  n  m  ,  .  /
	                    
	-------------------------------------
	>  Y  X  C  V  B  N  M  <  >  ?
	                    
	-------------------------------------

Note:
	  stands for Farsi PSP (break without space)

	  stands for Farsi PCN (for HAMZE attribute )

Restrictions
------------

o  In insert/replace mode and fkmap (Farsi mode) set, CTRL-B is not
   supported.

o  If you change the character mapping between Latin/Farsi, the redo buffer
   will be reset (emptied).  That is, redo is valid and will function (using
   '.') only within the mode you are in.

o  While numbers are entered in Farsi mode, the redo buffer will be reset
   (emptied).  That is, you cannot redo the last changes (using '.') after
   entering numbers.

o  While in left-to-right mode and Farsi mode set, CTRL-R is not supported.

o  While in right-to-left mode, the search on 'Latin' pattern does not work,
   except if you enter the Latin search pattern in reverse.

o  In command mode there is no support for entering numbers from left
   to right and also for the sake of flexibility the keymapping logic is
   restricted.

o  Under the X Window environment, if you want to run Vim within a xterm
   terminal emulator and Farsi mode set, you need to have an ANSI compatible
   xterm terminal emulator.  This is because the letter codes above 128 decimal
   have certain meanings in the standard xterm terminal emulator.

   Note: Under X Window environment, Vim GUI works fine in Farsi mode.
	 This eliminates the need of any xterm terminal emulator.


Bugs
----
While in insert/replace and Farsi mode set, if you repeatedly change the
cursor position (via cursor movement) and enter new text and then try to undo
the last change, the undo will lag one change behind.  But as you continue to
undo, you will reach the original line of text.  You can also use U to undo all
changes made in the current line.

For more information about the bugs refer to rileft.txt.

Filetypes						*filetype* *file-type*

1. Filetypes					|filetypes|
2. Filetype plugin				|filetype-plugins|
3. Docs for the default filetype plugins.	|ftplugin-docs|

Also see |autocmd.txt|.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Filetypes					*filetypes* *file-types*

Vim can detect the type of file that is edited.  This is done by checking the
file name and sometimes by inspecting the contents of the file for specific
text.

							*:filetype* *:filet*
To enable file type detection, use this command in your vimrc: >
	:filetype on
Each time a new or existing file is edited, Vim will try to recognize the type
of the file and set the 'filetype' option.  This will trigger the FileType
event, which can be used to set the syntax highlighting, set options, etc.

NOTE: Filetypes and 'compatible' don't work together well, since being Vi
compatible means options are global.  Resetting 'compatible' is recommended,
if you didn't do that already.

Detail: The ":filetype on" command will load one of these files:
		Amiga	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
		Mac	    $VIMRUNTIME:filetype.vim
		MS-DOS	    $VIMRUNTIME\filetype.vim
		RiscOS	    Vim:Filetype
		Unix	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
		VMS	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
	This file is a Vim script that defines autocommands for the
	BufNewFile and BufRead events.  If the file type is not found by the
	name, the file $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim is used to detect it from the
	contents of the file.
	When the GUI is running or will start soon, the menu.vim script is
	also sourced.  See |'go-M'| about avoiding that.

To add your own file types, see |new-filetype| below.  To search for help on a
filetype prepend "ft-" and optionally append "-syntax", "-indent" or
"-plugin".  For example: >
	:help ft-vim-indent
	:help ft-vim-syntax
	:help ft-man-plugin

If the file type is not detected automatically, or it finds the wrong type,
you can either set the 'filetype' option manually, or add a modeline to your
file.  Example, for an IDL file use the command: >
	:set filetype=idl

or add this |modeline| to the file:
	/* vim: set filetype=idl : */ ~

						*:filetype-plugin-on*
You can enable loading the plugin files for specific file types with: >
	:filetype plugin on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "ftplugin.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its plugin file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |filetype-plugin|

						*:filetype-plugin-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype plugin off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the plugins will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "ftplugof.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

						*:filetype-indent-on*
You can enable loading the indent file for specific file types with: >
	:filetype indent on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "indent.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its indent file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |indent-expression|

						*:filetype-indent-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype indent off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the indent files will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "indoff.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
This disables auto-indenting for files you will open.  It will keep working in
already opened files.  Reset 'autoindent', 'cindent', 'smartindent' and/or
'indentexpr' to disable indenting in an opened file.

						*:filetype-off*
To disable file type detection, use this command: >
	:filetype off
This will keep the flags for "plugin" and "indent", but since no file types
are being detected, they won't work until the next ":filetype on".


Overview:					*:filetype-overview*

command				detection	plugin		indent ~
:filetype on			on		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype off			off		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype plugin on		on		on		unchanged
:filetype plugin off		unchanged	off		unchanged
:filetype indent on		on		unchanged	on
:filetype indent off		unchanged	unchanged	off
:filetype plugin indent on	on		on		on
:filetype plugin indent off	unchanged	off		off

To see the current status, type: >
	:filetype
The output looks something like this: >
	filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON  indent:OFF

The file types are also used for syntax highlighting.  If the ":syntax on"
command is used, the file type detection is installed too.  There is no need
to do ":filetype on" after ":syntax on".

To disable one of the file types, add a line in your filetype file, see
|remove-filetype|.

							*filetype-detect*
To detect the file type again: >
	:filetype detect
Use this if you started with an empty file and typed text that makes it
possible to detect the file type.  For example, when you entered this in a
shell script: "#!/bin/csh".
   When filetype detection was off, it will be enabled first, like the "on"
argument was used.

							*filetype-overrule*
When the same extension is used for two filetypes, Vim tries to guess what
kind of file it is.  This doesn't always work.  A number of global variables
can be used to overrule the filetype used for certain extensions:

	file name	variable ~
	*.asa		g:filetype_asa	|ft-aspvbs-syntax| |ft-aspperl-syntax|
	*.asp		g:filetype_asp	|ft-aspvbs-syntax| |ft-aspperl-syntax|
	*.asm		g:asmsyntax	|ft-asm-syntax|
	*.prg		g:filetype_prg
	*.pl		g:filetype_pl
	*.inc		g:filetype_inc
	*.w		g:filetype_w	|ft-cweb-syntax|
	*.i		g:filetype_i	|ft-progress-syntax|
	*.p		g:filetype_p	|ft-pascal-syntax|
	*.sh		g:bash_is_sh	|ft-sh-syntax|
	*.tex		g:tex_flavor	|ft-tex-plugin|

							*filetype-ignore*
To avoid that certain files are being inspected, the g:ft_ignore_pat variable
is used.  The default value is set like this: >
	:let g:ft_ignore_pat = '\.\(Z\|gz\|bz2\|zip\|tgz\)$'
This means that the contents of compressed files are not inspected.

							*new-filetype*
If a file type that you want to use is not detected yet, there are four ways
to add it.  In any way, it's better not to modify the $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
file.  It will be overwritten when installing a new version of Vim.

A. If you want to overrule all default file type checks.
   This works by writing one file for each filetype.  The disadvantage is that
   means there can be many files.  The advantage is that you can simply drop
   this file in the right directory to make it work.
							*ftdetect*
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Then create the directory "ftdetect"
      inside it.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
	:!mkdir ~/.vim/ftdetect
<
   2. Create a file that contains an autocommand to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		set filetype=mine
<     Note that there is no "augroup" command, this has already been done
      when sourcing your file.  You could also use the pattern "*" and then
      check the contents of the file to recognize it.
      Write this file as "mine.vim" in the "ftdetect" directory in your user
      runtime directory.  For example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/ftdetect/mine.vim

<  3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   The files in the "ftdetect" directory are used after all the default
   checks, thus they can overrule a previously detected file type.  But you
   can also use |:setfiletype| to keep a previously detected filetype.

B. If you want to detect your file after the default file type checks.

   This works like A above, but instead of setting 'filetype' unconditionally
   use ":setfiletype".  This will only set 'filetype' if no file type was
   detected yet.  Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt		setfiletype text
<
   You can also use the already detected file type in your command.  For
   example, to use the file type "mypascal" when "pascal" has been detected: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *		if &ft == 'pascal' | set ft=mypascal
								       | endif

C. If your file type can be detected by the file name.
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
<
   2. Create a file that contains autocommands to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	" my filetype file
	if exists("did_load_filetypes")
	  finish
	endif
	augroup filetypedetect
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		setfiletype mine
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.xyz		setfiletype drawing
	augroup END
<     Write this file as "filetype.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/filetype.vim

<  3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   Your filetype.vim will be sourced before the default FileType autocommands
   have been installed.  Your autocommands will match first, and the
   ":setfiletype" command will make sure that no other autocommands will set
   'filetype' after this.
							*new-filetype-scripts*
D. If your filetype can only be detected by inspecting the contents of the
   file.

   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
<
   2. Create a vim script file for doing this.  Example: >
	if did_filetype()	" filetype already set..
	  finish		" ..don't do these checks
	endif
	if getline(1) =~ '^#!.*\<mine\>'
	  setfiletype mine
	elseif getline(1) =~? '\<drawing\>'
	  setfiletype drawing
	endif
<     See $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim for more examples.
      Write this file as "scripts.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/scripts.vim
<
   3. The detection will work right away, no need to restart Vim.

   Your scripts.vim is loaded before the default checks for file types, which
   means that your rules override the default rules in
   $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim.

						*remove-filetype*
If a file type is detected that is wrong for you, install a filetype.vim or
scripts.vim to catch it (see above).  You can set 'filetype' to a non-existing
name to avoid that it will be set later anyway: >
	:set filetype=ignored

If you are setting up a system with many users, and you don't want each user
to add/remove the same filetypes, consider writing the filetype.vim and
scripts.vim files in a runtime directory that is used for everybody.  Check
the 'runtimepath' for a directory to use.  If there isn't one, set
'runtimepath' in the |system-vimrc|.  Be careful to keep the default
directories!


						*autocmd-osfiletypes*
NOTE: this code is currently disabled, as the RISC OS implementation was
removed.  In the future this will use the 'filetype' option.

On operating systems which support storing a file type with the file, you can
specify that an autocommand should only be executed if the file is of a
certain type.

The actual type checking depends on which platform you are running Vim
on; see your system's documentation for details.

To use osfiletype checking in an autocommand you should put a list of types to
match in angle brackets in place of a pattern, like this: >

	:au BufRead *.html,<&faf;HTML>  runtime! syntax/html.vim

This will match:

- Any file whose name ends in ".html"
- Any file whose type is "&faf" or "HTML", where the meaning of these types
  depends on which version of Vim you are using.
  Unknown types are considered NOT to match.

You can also specify a type and a pattern at the same time (in which case they
must both match): >

	:au BufRead <&fff>diff*

This will match files of type "&fff" whose names start with "diff".


							*plugin-details*
The "plugin" directory can be in any of the directories in the 'runtimepath'
option.  All of these directories will be searched for plugins and they are
all loaded.  For example, if this command: >

	set runtimepath

produces this output:

	runtimepath=/etc/vim,~/.vim,/usr/local/share/vim/vim60 ~

then Vim will load all plugins in these directories and below:

	/etc/vim/plugin/  ~
	~/.vim/plugin/  ~
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim60/plugin/  ~

Note that the last one is the value of $VIMRUNTIME which has been expanded.

What if it looks like your plugin is not being loaded?  You can find out what
happens when Vim starts up by using the |-V| argument: >

	vim -V2

You will see a lot of messages, in between them is a remark about loading the
plugins.  It starts with:

	Searching for "plugin/**/*.vim" in ~

There you can see where Vim looks for your plugin scripts.

2. Filetype plugin					*filetype-plugins*

When loading filetype plugins has been enabled |:filetype-plugin-on|, options
will be set and mappings defined.  These are all local to the buffer, they
will not be used for other files.

Defining mappings for a filetype may get in the way of the mappings you
define yourself.  There are a few ways to avoid this:
1. Set the "maplocalleader" variable to the key sequence you want the mappings
   to start with.  Example: >
	:let maplocalleader = ","
<  All mappings will then start with a comma instead of the default, which
   is a backslash.  Also see |<LocalLeader>|.

2. Define your own mapping.  Example: >
	:map ,p <Plug>MailQuote
<  You need to check the description of the plugin file below for the
   functionality it offers and the string to map to.
   You need to define your own mapping before the plugin is loaded (before
   editing a file of that type).  The plugin will then skip installing the
   default mapping.

3. Disable defining mappings for a specific filetype by setting a variable,
   which contains the name of the filetype.  For the "mail" filetype this
   would be: >
	:let no_mail_maps = 1

4. Disable defining mappings for all filetypes by setting a variable: >
	:let no_plugin_maps = 1
<

							*ftplugin-overrule*
If a global filetype plugin does not do exactly what you want, there are three
ways to change this:

1. Add a few settings.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory early in
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.vim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  You can set those settings and mappings that you would like to add.  Note
   that the global plugin will be loaded after this, it may overrule the
   settings that you do here.  If this is the case, you need to use one of the
   following two methods.

2. Make a copy of the plugin and change it.
   You must put the copy in a directory early in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for
   example, you could do this: >
	cp $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/fortran.vim ~/.vim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  Then you can edit the copied file to your liking.  Since the b:did_ftplugin
   variable will be set, the global plugin will not be loaded.
   A disadvantage of this method is that when the distributed plugin gets
   improved, you will have to copy and modify it again.

3. Overrule the settings after loading the global plugin.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory from the end of
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example, you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  In this file you can change just those settings that you want to change.

CHANGELOG						*ft-changelog-plugin*

Allows for easy entrance of Changelog entries in Changelog files.  There are
some commands, mappings, and variables worth exploring:

Options:
'comments'		is made empty to not mess up formatting.
'textwidth'		is set to 78, which is standard.
'formatoptions'		the 't' flag is added to wrap when inserting text.

Commands:
NewChangelogEntry	Adds a new Changelog entry in an intelligent fashion
			(see below).

Local mappings:
<Leader>o		Starts a new Changelog entry in an equally intelligent
			fashion (see below).

Global mappings:
			NOTE: The global mappings are accessed by sourcing the
			ftplugin/changelog.vim file first, e.g. with >
				runtime ftplugin/changelog.vim
<			in your |.vimrc|.
<Leader>o		Switches to the ChangeLog buffer opened for the
			current directory, or opens it in a new buffer if it
			exists in the current directory.  Then it does the
			same as the local <Leader>o described above.

Variables:
g:changelog_timeformat  Deprecated; use g:changelog_dateformat instead.
g:changelog_dateformat	The date (and time) format used in ChangeLog entries.
			The format accepted is the same as for the
			|strftime()| function.
			The default is "%Y-%m-%d" which is the standard format
			for many ChangeLog layouts.
g:changelog_username	The name and email address of the user.
			The default is deduced from environment variables and
			system files.  It searches /etc/passwd for the comment
			part of the current user, which informally contains
			the real name of the user up to the first separating
			comma.  then it checks the $NAME environment variable
			and finally runs `whoami` and `hostname` to build an
			email address.  The final form is >
				Full Name  <user@host>
<
g:changelog_new_date_format
			The format to use when creating a new date-entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
				%%	insert a single '%' character
				%d	insert the date from above
				%u	insert the user from above
                                %p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "%d  %u\n\n\t* %p%c\n\n", which produces
			something like (| is where cursor will be, unless at
			the start of the line where it denotes the beginning
			of the line) >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
				|
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_new_entry_format
			The format used when creating a new entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
                                %p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "\t*%c", which produces something
			similar to >
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_date_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for a
			date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*%d\_s*%u' which finds lines
			matching the form >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
<			and some similar formats.

g:changelog_date_end_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for the end
			of a date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*$' which finds lines that contain
			only whitespace or are completely empty.

b:changelog_name					*b:changelog_name*
			Name of the ChangeLog file to look for.
			The default is 'ChangeLog'.

b:changelog_path
			Path of the ChangeLog to use for the current buffer.
			The default is empty, thus looking for a file named
			|b:changelog_name| in the same directory as the
			current buffer.  If not found, the parent directory of
			the current buffer is searched.  This continues
			recursively until a file is found or there are no more
			parent directories to search.

b:changelog_entry_prefix
			Name of a function to call to generate a prefix to a
			new entry.  This function takes no arguments and
			should return a string containing the prefix.
			Returning an empty prefix is fine.
			The default generates the shortest path between the
			ChangeLog's pathname and the current buffers pathname.
			In the future, it will also be possible to use other
			variable contexts for this variable, for example, g:.

The Changelog entries are inserted where they add the least amount of text.
After figuring out the current date and user, the file is searched for an
entry beginning with the current date and user and if found adds another item
under it.  If not found, a new entry and item is prepended to the beginning of
the Changelog.


FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-plugin*

Options:
'expandtab'	is switched on to avoid tabs as required by the Fortran
		standards unless the user has set fortran_have_tabs in .vimrc.
'textwidth'	is set to 72 for fixed source format as required by the
		Fortran standards and to 80 for free source format.
'formatoptions' is set to break code and comment lines and to preserve long
		lines.  You can format comments with |gq|.
For further discussion of fortran_have_tabs and the method used for the
detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.


GIT COMMIT                                              *ft-gitcommit-plugin*

One command, :DiffGitCached, is provided to show a diff of the current commit
in the preview window.  It is equivalent to calling "git diff --cached" plus
any arguments given to the command.


MAIL							*ft-mail-plugin*

Options:
'modeline'	is switched off to avoid the danger of trojan horses, and to
		avoid that a Subject line with "Vim:" in it will cause an
		error message.
'textwidth'	is set to 72.  This is often recommended for e-mail.
'formatoptions'  is set to break text lines and to repeat the comment leader
		in new lines, so that a leading ">" for quotes is repeated.
		You can also format quoted text with |gq|.

Local mappings:
<LocalLeader>q   or   \\MailQuote
	Quotes the text selected in Visual mode, or from the cursor position
	to the end of the file in Normal mode.  This means "> " is inserted in
	each line.

MAN							*ft-man-plugin* *:Man*

Displays a manual page in a nice way.  Also see the user manual
|find-manpage|.

To start using the ":Man" command before any manual page was loaded, source
this script from your startup vimrc file: >

	runtime ftplugin/man.vim

Options:
'iskeyword'	the '.' character is added to be able to use CTRL-] on the
		manual page name.

Commands:
Man {name}	Display the manual page for {name} in a window.
Man {number} {name}
		Display the manual page for {name} in a section {number}.

Global mapping:
<Leader>K	Displays the manual page for the word under the cursor.

Local mappings:
CTRL-]		Jump to the manual page for the word under the cursor.
CTRL-T		Jump back to the previous manual page.


PDF							*ft-pdf-plugin*

Two maps, <C-]> and <C-T>, are provided to simulate a tag stack for navigating
the PDF.  The following are treated as tags:

- The byte offset after "startxref" to the xref table
- The byte offset after the /Prev key in the trailer to an earlier xref table
- A line of the form "0123456789 00000 n" in the xref table
- An object reference like "1 0 R" anywhere in the PDF

These maps can be disabled with >
	:let g:no_pdf_maps = 1
<

RPM SPEC						*ft-spec-plugin*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |pi_spec.txt|.


SQL							*ft-sql*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |ft_sql.txt|.


TEX						*ft-tex-plugin* *g:tex_flavor*

If the first line of a *.tex file has the form >
	%&<format>
then this determined the file type:  plaintex (for plain TeX), context (for
ConTeXt), or tex (for LaTeX).  Otherwise, the file is searched for keywords to
choose context or tex.  If no keywords are found, it defaults to plaintex.
You can change the default by defining the variable g:tex_flavor to the format
(not the file type) you use most.  Use one of these: >
	let g:tex_flavor = "plain"
	let g:tex_flavor = "context"
	let g:tex_flavor = "latex"
Currently no other formats are recognized.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Folding						*Folding* *folding* *folds*

You can find an introduction on folding in chapter 28 of the user manual.
|usr_28.txt|

1. Fold methods		|fold-methods|
2. Fold commands	|fold-commands|
3. Fold options		|fold-options|
4. Behavior of folds	|fold-behavior|

{Vi has no Folding}
{not available when compiled without the |+folding| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Fold methods					*fold-methods*

The folding method can be set with the 'foldmethod' option.

When setting 'foldmethod' to a value other than "manual", all folds are
deleted and new ones created.  Switching to the "manual" method doesn't remove
the existing folds.  This can be used to first define the folds automatically
and then change them manually.

There are six methods to select folds:
	manual		manually define folds
	indent		more indent means a higher fold level
	expr		specify an expression to define folds
	syntax		folds defined by syntax highlighting
	diff		folds for unchanged text
	marker		folds defined by markers in the text


MANUAL						*fold-manual*

Use commands to manually define the fold regions.  This can also be used by a
script that parses text to find folds.

The level of a fold is only defined by its nesting.  To increase the fold
level of a fold for a range of lines, define a fold inside it that has the
same lines.

The manual folds are lost when you abandon the file.  To save the folds use
the |:mkview| command.  The view can be restored later with |:loadview|.


INDENT						*fold-indent*

The folds are automatically defined by the indent of the lines.

The foldlevel is computed from the indent of the line, divided by the
'shiftwidth' (rounded down).  A sequence of lines with the same or higher fold
level form a fold, with the lines with a higher level forming a nested fold.

The nesting of folds is limited with 'foldnestmax'.

Some lines are ignored and get the fold level of the line above or below it,
whichever is lower.  These are empty or white lines and lines starting
with a character in 'foldignore'.  White space is skipped before checking for
characters in 'foldignore'.  For C use "#" to ignore preprocessor lines.

When you want to ignore lines in another way, use the 'expr' method.  The
|indent()| function can be used in 'foldexpr' to get the indent of a line.


EXPR						*fold-expr*

The folds are automatically defined by their foldlevel, like with the "indent"
method.  The value of the 'foldexpr' option is evaluated to get the foldlevel
of a line.  Examples:
This will create a fold for all consecutive lines that start with a tab: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)[0]==\"\\t\"
This will call a function to compute the fold level: >
	:set foldexpr=MyFoldLevel(v:lnum)
This will make a fold out of paragraphs separated by blank lines: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^\\s*$'&&getline(v:lnum+1)=~'\\S'?'<1':1
this does the same: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum-1)=~'^\\s*$'&&getline(v:lnum)=~'\\S'?'>1':1

Note that backslashes must be used to escape characters that ":set" handles
differently (space, backslash, double quote, etc., see |option-backslash|).

These are the conditions with which the expression is evaluated:
- The current buffer and window are set for the line.
- The variable "v:lnum" is set to the line number.
- The result is used for the fold level in this way:
  value			meaning ~
  0			the line is not in a fold
  1, 2, ..		the line is in a fold with this level
  -1			the fold level is undefined, use the fold level of a
			line before or after this line, whichever is the
			lowest.
  "="			use fold level from the previous line
  "a1", "a2", ..	add one, two, .. to the fold level of the previous
			line
  "s1", "s2", ..	subtract one, two, .. from the fold level of the
			previous line
  "<1", "<2", ..	a fold with this level ends at this line
  ">1", ">2", ..	a fold with this level starts at this line

It is not required to mark the start (end) of a fold with ">1" ("<1"), a fold
will also start (end) when the fold level is higher (lower) than the fold
level of the previous line.

There must be no side effects from the expression.  The text in the buffer,
cursor position, the search patterns, options etc. must not be changed.
You can change and restore them if you are careful.

If there is some error in the expression, or the resulting value isn't
recognized, there is no error message and the fold level will be zero.
For debugging the 'debug' option can be set to "msg", the error messages will
be visible then.

Note: Since the expression has to be evaluated for every line, this fold
method can be very slow!

Try to avoid the "=", "a" and "s" return values, since Vim often has to search
backwards for a line for which the fold level is defined.  This can be slow.

|foldlevel()| can be useful to compute a fold level relative to a previous
fold level.  But note that foldlevel() may return -1 if the level is not known
yet.  And it returns the level at the start of the line, while a fold might
end in that line.

It may happened that folds are not updated properly.  You can use |zx| or |zX|
to force updating folds.


SYNTAX						*fold-syntax*

A fold is defined by syntax items that have the "fold" argument. |:syn-fold|

The fold level is defined by nesting folds.  The nesting of folds is limited
with 'foldnestmax'.

Be careful to specify proper syntax syncing.  If this is not done right, folds
may differ from the displayed highlighting.  This is especially relevant when
using patterns that match more than one line.  In case of doubt, try using
brute-force syncing: >
	:syn sync fromstart


DIFF						*fold-diff*

The folds are automatically defined for text that is not part of a change or
close to a change.

This method only works properly when the 'diff' option is set for the current
window and changes are being displayed.  Otherwise the whole buffer will be
one big fold.

The 'diffopt' option can be used to specify the context.  That is, the number
of lines between the fold and a change that are not included in the fold.  For
example, to use a context of 8 lines: >
	:set diffopt=filler,context:8
The default context is six lines.

When 'scrollbind' is also set, Vim will attempt to keep the same folds open in
other diff windows, so that the same text is visible.


MARKER						*fold-marker*

Markers in the text tell where folds start and end.  This allows you to
precisely specify the folds.  This will allow deleting and putting a fold,
without the risk of including the wrong lines.  The 'foldtext' option is
normally set such that the text before the marker shows up in the folded line.
This makes it possible to give a name to the fold.

Markers can have a level included, or can use matching pairs.  Including a
level is easier, you don't have to add end markers and avoid problems with
non-matching marker pairs.  Example: >
	/* global variables {{{1 */
	int varA, varB;

	/* functions {{{1 */
	/* funcA() {{{2 */
	void funcA() {}

	/* funcB() {{{2 */
	void funcB() {}

A fold starts at a "{{{" marker.  The following number specifies the fold
level.  What happens depends on the difference between the current fold level
and the level given by the marker:
1. If a marker with the same fold level is encountered, the previous fold
   ends and another fold with the same level starts.
2. If a marker with a higher fold level is found, a nested fold is started.
3. if a marker with a lower fold level is found, all folds up to and including
   this level end and a fold with the specified level starts.

The number indicates the fold level.  A zero cannot be used (a marker with
level zero is ignored).  You can use "}}}" with a digit to indicate the level
of the fold that ends.  The fold level of the following line will be one less
than the indicated level.  Note that Vim doesn't look back to the level of the
matching marker (that would take too much time).  Example: >

	{{{1
	fold level here is 1
	{{{3
	fold level here is 3
	}}}3
	fold level here is 2

You can also use matching pairs of "{{{" and "}}}" markers to define folds.
Each "{{{" increases the fold level by one, each "}}}" decreases the fold
level by one.  Be careful to keep the markers matching!  Example: >

	{{{
	fold level here is 1
	{{{
	fold level here is 2
	}}}
	fold level here is 1

You can mix using markers with a number and without a number.  A useful way of
doing this is to use numbered markers for large folds, and unnumbered markers
locally in a function.  For example use level one folds for the sections of
your file like "structure definitions", "local variables" and "functions".
Use level 2 markers for each definition and function,  Use unnumbered markers
inside functions.  When you make changes in a function to split up folds, you
don't have to renumber the markers.

The markers can be set with the 'foldmarker' option.  It is recommended to
keep this at the default value of "{{{,}}}", so that files can be exchanged
between Vim users.  Only change it when it is required for the file (e.g., it
contains markers from another folding editor, or the default markers cause
trouble for the language of the file).

							*fold-create-marker*
"zf" can be used to create a fold defined by markers.  Vim will insert the
markers for you.  Vim will append the start and end marker, as specified with
'foldmarker'.  The markers are appended to the end of the line.
'commentstring' is used if it isn't empty.
This does not work properly when:
- The line already contains a marker with a level number.  Vim then doesn't
  know what to do.
- Folds nearby use a level number in their marker which gets in the way.
- The line is inside a comment, 'commentstring' isn't empty and nested
  comments don't work.  For example with C: adding /* {{{ */ inside a comment
  will truncate the existing comment.  Either put the marker before or after
  the comment, or add the marker manually.
Generally it's not a good idea to let Vim create markers when you already have
markers with a level number.

							*fold-delete-marker*
"zd" can be used to delete a fold defined by markers.  Vim will delete the
markers for you.  Vim will search for the start and end markers, as specified
with 'foldmarker', at the start and end of the fold.  When the text around the
marker matches with 'commentstring', that text is deleted as well.
This does not work properly when:
- A line contains more than one marker and one of them specifies a level.
  Only the first one is removed, without checking if this will have the
  desired effect of deleting the fold.
- The marker contains a level number and is used to start or end several folds
  at the same time.

==============================================================================
2. Fold commands				*fold-commands* *E490*

All folding commands start with "z".  Hint: the "z" looks like a folded piece
of paper, if you look at it from the side.


CREATING AND DELETING FOLDS ~
							*zf* *E350*
zf{motion}  or
{Visual}zf	Operator to create a fold.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		The new fold will be closed for the "manual" method.
		'foldenable' will be set.
		Also see |fold-create-marker|.

							*zF*
zF		Create a fold for [count] lines.  Works like "zf".

:{range}fo[ld]						*:fold* *:fo*
		Create a fold for the lines in {range}.  Works like "zf".

							*zd* *E351*
zd		Delete one fold at the cursor.  When the cursor is on a folded
		line, that fold is deleted.  Nested folds are moved one level
		up.  In Visual mode one level of all folds (partially) in the
		selected area are deleted.
		Careful: This easily deletes more folds than you expect and
		there is no undo for manual folding.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.

							*zD*
zD		Delete folds recursively at the cursor.  In Visual mode all
		folds (partially) in the selected area and all nested folds in
		them are deleted.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.

							*zE* *E352*
zE		Eliminate all folds in the window.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.


OPENING AND CLOSING FOLDS ~

A fold smaller than 'foldminlines' will always be displayed like it was open.
Therefore the commands below may work differently on small folds.

							*zo*
zo		Open one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep will be opened.  In Visual mode one level of
		folds is opened for all lines in the selected area.

							*zO*
zO		Open all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that don't
		contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it opens all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.

							*zc*
zc		Close one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep are closed.  In Visual mode one level of folds
		is closed for all lines in the selected area.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zC*
zC		Close all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that
		don't contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it closes all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*za*
za		When on a closed fold: open it.  When folds are nested, you
		may have to use "za" several times.  When a count is given,
		that many closed folds are opened.
		When on an open fold: close it and set 'foldenable'.  This
		will only close one level, since using "za" again will open
		the fold.  When a count is given that many folds will be
		closed (that's not the same as repeating "za" that many
		times).

							*zA*
zA		When on a closed fold: open it recursively.
		When on an open fold: close it recursively and set
		'foldenable'.

							*zv*
zv		View cursor line: Open just enough folds to make the line in
		which the cursor is located not folded.

							*zx*
zx		Update folds: Undo manually opened and closed folds: re-apply
		'foldlevel', then do "zv": View cursor line.
		Also forces recomputing folds.  This is useful when using
		'foldexpr' and the buffer is changed in a way that results in
		folds not to be updated properly.

							*zX*
zX		Undo manually opened and closed folds: re-apply 'foldlevel'.
		Also forces recomputing folds, like |zx|.

							*zm*
zm		Fold more: Subtract one from 'foldlevel'.  If 'foldlevel' was
		already zero nothing happens.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zM*
zM		Close all folds: set 'foldlevel' to 0.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zr*
zr		Reduce folding: Add one to 'foldlevel'.

							*zR*
zR		Open all folds.  This sets 'foldlevel' to highest fold level.

							*:foldo* *:foldopen*
:{range}foldo[pen][!]
		Open folds in {range}.  When [!] is added all folds are
		opened.  Useful to see all the text in {range}.  Without [!]
		one level of folds is opened.

							*:foldc* *:foldclose*
:{range}foldc[lose][!]
		Close folds in {range}.  When [!] is added all folds are
		closed.  Useful to hide all the text in {range}.  Without [!]
		one level of folds is closed.

							*zn*
zn		Fold none: reset 'foldenable'.  All folds will be open.

							*zN*
zN		Fold normal: set 'foldenable'.  All folds will be as they
		were before.

							*zi*
zi		Invert 'foldenable'.


MOVING OVER FOLDS ~
							*[z*
[z		Move to the start of the current open fold.  If already at the
		start, move to the start of the fold that contains it.  If
		there is no containing fold, the command fails.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.

							*]z*
]z		Move to the end of the current open fold.  If already at the
		end, move to the end of the fold that contains it.  If there
		is no containing fold, the command fails.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.

							*zj*
zj		Move downwards to the start of the next fold.  A closed fold
		is counted as one fold.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.
		This command can be used after an |operator|.

							*zk*
zk		Move upwards to the end of the previous fold.  A closed fold
		is counted as one fold.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.
		This command can be used after an |operator|.


EXECUTING COMMANDS ON FOLDS ~

:[range]foldd[oopen] {cmd}			*:foldd* *:folddoopen*
		Execute {cmd} on all lines that are not in a closed fold.
		When [range] is given, only these lines are used.
		Each time {cmd} is executed the cursor is positioned on the
		line it is executed for.
		This works like the ":global" command: First all lines that
		are not in a closed fold are marked.  Then the {cmd} is
		executed for all marked lines.  Thus when {cmd} changes the
		folds, this has no influence on where it is executed (except
		when lines are deleted, of course).
		Example: >
			:folddoopen s/end/loop_end/ge
<		Note the use of the "e" flag to avoid getting an error message
		where "end" doesn't match.

:[range]folddoc[losed] {cmd}			*:folddoc* *:folddoclosed*
		Execute {cmd} on all lines that are in a closed fold.
		Otherwise like ":folddoopen".

==============================================================================
3. Fold options					*fold-options*

COLORS							*fold-colors*

The colors of a closed fold are set with the Folded group |hl-Folded|.  The
colors of the fold column are set with the FoldColumn group |hl-FoldColumn|.
Example to set the colors: >

	:highlight Folded guibg=grey guifg=blue
	:highlight FoldColumn guibg=darkgrey guifg=white


FOLDLEVEL						*fold-foldlevel*

'foldlevel' is a number option: The higher the more folded regions are open.
When 'foldlevel' is 0, all folds are closed.
When 'foldlevel' is positive, some folds are closed.
When 'foldlevel' is very high, all folds are open.
'foldlevel' is applied when it is changed.  After that manually folds can be
opened and closed.
When increased, folds above the new level are opened.  No manually opened
folds will be closed.
When decreased, folds above the new level are closed.  No manually closed
folds will be opened.


FOLDTEXT						*fold-foldtext*

'foldtext' is a string option that specifies an expression.  This expression
is evaluated to obtain the text displayed for a closed fold.  Example: >

    :set foldtext=v:folddashes.substitute(getline(v:foldstart),'/\\*\\\|\\*/\\\|{{{\\d\\=','','g')

This shows the first line of the fold, with "/*", "*/" and "{{{" removed.
Note the use of backslashes to avoid some characters to be interpreted by the
":set" command.  It's simpler to define a function and call that: >

    :set foldtext=MyFoldText()
    :function MyFoldText()
    :  let line = getline(v:foldstart)
    :  let sub = substitute(line, '/\*\|\*/\|{{{\d\=', '', 'g')
    :  return v:folddashes . sub
    :endfunction

Evaluating 'foldtext' is done in the |sandbox|.  The current window is set to
the window that displays the line.  Errors are ignored.

The default value is |foldtext()|.  This returns a reasonable text for most
types of folding.  If you don't like it, you can specify your own 'foldtext'
expression.  It can use these special Vim variables:
	v:foldstart	line number of first line in the fold
	v:foldend	line number of last line in the fold
	v:folddashes	a string that contains dashes to represent the
			foldlevel.
	v:foldlevel	the foldlevel of the fold

In the result a TAB is replaced with a space and unprintable characters are
made into printable characters.

The resulting line is truncated to fit in the window, it never wraps.
When there is room after the text, it is filled with the character specified
by 'fillchars'.

Note that backslashes need to be used for characters that the ":set" command
handles differently: Space, backslash and double-quote. |option-backslash|


FOLDCOLUMN						*fold-foldcolumn*

'foldcolumn' is a number, which sets the width for a column on the side of the
window to indicate folds.  When it is zero, there is no foldcolumn.  A normal
value is 4 or 5.  The minimal useful value is 2, although 1 still provides
some information.  The maximum is 12.

An open fold is indicated with a column that has a '-' at the top and '|'
characters below it.  This column stops where the open fold stops.  When folds
nest, the nested fold is one character right of the fold it's contained in.

A closed fold is indicated with a '+'.

Where the fold column is too narrow to display all nested folds, digits are
shown to indicate the nesting level.

The mouse can also be used to open and close folds by clicking in the
fold column:
- Click on a '+' to open the closed fold at this row.
- Click on any other non-blank character to close the open fold at this row.


OTHER OPTIONS

'foldenable'  'fen':	Open all folds while not set.
'foldexpr'    'fde':	Expression used for "expr" folding.
'foldignore'  'fdi':	Characters used for "indent" folding.
'foldmarker'  'fmr':	Defined markers used for "marker" folding.
'foldmethod'  'fdm':	Name of the current folding method.
'foldminlines' 'fml':	Minimum number of screen lines for a fold to be
			displayed closed.
'foldnestmax' 'fdn':	Maximum nesting for "indent" and "syntax" folding.
'foldopen'    'fdo':	Which kinds of commands open closed folds.
'foldclose'   'fcl':	When the folds not under the cursor are closed.

==============================================================================
4. Behavior of folds					*fold-behavior*

When moving the cursor upwards or downwards and when scrolling, the cursor
will move to the first line of a sequence of folded lines.  When the cursor is
already on a folded line, it moves to the next unfolded line or the next
closed fold.

While the cursor is on folded lines, the cursor is always displayed in the
first column.  The ruler does show the actual cursor position, but since the
line is folded, it cannot be displayed there.

Many movement commands handle a sequence of folded lines like an empty line.
For example, the "w" command stops once in the first column.

When in Insert mode, the cursor line is never folded.  That allows you to see
what you type!

When using an operator, a closed fold is included as a whole.  Thus "dl"
deletes the whole closed fold under the cursor.

For Ex commands the range is adjusted to always start at the first line of a
closed fold and end at the last line of a closed fold.  Thus this command: >
	:s/foo/bar/g
when used with the cursor on a closed fold, will replace "foo" with "bar" in
all lines of the fold.
This does not happen for |:folddoopen| and |:folddoclosed|.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used folding
settings are used again.  For manual folding the defined folds are restored.
For all folding methods the manually opened and closed folds are restored.
If this buffer has been edited in this window, the values from back then are
used.  Otherwise the values from the window where the buffer was edited last
are used.

6.  Extra Plug-ins			    |ada-extra-plugins|

==============================================================================
1. Syntax Highlighting ~
							       *ft-ada-syntax*

This mode is designed for the 2005 edition of Ada ("Ada 2005"), which includes
support for objected-programming, protected types, and so on.  It handles code
written for the original Ada language ("Ada83", "Ada87", "Ada95") as well,
though code which uses Ada 2005-only keywords will be wrongly colored (such
code should be fixed anyway).  For more information about Ada, see
http://www.adapower.com.

The Ada mode handles a number of situations cleanly.

For example, it knows that the "-" in "-5" is a number, but the same character
in "A-5" is an operator.  Normally, a "with" or "use" clause referencing
another compilation unit is coloured the same way as C's "#include" is coloured.
If you have "Conditional" or "Repeat" groups coloured differently, then "end
if" and "end loop" will be coloured as part of those respective groups.

You can set these to different colours using vim's "highlight" command (e.g.,
to change how loops are displayed, enter the command ":hi Repeat" followed by
the colour specification; on simple terminals the colour specification
ctermfg=White often shows well).

There are several options you can select in this Ada mode. See |ft-ada-options|
for a complete list.

To enable them, assign a value to the option.  For example, to turn one on:
 >
    > let g:ada_standard_types = 1
>
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example:
>
    > unlet g:ada_standard_types

You can just use ":" and type these into the command line to set these
temporarily before loading an Ada file.  You can make these option settings
permanent by adding the "let" command(s), without a colon, to your "~/.vimrc"
file.

Even on a slow (90Mhz) PC this mode works quickly, but if you find the
performance unacceptable, turn on |g:ada_withuse_ordinary|.

Syntax folding instructions (|fold-syntax|) are added when |g:ada_folding| is
set.

==============================================================================
2. File type Plug-in ~
					       *ft-ada-indent* *ft-ada-plugin*

The Ada plug-in provides support for:

 - auto indenting	(|indent.txt|)
 - insert completion	(|i_CTRL-N|)
 - user completion	(|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|)
 - tag searches		(|tagsrch.txt|)
 - Quick Fix		(|quickfix.txt|)
 - backspace handling	(|'backspace'|)
 - comment handling	(|'comments'|, |'commentstring'|)

The plug-in only activates the features of the Ada mode whenever an Ada
file is opened and adds Ada related entries to the main and pop-up menu.

==============================================================================
3. Omni Completion ~
								 *ft-ada-omni*

The Ada omni-completions (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) uses tags database created either
by "gnat xref -v" or the "exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net).  The
complete function will automatically detect which tool was used to create the
tags file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Omni Completion with "gnat xref" ~
								   *gnat-xref*

GNAT XREF uses the compiler internal information (ali-files) to produce the
tags file. This has the advantage to be 100% correct and the option of deep
nested analysis. However the code must compile, the generator is quite
slow and the created tags file contains only the basic Ctags information for
each entry - not enough for some of the more advanced Vim code browser
plug-ins.

NOTE: "gnat xref -v" is very tricky to use as it has almost no diagnostic
       output - If nothing is printed then usually the parameters are wrong.
       Here some important tips:

1)  You need to compile your code first and use the "-aO" option to point to
    your .ali files.
2)  "gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads" won't work - use  the "gnat xref -v
    -aI../Include adacl.ads" instead.
3)  "gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?" won't work - use "cd ../Include" and
    then "gnat xref -v *.ad?"
4)  Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try "gnat xref
    -Padacl.gpr".
5)  VIM is faster when the tags file is sorted - use "sort --unique
    --ignore-case --output=tags tags" .
6)  Remember to insert "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED 2 %sort ui" as first line to mark
    the file assorted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Omni Completion with "ctags"~
								   *ada-ctags*

Exuberant Ctags uses its own multi-language code parser. The parser is quite
fast, produces a lot of extra information (hence the name "Exuberant Ctags")
and can run on files which currently do not compile.

There are also lots of other Vim-tools which use exuberant Ctags.

You will need to install a version of the Exuberant Ctags which has Ada
support patched in. Such a version is available from the GNU Ada Project
(http://gnuada.sourceforge.net).

The Ada parser for Exuberant Ctags is fairly new - don't expect complete
support yet.

==============================================================================
4. Compiler Support ~
								*ada-compiler*

The Ada mode supports more than one Ada compiler and will automatically load the
compiler set in |g:ada_default_compiler| whenever an Ada source is opened. The
provided compiler plug-ins are split into the actual compiler plug-in and a
collection of support functions and variables. This allows the easy
development of specialized compiler plug-ins fine tuned to your development
environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 GNAT ~
							       *compiler-gnat*

GNAT is the only free (beer and speech) Ada compiler available. There are
several versions available which differ in the licence terms used.

The GNAT compiler plug-in will perform a compile on pressing <F7> and then
immediately shows the result. You can set the project file to be used by
setting:
 >
 > call g:gnat.Set_Project_File ('my_project.gpr')

Setting a project file will also create a Vim session (|views-sessions|) so -
like with the GPS - opened files, window positions etc. will be remembered
separately for all projects.

								*gnat_members*
GNAT OBJECT ~

							       *g:gnat.Make()*
g:gnat.Make()
		Calls |g:gnat.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
               |quickfix| window.

							     *g:gnat.Pretty()*
g:gnat.Pretty()
		Calls |g:gnat.Pretty_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Find()*
g:gnat.Find()
		Calls |g:gnat.Find_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Tags()*
g:gnat.Tags()
		Calls |g:gnat.Tags_Command|

						   *g:gnat.Set_Project_File()*
g:gnat.Set_Project_File([{file}])
		Set gnat project file and load associated session.  An open
		project will be closed and the session written.  If called
		without file name the file selector opens for selection of a
		project file. If called with an empty string then the project
		and associated session are closed.

							 *g:gnat.Project_File*
g:gnat.Project_File	string
		Current project file.

							 *g:gnat.Make_Command*
g:gnat.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:gnat.Pretty_Program*
g:gnat.Pretty_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Pretty()|

							 *g:gnat.Find_Program*
g:gnat.Find_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Find()|

							 *g:gnat.Tags_Command*
g:gnat.Tags_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Tags()|

							 *g:gnat.Error_Format*
g:gnat.Error_Format	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Dec Ada ~
					    *compiler-hpada* *compiler-decada*
					*compiler-vaxada* *compiler-compaqada*

Dec Ada (also known by - in chronological order - VAX Ada, Dec Ada, Compaq Ada
and HP Ada) is a fairly dated Ada 83 compiler. Support is basic: <F7> will
compile the current unit.

The Dec Ada compiler expects the package name and not the file name to be
passed as a parameter. The compiler plug-in supports the usual file name
convention to convert the file into a unit name. Both '-' and '__' are allowed
as separators.

							      *decada_members*
DEC ADA OBJECT ~

							     *g:decada.Make()*
g:decada.Make()		function
		Calls |g:decada.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
		|quickfix| window.

							*g:decada.Unit_Name()*
g:decada.Unit_Name()	function
		Get the Unit name for the current file.

						       *g:decada.Make_Command*
g:decada.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:decada.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:decada.Error_Format*
g:decada.Error_Format|	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|).

		Highlight lines which are too long. Note: This highlighting
		option is quite CPU intensive.

							 *g:ada_rainbow_color*
g:ada_rainbow_color	  bool (true when exists)
		Use rainbow colours for '(' and ')'. You need the
		rainbow_parenthesis for this to work.

							       *g:ada_folding*
g:ada_folding		  set ('sigpft')
		Use folding for Ada sources.
		    's':    activate syntax folding on load
			'p':    fold packages
			'f':    fold functions and procedures
			't':    fold types
			'c':    fold conditionals
		    'g':    activate gnat pretty print folding on load
			'i':    lone 'is' folded with line above
			'b':	lone 'begin' folded with line above
			'p':	lone 'private' folded with line above
			'x':	lone 'exception' folded with line above
		    'i':    activate indent folding on load

		Note: Syntax folding is in an early (unusable) stage and
		      indent or gnat pretty folding is suggested.

		For gnat pretty folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: -cl3 -M79 -c2 -c3 -c4 -A1 -A2 -A3 -A4 -A5

		For indent folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: shiftwidth=3 softtabstop=3

								*g:ada_abbrev*
g:ada_abbrev		  bool (true when exists)
		Add some abbreviations. This feature is more or less superseded
		by the various completion methods.

						      *g:ada_withuse_ordinary*
g:ada_withuse_ordinary	  bool (true when exists)
		Show "with" and "use" as ordinary keywords (when used to
		reference other compilation units they're normally highlighted
		specially).

							 *g:ada_begin_preproc*
g:ada_begin_preproc	  bool (true when exists)
		Show all begin-like keywords using the colouring of C
		preprocessor commands.

						    *g:ada_omni_with_keywords*
g:ada_omni_with_keywords
		Add Keywords, Pragmas, Attributes to omni-completions
		(|compl-omni|). Note: You can always complete then with user
		completion (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|).

g:ada_extended_tagging	  enum ('jump', 'list')
		use extended tagging, two options are available
		    'jump': use tjump to jump.
		    'list': add tags quick fix list.
		Normal tagging does not support function or operator
		overloading as these features are not available in C and
		tagging was originally developed for C.

						   *g:ada_extended_completion*
g:ada_extended_completion
		Uses extended completion for <C-N> and <C-R> completions
		(|i_CTRL-N|). In this mode the '.' is used as part of the

==============================================================================
6. Extra Plugins ~
							   *ada-extra-plugins*

You can optionally install the following extra plug-ins. They work well with
Ada and enhance the ability of the Ada mode:

backup.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1537
	Keeps as many backups as you like so you don't have to.

rainbow_parenthsis.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561
	Very helpful since Ada uses only '(' and ')'.

nerd_comments.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218
	Excellent commenting and uncommenting support for almost any
	programming language.

matchit.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39
	'%' jumping for any language. The normal '%' jump only works for '{}'
	style languages. The Ada mode will set the needed search patterns.

taglist.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273
	Source code explorer sidebar. There is a patch for Ada available.

The GNU Ada Project distribution (http://gnuada.sourceforge.net) of Vim
contains all of the above.

Last change: 2013 May 15

by David Fishburn

This is a filetype plugin to work with SQL files.

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard which specifies statements
that allow a user to interact with a relational database.  Vim includes
features for navigation, indentation and syntax highlighting.

    4.4 Completion Customization		|sql-completion-customization|
    4.5 SQL Maps				|sql-completion-maps|
    4.6 Using with other filetypes		|sql-completion-filetypes|

==============================================================================
1. Navigation					*sql-navigation*

The SQL ftplugin provides a number of options to assist with file
navigation.


1.1 Matchit					*sql-matchit*
-----------
The matchit plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39)
provides many additional features and can be customized for different
languages.  The matchit plugin is configured by defining a local
buffer variable, b:match_words.  Pressing the % key while on various
keywords will move the cursor to its match.  For example, if the cursor
is on an "if", pressing % will cycle between the "else", "elseif" and
"end if" keywords.

The following keywords are supported: >
    if
    elseif | elsif
    else [if]
    end if

    [while condition] loop
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    for
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    do
	statements
    doend

    case
    when
    when
    default
    end case

    merge
    when not matched
    when matched

    create[ or replace] procedure|function|event
    returns


1.2 Text Object Motions				*sql-object-motions*
-----------------------
Vim has a number of predefined keys for working with text |object-motions|.
This filetype plugin attempts to translate these keys to maps which make sense
for the SQL language.

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps exist (when you edit a SQL
file): >
    ]]		    move forward to the next 'begin'
    [[		    move backwards to the previous 'begin'
    ][		    move forward to the next 'end'
    []		    move backwards to the previous 'end'


1.3 Predefined Object Motions			*sql-predefined-objects*
-----------------------------
Most relational databases support various standard features, tables, indices,
triggers and stored procedures.  Each vendor also has a variety of proprietary
objects.  The next set of maps have been created to help move between these
objects.  Depends on which database vendor you are using, the list of objects
must be configurable.  The filetype plugin attempts to define many of the
standard objects, plus many additional ones.  In order to make this as
flexible as possible, you can override the list of objects from within your
|vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created which use
the above list: >
    ]}		    move forward to the next 'create <object name>'
    [{		    move backward to the previous 'create <object name>'

Repeatedly pressing ]} will cycle through each of these create statements: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );

    create procedure p1
    begin
	...
    end;

    create index i1 on t1 (c1);

The default setting for g:ftplugin_sql_objects is: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,' .
		\ '\\(existing\\\\|global\\s\\+temporary\\s\\+\\)\\\{,1}' .
		\ 'table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The above will also handle these cases: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );
    create existing table t2 (
	...
    );
    create global temporary table t3 (
	...
    );

By default, the ftplugin only searches for CREATE statements.  You can also
override this via your |vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_statements = 'create,alter'

The filetype plugin defines three types of comments: >
    1.  --
    2.  //
    3.  /*
	 *
	 */

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created to work
with comments: >
    ]"		    move forward to the beginning of a comment
    ["		    move forward to the end of a comment



1.4 Macros					   *sql-macros*
----------
Vim's feature to find macro definitions, |'define'|, is supported using this
regular expression: >
    \c\<\(VARIABLE\|DECLARE\|IN\|OUT\|INOUT\)\>

This addresses the following code: >
    CREATE VARIABLE myVar1 INTEGER;

    CREATE PROCEDURE sp_test(
	IN myVar2 INTEGER,
	OUT myVar3 CHAR(30),
	INOUT myVar4 NUMERIC(20,0)
    )
    BEGIN
	DECLARE myVar5 INTEGER;

	SELECT c1, c2, c3
	  INTO myVar2, myVar3, myVar4
	  FROM T1
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
    END;

Place your cursor on "myVar1" on this line: >
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
		     ^

Press any of the following keys: >
    [d
    [D
    [CTRL-D


==============================================================================
2. SQL Dialects					*sql-dialects* *sql-types*
						*sybase* *TSQL* *Transact-SQL*
						*sqlanywhere*
						*oracle* *plsql* *sqlj*
						*sqlserver*
						*mysql* *postgresql* *psql*
						*informix*

All relational databases support SQL.  There is a portion of SQL that is
portable across vendors (ex. CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX), but there is a
great deal of vendor specific extensions to SQL.  Oracle supports the
"CREATE OR REPLACE" syntax, column defaults specified in the CREATE TABLE
statement and the procedural language (for stored procedures and triggers).

The default Vim distribution ships with syntax highlighting based on Oracle's
PL/SQL.  The default SQL indent script works for Oracle and SQL Anywhere.
The default filetype plugin works for all vendors and should remain vendor
neutral, but extendable.

Vim currently has support for a variety of different vendors, currently this
is via syntax scripts. Unfortunately, to flip between different syntax rules
you must either create:
    1.  New filetypes
    2.  Custom autocmds
    3.  Manual steps / commands

The majority of people work with only one vendor's database product, it would
be nice to specify a default in your |vimrc|.


2.1 SQLSetType					*sqlsettype* *SQLSetType*
--------------
For the people that work with many different databases, it is nice to be
able to flip between the various vendors rules (indent, syntax) on a per
buffer basis, at any time.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLSetType

Executing this function without any parameters will set the indent and syntax
scripts back to their defaults, see |sql-type-default|.  If you have turned
off Vi's compatibility mode, |'compatible'|, you can use the <Tab> key to
complete the optional parameter.

After typing the function name and a space, you can use the completion to
supply a parameter.  The function takes the name of the Vim script you want to
source.  Using the |cmdline-completion| feature, the SQLSetType function will
search the |'runtimepath'| for all Vim scripts with a name containing 'sql'.
This takes the guess work out of the spelling of the names.  The following are
examples: >
    :SQLSetType
    :SQLSetType sqloracle
    :SQLSetType sqlanywhere
    :SQLSetType sqlinformix
    :SQLSetType mysql

The easiest approach is to the use <Tab> character which will first complete
the command name (SQLSetType), after a space and another <Tab>, display a list
of available Vim script names: >
    :SQL<Tab><space><Tab>


2.2 SQLGetType					*sqlgettype* *SQLGetType*
--------------
At anytime you can determine which SQL dialect you are using by calling the
SQLGetType command.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLGetType

This will echo: >
    Current SQL dialect in use:sqlanywhere


2.3 SQL Dialect Default				*sql-type-default*
-----------------------
As mentioned earlier, the default syntax rules for Vim is based on Oracle
(PL/SQL).  You can override this default by placing one of the following in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlanywhere'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'mysql'

If you added the following to your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'

The next time edit a SQL file the following scripts will be automatically
loaded by Vim: >
    ftplugin/sql.vim
    syntax/sqlinformix.vim
    indent/sql.vim
>
Notice indent/sqlinformix.sql was not loaded.  There is no indent file
for Informix, Vim loads the default files if the specified files does not
exist.


==============================================================================
3. Adding new SQL Dialects			*sql-adding-dialects*

If you begin working with a SQL dialect which does not have any customizations
available with the default Vim distribution you can check http://www.vim.org
to see if any customization currently exist.  If not, you can begin by cloning
an existing script.  Read |filetype-plugins| for more details.

To help identify these scripts, try to create the files with a "sql" prefix.
If you decide you wish to create customizations for the SQLite database, you
can create any of the following: >
    Unix
	~/.vim/syntax/sqlite.vim
	~/.vim/indent/sqlite.vim
    Windows
	$VIM/vimfiles/syntax/sqlite.vim
	$VIM/vimfiles/indent/sqlite.vim

No changes are necessary to the SQLSetType function.  It will automatically
pickup the new SQL files and load them when you issue the SQLSetType command.


==============================================================================
4. OMNI SQL Completion				*sql-completion*
						*omni-sql-completion*

Vim 7 includes a code completion interface and functions which allows plugin
developers to build in code completion for any language.  Vim 7 includes
code completion for the SQL language.

There are two modes to the SQL completion plugin, static and dynamic.  The
static mode populates the popups with the data generated from current syntax
highlight rules.  The dynamic mode populates the popups with data retrieved
directly from a database.  This includes, table lists, column lists,
procedures names and more.

4.1 Static Mode					*sql-completion-static*
---------------
The static popups created contain items defined by the active syntax rules
while editing a file with a filetype of SQL.  The plugin defines (by default)
various maps to help the user refine the list of items to be displayed.
The defaults static maps are: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>a <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('syntax')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>f <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlFunction')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>o <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlOption')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>T <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlType')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>s <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlStatement')<CR><C-X><C-O>

The use of "<C-C>" can be user chosen by using the following in your |.vimrc| as it 
may not work properly on all platforms: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key = '<C-C>'
>
The static maps (which are based on the syntax highlight groups) follow this
format: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword\w*')<CR><C-X><C-O>

This command breaks down as: >
    imap		   - Create an insert map
    <buffer>		   - Only for this buffer
    <C-C>k		   - Your choice of key map
    <C-\><C-O>		   - Execute one command, return to Insert mode
    :call sqlcomplete#Map( - Allows the SQL completion plugin to perform some
			     housekeeping functions to allow it to be used in
			     conjunction with other completion plugins.
			     Indicate which item you want the SQL completion
			     plugin to complete.
			     In this case we are asking the plugin to display
			     items from the syntax highlight group
			     'sqlKeyword'.
			     You can view a list of highlight group names to
			     choose from by executing the
				 :syntax list
			     command while editing a SQL file.
    'sqlKeyword'	   - Display the items for the sqlKeyword highlight
			     group
    'sqlKeyword\w*'	   - A second option available with Vim 7.4 which
                             uses a regular expression to determine which
			     syntax groups to use
    )<CR>		   - Execute the :let command
    <C-X><C-O>		   - Trigger the standard omni completion key stroke.
			     Passing in 'sqlKeyword' instructs the SQL
			     completion plugin to populate the popup with
			     items from the sqlKeyword highlight group.  The
			     plugin will also cache this result until Vim is
			     restarted.  The syntax list is retrieved using
			     the syntaxcomplete plugin.

Using the 'syntax' keyword is a special case.  This instructs the
syntaxcomplete plugin to retrieve all syntax items.  So this will effectively
work for any of Vim's SQL syntax files.  At the time of writing this includes
10 different syntax files for the different dialects of SQL (see section 3
above, |sql-dialects|).

Here are some examples of the entries which are pulled from the syntax files: >
     All
	 - Contains the contents of all syntax highlight groups
     Statements
	 - Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create, Alter, ...
     Functions
	 - Min, Max, Trim, Round, Date, ...
     Keywords
	 - Index, Database, Having, Group, With
     Options
	 - Isolation_level, On_error, Qualify_owners, Fire_triggers, ...
     Types
	 - Integer, Char, Varchar, Date, DateTime, Timestamp, ...


4.2 Dynamic Mode				*sql-completion-dynamic*
----------------
Dynamic mode populates the popups with data directly from a database.  In
order for the dynamic feature to be enabled you must have the dbext.vim
plugin installed, (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).

Dynamic mode is used by several features of the SQL completion plugin.
After installing the dbext plugin see the dbext-tutorial for additional
configuration and usage.  The dbext plugin allows the SQL completion plugin
to display a list of tables, procedures, views and columns. >
     Table List
	 - All tables for all schema owners
     Procedure List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     View List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     Column List
	 - For the selected table, the columns that are part of the table

To enable the popup, while in INSERT mode, use the following key combinations
for each group (where <C-C> means hold the CTRL key down while pressing
the space bar):
     Table List		   - <C-C>t
			   - <C-X><C-O> (the default map assumes tables)
     Stored Procedure List - <C-C>p
     View List		   - <C-C>v
     Column List	   - <C-C>c

     Drilling In / Out     - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of tables, you can press <Right>, this will
			     replace the table currently highlighted with
			     the column list for that table.
			   - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of columns, you can press <Left>, this will
			     replace the column list with the list of tables.
			   - This allows you to quickly drill down into a
			     table to view its columns and back again.
			   - <Right> and <Left> can be also be chosen via
			     your |.vimrc| >
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_right = '<Right>'
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_left  = '<Left>'

The SQL completion plugin caches various lists that are displayed in
the popup window.  This makes the re-displaying of these lists very
fast.  If new tables or columns are added to the database it may become
necessary to clear the plugins cache.  The default map for this is: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>R <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('ResetCache')<CR><C-X><C-O>


4.3 SQL Tutorial				*sql-completion-tutorial*
----------------

This tutorial is designed to take you through the common features of the SQL
completion plugin so that: >
     a) You gain familiarity with the plugin
     b) You are introduced to some of the more common features
     c) Show how to customize it to your preferences
     d) Demonstrate "Best of Use" of the plugin (easiest way to configure).

First, create a new buffer: >
     :e tutorial.sql


Static features
---------------
To take you through the various lists, simply enter insert mode, hit:
    <C-C>s   (show SQL statements)
At this point, you can page down through the list until you find "select".
If you are familiar with the item you are looking for, for example you know
the statement begins with the letter "s".  You can type ahead (without the
quotes) "se" then press:
    <C-Space>t
Assuming "select" is highlighted in the popup list press <Enter> to choose
the entry.  Now type:
    * fr<C-C>a (show all syntax items)
choose "from" from the popup list.

When writing stored procedures using the "type" list is useful.  It contains
a list of all the database supported types.  This may or may not be true
depending on the syntax file you are using.  The SQL Anywhere syntax file
(sqlanywhere.vim) has support for this: >
     BEGIN
	DECLARE customer_id <C-C>T <-- Choose a type from the list


Dynamic features
----------------
To take advantage of the dynamic features you must first install the
dbext.vim plugin (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).  It
also comes with a tutorial.  From the SQL completion plugin's perspective,
the main feature dbext provides is a connection to a database.  dbext
connection profiles are the most efficient mechanism to define connection
information.  Once connections have been setup, the SQL completion plugin
uses the features of dbext in the background to populate the popups.

What follows assumes dbext.vim has been correctly configured, a simple test
is to run the command, :DBListTable.  If a list of tables is shown, you know
dbext.vim is working as expected.  If not, please consult the dbext.txt
documentation.

Assuming you have followed the dbext-tutorial you can press <C-C>t to
display a list of tables.  There is a delay while dbext is creating the table
list.  After the list is displayed press <C-W>.  This will remove both the
popup window and the table name already chosen when the list became active. >

 4.3.1 Table Completion:			*sql-completion-tables*

Press <C-C>t to display a list of tables from within the database you
have connected via the dbext plugin.
NOTE: All of the SQL completion popups support typing a prefix before pressing
the key map.  This will limit the contents of the popup window to just items
beginning with those characters.  >

 4.3.2 Column Completion:			*sql-completion-columns*

The SQL completion plugin can also display a list of columns for particular
tables.  The column completion is trigger via <C-C>c.

NOTE: The following example uses <Right> to trigger a column list while
      the popup window is active.  

Example of using column completion:
     - Press <C-C>t again to display the list of tables.
     - When the list is displayed in the completion window, press <Right>,
       this will replace the list of tables, with a list of columns for the
       table highlighted (after the same short delay).
     - If you press <Left>, this will again replace the column list with the
       list of tables.  This allows you to drill into tables and column lists
       very quickly.
     - Press <Right> again while the same table is highlighted.  You will
       notice there is no delay since the column list has been cached.  If you
       change the schema of a cached table you can press <C-C>R, which
       clears the SQL completion cache.
     - NOTE: <Right> and <Left> have been designed to work while the
       completion window is active.  If the completion popup window is
       not active, a normal <Right> or <Left> will be executed.

Let's look at how we can build a SQL statement dynamically.  A select statement
requires a list of columns.  There are two ways to build a column list using
the SQL completion plugin. >
    One column at a time:
<       1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Choose a table from the list.
	3. Press <Right> to display a list of columns.
	4. Choose the column from the list and press enter.
	5. Enter a "," and press <C-C>c.  Generating a column list
	   generally requires having the cursor on a table name.  The plugin
	   uses this name to determine what table to retrieve the column list.
	   In this step, since we are pressing <C-C>c without the cursor
	   on a table name the column list displayed will be for the previous
	   table.  Choose a different column and move on.
	6. Repeat step 5 as often as necessary. >
    All columns for a table:
<	1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Highlight the table you need the column list for.
	3. Press <Enter> to choose the table from the list.
	4. Press <C-C>l to request a comma separated list of all columns
	   for this table.
	5. Based on the table name chosen in step 3, the plugin attempts to
	   decide on a reasonable table alias.	You are then prompted to
	   either accept of change the alias.  Press OK.
	6. The table name is replaced with the column list of the table is
	   replaced with the comma separate list of columns with the alias
	   prepended to each of the columns.
	7. Step 3 and 4 can be replaced by pressing <C-C>L, which has
	   a <C-Y> embedded in the map to choose the currently highlighted
	   table in the list.

There is a special provision when writing select statements.  Consider the
following statement: >
     select *
       from customer c,
	    contact cn,
	    department as dp,
	    employee e,
	    site_options so
      where c.

In INSERT mode after typing the final "c." which is an alias for the
"customer" table, you can press either <C-C>c or <C-X><C-O>.  This will
popup a list of columns for the customer table.  It does this by looking back
to the beginning of the select statement and finding a list of the tables
specified in the FROM clause.  In this case it notes that in the string
"customer c", "c" is an alias for the customer table.  The optional "AS"
keyword is also supported, "customer AS c". >


 4.3.3 Procedure Completion:			*sql-completion-procedures*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>p, will display a list of stored
procedures stored within the database. >

 4.3.4 View Completion:				*sql-completion-views*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>v, will display a list of views in the
database.


4.4 Completion Customization			*sql-completion-customization*
----------------------------

The SQL completion plugin can be customized through various options set in
your |vimrc|: >
    omni_sql_no_default_maps
<       - Default: This variable is not defined
	- If this variable is defined, no maps are created for OMNI
	  completion.  See |sql-completion-maps| for further discussion.
>
    omni_sql_use_tbl_alias
<	- Default: a
	- This setting is only used when generating a comma separated
	  column list.	By default the map is <C-C>l.  When generating
	  a column list, an alias can be prepended to the beginning of each
	  column, for example:	e.emp_id, e.emp_name.  This option has three
	  settings: >
		n - do not use an alias
		d - use the default (calculated) alias
		a - ask to confirm the alias name
<
	  An alias is determined following a few rules:
	       1.  If the table name has an '_', then use it as a separator: >
		   MY_TABLE_NAME --> MTN
		   my_table_name --> mtn
		   My_table_NAME --> MtN
<	       2.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', but DOES use
		   mixed case then the case is used as a separator: >
		   MyTableName --> MTN
<	       3.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', and does NOT
		   use mixed case then the first letter of the table is used: >
		   mytablename --> m
		   MYTABLENAME --> M

    omni_sql_ignorecase
<	- Default: Current setting for 'ignorecase'
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When entering a few letters before initiating completion, the list
	  will be filtered to display only the entries which begin with the
	  list of characters.  When this option is set to 0, the list will be
	  filtered using case sensitivity. >

    omni_sql_include_owner
<	- Default: 0, unless dbext.vim 3.00 has been installed
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When completing tables, procedure or views and using dbext.vim 3.00
	  or higher the list of objects will also include the owner name.
	  When completing these objects and omni_sql_include_owner is enabled
	  the owner name will be replaced. >

    omni_sql_precache_syntax_groups
<	- Default:
	  ['syntax','sqlKeyword','sqlFunction','sqlOption','sqlType','sqlStatement']
	- sqlcomplete can be used in conjunction with other completion
	  plugins.  This is outlined at |sql-completion-filetypes|.  When the
	  filetype is changed temporarily to SQL, the sqlcompletion plugin
	  will cache the syntax groups listed in the List specified in this
	  option.
>

4.5 SQL Maps					*sql-completion-maps*
------------

The default SQL maps have been described in other sections of this document in
greater detail.  Here is a list of the maps with a brief description of each.

Static Maps
-----------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using Vim's syntax
highlighting rules. >
    <C-C>a
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items. >
    <C-C>k
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlKeyword'. >
    <C-C>f
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlFunction. >
    <C-C>o
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlOption'. >
    <C-C>T
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlType'. >
    <C-C>s
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlStatement'. >

Dynamic Maps
------------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using the dbext.vim
plugin. >
    <C-C>t
<       - Displays a list of tables. >
    <C-C>p
<       - Displays a list of procedures. >
    <C-C>v
<       - Displays a list of views. >
    <C-C>c
<       - Displays a list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>l
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>L
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table.
	  This should only be used when the completion window is active. >
    <Right>
<	- Displays a list of columns for the table currently highlighted in
	  the completion window.  <Right> is not recognized on most Unix
	  systems, so this maps is only created on the Windows platform.
	  If you would like the same feature on Unix, choose a different key
	  and make the same map in your vimrc. >
    <Left>
<	- Displays the list of tables.
	  <Left> is not recognized on most Unix systems, so this maps is
	  only created on the Windows platform.  If you would like the same
	  feature on Unix, choose a different key and make the same map in
	  your vimrc. >
    <C-C>R
<	- This maps removes all cached items and forces the SQL completion
	  to regenerate the list of items.

Customizing Maps
----------------
You can create as many additional key maps as you like.  Generally, the maps
will be specifying different syntax highlight groups.

If you do not wish the default maps created or the key choices do not work on
your platform (often a case on *nix) you define the following variable in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:omni_sql_no_default_maps = 1

Do no edit ftplugin/sql.vim directly!  If you change this file your changes
will be over written on future updates.  Vim has a special directory structure
which allows you to make customizations without changing the files that are
included with the Vim distribution.  If you wish to customize the maps
create an after/ftplugin/sql.vim (see |after-directory|) and place the same
maps from the ftplugin/sql.vim in it using your own key strokes.  <C-C> was
chosen since it will work on both Windows and *nix platforms.  On the windows
platform you can also use <C-Space> or ALT keys.


4.6 Using with other filetypes			*sql-completion-filetypes*
------------------------------

Many times SQL can be used with different filetypes.  For example Perl, Java,
PHP, Javascript can all interact with a database.  Often you need both the SQL
completion and the completion capabilities for the current language you are
editing.

This can be enabled easily with the following steps (assuming a Perl file): >
    1.  :e test.pl
    2.  :set filetype=sql
    3.  :set ft=perl

Step 1
------
Begins by editing a Perl file.  Vim automatically sets the filetype to
"perl".  By default, Vim runs the appropriate filetype file
ftplugin/perl.vim.  If you are using the syntax completion plugin by following
the directions at |ft-syntax-omni| then the |'omnifunc'| option has been set to
"syntax#Complete".  Pressing <C-X><C-O> will display the omni popup containing
the syntax items for Perl.

Step 2
------
Manually setting the filetype to 'sql' will also fire the appropriate filetype
files ftplugin/sql.vim.  This file will define a number of buffer specific
maps for SQL completion, see |sql-completion-maps|.  Now these maps have
been created and the SQL completion plugin has been initialized.  All SQL
syntax items have been cached in preparation.  The SQL filetype script detects
we are attempting to use two different completion plugins.  Since the SQL maps
begin with <C-C>, the maps will toggle the |'omnifunc'| when in use.  So you
can use <C-X><C-O> to continue using the completion for Perl (using the syntax
completion plugin) and <C-C> to use the SQL completion features.

Step 3
------
Setting the filetype back to Perl sets all the usual "perl" related items back
as they were.

Vim's Graphical User Interface				*gui* *GUI*

1. Starting the GUI		|gui-start|
2. Scrollbars			|gui-scrollbars|
3. Mouse Control		|gui-mouse|
4. Making GUI Selections	|gui-selections|
5. Menus			|menus|
6. Extras			|gui-extras|
7. Shell Commands		|gui-shell|

Other GUI documentation:
|gui_x11.txt|	For specific items of the X11 GUI.
|gui_w32.txt|	For specific items of the Win32 GUI.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI				*gui-start* *E229* *E233*

First you must make sure you actually have a version of Vim with the GUI code
included.  You can check this with the ":version" command, it says "with xxx
GUI", where "xxx" is X11-Motif, X11-Athena, Photon, GTK, GTK2, etc., or
"MS-Windows 32 bit GUI version".

How to start the GUI depends on the system used.  Mostly you can run the
GUI version of Vim with:
    gvim [options] [files...]

The X11 version of Vim can run both in GUI and in non-GUI mode.  See
|gui-x11-start|.

			*gui-init* *gvimrc* *.gvimrc* *_gvimrc* *$MYGVIMRC*
The gvimrc file is where GUI-specific startup commands should be placed.  It
is always sourced after the |vimrc| file.  If you have one then the $MYGVIMRC
environment variable has its name.

When the GUI starts up initializations are carried out, in this order:
- The 'term' option is set to "builtin_gui" and terminal options are reset to
  their default value for the GUI |terminal-options|.
- If the system menu file exists, it is sourced.  The name of this file is
  normally "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim".  You can check this with ":version".  Also
  see |$VIMRUNTIME|.  To skip loading the system menu include 'M' in
  'guioptions'.				*buffers-menu* *no_buffers_menu*
  The system menu file includes a "Buffers" menu.  If you don't want this, set
  the "no_buffers_menu" variable in your .vimrc (not .gvimrc!): >
	:let no_buffers_menu = 1
< NOTE: Switching on syntax highlighting also loads the menu file, thus
  disabling the Buffers menu must be done before ":syntax on".
  The path names are truncated to 35 characters.  You can truncate them at a
  different length, for example 50, like this: >
	:let bmenu_max_pathlen = 50
- If the "-U {gvimrc}" command-line option has been used when starting Vim,
  the {gvimrc} file will be read for initializations.  The following
  initializations are skipped.  When {gvimrc} is "NONE" no file will be read
  for initializations.
- For Unix and MS-Windows, if the system gvimrc exists, it is sourced.  The
  name of this file is normally "$VIM/gvimrc".  You can check this with
  ":version".  Also see |$VIM|.
- The following are tried, and only the first one that exists is used:
  - If the GVIMINIT environment variable exists and is not empty, it is
    executed as an Ex command.
  - If the user gvimrc file exists, it is sourced.  The name of this file is
    normally "$HOME/.gvimrc".  You can check this with ":version".
  - For Win32, when $HOME is not set, "$VIM\_gvimrc" is used.
  - When a "_gvimrc" file is not found, ".gvimrc" is tried too.  And vice
    versa.
  The name of the first file found is stored in $MYGVIMRC, unless it was
  already set.
- If the 'exrc' option is set (which is NOT the default) the file ./.gvimrc
  is sourced, if it exists and isn't the same file as the system or user
  gvimrc file.  If this file is not owned by you, some security restrictions
  apply.  When ".gvimrc" is not found, "_gvimrc" is tried too.  For Macintosh
  and DOS/Win32 "_gvimrc" is tried first.

NOTE: All but the first one are not carried out if Vim was started with
"-u NONE" and no "-U" argument was given, or when started with "-U NONE".

All this happens AFTER the normal Vim initializations, like reading your
.vimrc file.  See |initialization|.
But the GUI window is only opened after all the initializations have been
carried out.  If you want some commands to be executed just after opening the
GUI window, use the |GUIEnter| autocommand event.  Example: >
	:autocmd GUIEnter * winpos 100 50

You can use the gvimrc files to set up your own customized menus (see |:menu|)
and initialize other things that you may want to set up differently from the
terminal version.

Recommended place for your personal GUI initializations:
	Unix		    $HOME/.gvimrc or $HOME/.vim/gvimrc
	OS/2		    $HOME/.gvimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/gvimrc
			    or $VIM/.gvimrc
	MS-DOS and Win32    $HOME/_gvimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/gvimrc
			    or $VIM/_gvimrc
	Amiga		    s:.gvimrc, home:.gvimrc, home:vimfiles:gvimrc
			    or $VIM/.gvimrc

The personal initialization files are searched in the order specified above
and only the first one that is found is read.

There are a number of options which only have meaning in the GUI version of
Vim.  These are 'guicursor', 'guifont', 'guipty' and 'guioptions'.  They are
documented in |options.txt| with all the other options.

If using the Motif or Athena version of the GUI (but not for the GTK+ or
Win32 version), a number of X resources are available.  See |gui-resources|.

Another way to set the colors for different occasions is with highlight
groups.  The "Normal" group is used to set the background and foreground
colors.  Example (which looks nice): >

	:highlight Normal guibg=grey90

The "guibg" and "guifg" settings override the normal background and
foreground settings.  The other settings for the Normal highlight group are
not used.  Use the 'guifont' option to set the font.

Also check out the 'guicursor' option, to set the colors for the cursor in
various modes.

Vim tries to make the window fit on the screen when it starts up.  This avoids
that you can't see part of it.  On the X Window System this requires a bit of
guesswork.  You can change the height that is used for the window title and a
task bar with the 'guiheadroom' option.

						*:winp* *:winpos* *E188*
:winp[os]
		Display current position of the top left corner of the GUI vim
		window in pixels.  Does not work in all versions.
		Also see |getwinposx()| and |getwinposy()|.

:winp[os] {X} {Y}							*E466*
		Put the GUI vim window at the given {X} and {Y} coordinates.
		The coordinates should specify the position in pixels of the
		top left corner of the window.  Does not work in all versions.
		Does work in an (new) xterm |xterm-color|.
		When the GUI window has not been opened yet, the values are
		remembered until the window is opened.  The position is
		adjusted to make the window fit on the screen (if possible).

						    *:win* *:winsize* *E465*
:win[size] {width} {height}
		Set the window height to {width} by {height} characters.
		Obsolete, use ":set lines=11 columns=22".
		If you get less lines than expected, check the 'guiheadroom'
		option.

If you are running the X Window System, you can get information about the
window Vim is running in with these commands: >
	:!xwininfo -id $WINDOWID
	:!xprop -id $WINDOWID
	:execute '!xwininfo -id ' . v:windowid
	:execute '!xprop -id ' . v:windowid
<
							*gui-IME* *iBus*
Input methods for international characters in X that rely on the XIM
framework, most notably iBus, have been known to produce undesirable results
in gVim. These may include an inability to enter spaces, or long delays
between typing a character and it being recognized by the application.

One workaround that has been successful, for unknown reasons, is to prevent
gvim from forking into the background by starting it with the |-f| argument.

==============================================================================
2. Scrollbars						*gui-scrollbars*

There are vertical scrollbars and a horizontal scrollbar.  You may
configure which ones appear with the 'guioptions' option.

The interface looks like this (with ":set guioptions=mlrb"):

		       +------------------------------+ `
		       | File  Edit		 Help | <- Menu bar (m) `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+ `
		       |^|			    |^| `
		       |#| Text area.		    |#| `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |v|__________________________|v| `
 Normal status line -> |-+ File.c	       5,2  +-| `
 between Vim windows   |^|""""""""""""""""""""""""""|^| `
		       | |			    | | `
		       | | Another file buffer.     | | `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |#|			    |#| `
 Left scrollbar (l) -> |#|			    |#| <- Right `
		       |#|			    |#|    scrollbar (r) `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |v|			    |v| `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+ `
		       | |< ####		   >| | <- Bottom `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+    scrollbar (b) `

Any of the scrollbar or menu components may be turned off by not putting the
appropriate letter in the 'guioptions' string.  The bottom scrollbar is
only useful when 'nowrap' is set.


VERTICAL SCROLLBARS					*gui-vert-scroll*

Each Vim window has a scrollbar next to it which may be scrolled up and down
to move through the text in that buffer.  The size of the scrollbar-thumb
indicates the fraction of the buffer which can be seen in the window.
When the scrollbar is dragged all the way down, the last line of the file
will appear in the top of the window.

If a window is shrunk to zero height (by the growth of another window) its
scrollbar disappears.  It reappears when the window is restored.

If a window is vertically split, it will get a scrollbar when it is the
current window and when, taking the middle of the current window and drawing a
vertical line, this line goes through the window.
When there are scrollbars on both sides, and the middle of the current window
is on the left half, the right scrollbar column will contain scrollbars for
the rightmost windows.  The same happens on the other side.


HORIZONTAL SCROLLBARS					*gui-horiz-scroll*

The horizontal scrollbar (at the bottom of the Vim GUI) may be used to
scroll text sideways when the 'wrap' option is turned off.  The
scrollbar-thumb size is such that the text of the longest visible line may be
scrolled as far as possible left and right.  The cursor is moved when
necessary, it must remain on a visible character (unless 'virtualedit' is
set).

Computing the length of the longest visible line takes quite a bit of
computation, and it has to be done every time something changes.  If this
takes too much time or you don't like the cursor jumping to another line,
include the 'h' flag in 'guioptions'.  Then the scrolling is limited by the
text of the current cursor line.

							*athena-intellimouse*
If you have an Intellimouse and an X server that supports using the wheel,
then you can use the wheel to scroll the text up and down in gvim.  This works
with XFree86 4.0 and later, and with some older versions when you add patches.
See |scroll-mouse-wheel|.

For older versions of XFree86 you must patch your X server.  The following
page has a bit of information about using the Intellimouse on Linux as well as
links to the patches and X server binaries (may not have the one you need
though):

==============================================================================
3. Mouse Control					*gui-mouse*

The mouse only works if the appropriate flag in the 'mouse' option is set.
When the GUI is switched on, and 'mouse' wasn't set yet, the 'mouse' option is
automatically set to "a", enabling it for all modes except for the
|hit-enter| prompt.  If you don't want this, a good place to change the
'mouse' option is the "gvimrc" file.

Other options that are relevant:
'mousefocus'	window focus follows mouse pointer |gui-mouse-focus|
'mousemodel'	what mouse button does which action
'mousehide'	hide mouse pointer while typing text
'selectmode'	whether to start Select mode or Visual mode

A quick way to set these is with the ":behave" command.
							*:behave* *:be*
:be[have] {model}	Set behavior for mouse and selection.  Valid
			arguments are:
			   mswin	MS-Windows behavior
			   xterm	Xterm behavior

			Using ":behave" changes these options:
			option		mswin			xterm	~
			'selectmode'	"mouse,key"		""
			'mousemodel'	"popup"			"extend"
			'keymodel'	"startsel,stopsel"	""
			'selection'	"exclusive"		"inclusive"

In the $VIMRUNTIME directory, there is a script called |mswin.vim|, which will
also map a few keys to the MS-Windows cut/copy/paste commands.  This is NOT
compatible, since it uses the CTRL-V, CTRL-X and CTRL-C keys.  If you don't
mind, use this command: >
	:so $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

For scrolling with a wheel on a mouse, see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.


3.1 Moving Cursor with Mouse				*gui-mouse-move*

Click the left mouse button somewhere in a text buffer where you want the
cursor to go, and it does!
This works in	    when 'mouse' contains ~
Normal mode	    'n' or 'a'
Visual mode	    'v' or 'a'
Insert mode	    'i' or 'a'

Select mode is handled like Visual mode.

You may use this with an operator such as 'd' to delete text from the current
cursor position to the position you point to with the mouse.  That is, you hit
'd' and then click the mouse somewhere.

							*gui-mouse-focus*
The 'mousefocus' option can be set to make the keyboard focus follow the
mouse pointer.  This means that the window where the mouse pointer is, is the
active window.  Warning: this doesn't work very well when using a menu,
because the menu command will always be applied to the top window.

If you are on the ':' line (or '/' or '?'), then clicking the left or right
mouse button will position the cursor on the ':' line (if 'mouse' contains
'c', 'a' or 'A').

In any situation the middle mouse button may be clicked to paste the current
selection.


3.2 Selection with Mouse				*gui-mouse-select*

The mouse can be used to start a selection.  How depends on the 'mousemodel'
option:
'mousemodel' is "extend": use the right mouse button
'mousemodel' is "popup":  use the left mouse button, while keeping the Shift
key pressed.

If there was no selection yet, this starts a selection from the old cursor
position to the position pointed to with the mouse.  If there already is a
selection then the closest end will be extended.

If 'selectmode' contains "mouse", then the selection will be in Select mode.
This means that typing normal text will replace the selection.  See
|Select-mode|.  Otherwise, the selection will be in Visual mode.

Double clicking may be done to make the selection word-wise, triple clicking
makes it line-wise, and quadruple clicking makes it rectangular block-wise.

See |gui-selections| on how the selection is used.


3.3 Other Text Selection with Mouse		*gui-mouse-modeless*
						*modeless-selection*
A different kind of selection is used when:
- in Command-line mode
- in the Command-line window and pointing in another window
- at the |hit-enter| prompt
- whenever the current mode is not in the 'mouse' option
- when holding the CTRL and SHIFT keys in the GUI

Since Vim continues like the selection isn't there, and there is no mode
associated with the selection, this is called modeless selection.  Any text in
the Vim window can be selected.  Select the text by pressing the left mouse
button at the start, drag to the end and release.  To extend the selection,
use the right mouse button when 'mousemodel' is "extend", or the left mouse
button with the shift key pressed when 'mousemodel' is "popup".
The selection is removed when the selected text is scrolled or changed.

On the command line CTRL-Y can be used to copy the selection into the
clipboard.  To do this from Insert mode, use CTRL-O : CTRL-Y <CR>.  When
'guioptions' contains a or A (default on X11), the selection is automatically
copied to the "* register.

The middle mouse button can then paste the text.  On non-X11 systems, you can
use CTRL-R +.


3.4 Using Mouse on Status Lines				*gui-mouse-status*

Clicking the left or right mouse button on the status line below a Vim
window makes that window the current window.  This actually happens on button
release (to be able to distinguish a click from a drag action).

With the left mouse button a status line can be dragged up and down, thus
resizing the windows above and below it.  This does not change window focus.

The same can be used on the vertical separator: click to give the window left
of it focus, drag left and right to make windows wider and narrower.


3.5 Various Mouse Clicks				*gui-mouse-various*

    <S-LeftMouse>	Search forward for the word under the mouse click.
			When 'mousemodel' is "popup" this starts or extends a
			selection.
    <S-RightMouse>	Search backward for the word under the mouse click.
    <C-LeftMouse>	Jump to the tag name under the mouse click.
    <C-RightMouse>	Jump back to position before the previous tag jump
			(same as "CTRL-T")


3.6 Mouse Mappings					*gui-mouse-mapping*

The mouse events, complete with modifiers, may be mapped.  Eg: >
   :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>
   :map <S-LeftDrag>      <RightDrag>
   :map <S-LeftRelease>   <RightRelease>
   :map <2-S-LeftMouse>   <2-RightMouse>
   :map <2-S-LeftDrag>    <2-RightDrag>
   :map <2-S-LeftRelease> <2-RightRelease>
   :map <3-S-LeftMouse>   <3-RightMouse>
   :map <3-S-LeftDrag>    <3-RightDrag>
   :map <3-S-LeftRelease> <3-RightRelease>
   :map <4-S-LeftMouse>   <4-RightMouse>
   :map <4-S-LeftDrag>    <4-RightDrag>
   :map <4-S-LeftRelease> <4-RightRelease>
These mappings make selection work the way it probably should in a Motif
application, with shift-left mouse allowing for extending the visual area
rather than the right mouse button.

Mouse mapping with modifiers does not work for modeless selection.


3.7 Drag and drop						*drag-n-drop*

You can drag and drop one or more files into the Vim window, where they will
be opened as if a |:drop| command was used.

If you hold down Shift while doing this, Vim changes to the first dropped
file's directory.  If you hold Ctrl Vim will always split a new window for the
file.  Otherwise it's only done if the current buffer has been changed.

You can also drop a directory on Vim.  This starts the explorer plugin for
that directory (assuming it was enabled, otherwise you'll get an error
message).  Keep Shift pressed to change to the directory instead.

If Vim happens to be editing a command line, the names of the dropped files
and directories will be inserted at the cursor.  This allows you to use these
names with any Ex command.  Special characters (space, tab, double quote and
'|'; backslash on non-MS-Windows systems) will be escaped.

==============================================================================
4. Making GUI Selections				*gui-selections*

							*quotestar*
You may make selections with the mouse (see |gui-mouse-select|), or by using
Vim's Visual mode (see |v|).  If 'a' is present in 'guioptions', then
whenever a selection is started (Visual or Select mode), or when the selection
is changed, Vim becomes the owner of the windowing system's primary selection
(on MS-Windows the |gui-clipboard| is used; under X11, the |x11-selection| is
used - you should read whichever of these is appropriate now).

							*clipboard*
There is a special register for storing this selection, it is the "*
register.  Nothing is put in here unless the information about what text is
selected is about to change (e.g. with a left mouse click somewhere), or when
another application wants to paste the selected text.  Then the text is put
in the "* register.  For example, to cut a line and make it the current
selection/put it on the clipboard: >

	"*dd

Similarly, when you want to paste a selection from another application, e.g.,
by clicking the middle mouse button, the selection is put in the "* register
first, and then 'put' like any other register.  For example, to put the
selection (contents of the clipboard): >

	"*p

When using this register under X11, also see |x11-selection|.  This also
explains the related "+ register.

Note that when pasting text from one Vim into another separate Vim, the type
of selection (character, line, or block) will also be copied.  For other
applications the type is always character.  However, if the text gets
transferred via the |x11-cut-buffer|, the selection type is ALWAYS lost.

When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
register is the same as the "* register.  Thus you can yank to and paste the
selection without prepending "* to commands.

==============================================================================
5. Menus						*menus*

For an introduction see |usr_42.txt| in the user manual.


5.1 Using Menus						*using-menus*

Basically, menus can be used just like mappings.  You can define your own
menus, as many as you like.
Long-time Vim users won't use menus much.  But the power is in adding your own
menus and menu items.  They are most useful for things that you can't remember
what the key sequence was.

For creating menus in a different language, see |:menutrans|.

							*menu.vim*
The default menus are read from the file "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim".  See
|$VIMRUNTIME| for where the path comes from.  You can set up your own menus.
Starting off with the default set is a good idea.  You can add more items, or,
if you don't like the defaults at all, start with removing all menus
|:unmenu-all|.  You can also avoid the default menus being loaded by adding
this line to your .vimrc file (NOT your .gvimrc file!): >
	:let did_install_default_menus = 1
If you also want to avoid the Syntax menu: >
	:let did_install_syntax_menu = 1
The first item in the Syntax menu can be used to show all available filetypes
in the menu (which can take a bit of time to load).  If you want to have all
filetypes already present at startup, add: >
	:let do_syntax_sel_menu = 1

<
							*console-menus*
Although this documentation is in the GUI section, you can actually use menus
in console mode too.  You will have to load |menu.vim| explicitly then, it is
not done by default.  You can use the |:emenu| command and command-line
completion with 'wildmenu' to access the menu entries almost like a real menu
system.  To do this, put these commands in your .vimrc file: >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
	:set wildmenu
	:set cpo-=<
	:set wcm=<C-Z>
	:map <F4> :emenu <C-Z>
Pressing <F4> will start the menu.  You can now use the cursor keys to select
a menu entry.  Hit <Enter> to execute it.  Hit <Esc> if you want to cancel.
This does require the |+menu| feature enabled at compile time.

							*tear-off-menus*
GTK+ and Motif support Tear-off menus.  These are sort of sticky menus or
pop-up menus that are present all the time.  If the resizing does not work
correctly, this may be caused by using something like "Vim*geometry" in the
defaults.  Use "Vim.geometry" instead.

The Win32 GUI version emulates Motif's tear-off menus.  Actually, a Motif user
will spot the differences easily, but hopefully they're just as useful.  You
can also use the |:tearoff| command together with |hidden-menus| to create
floating menus that do not appear on the main menu bar.


5.2 Creating New Menus					*creating-menus*

				*:me*  *:menu*  *:noreme*  *:noremenu*
				*:am*  *:amenu* *:an*      *:anoremenu*
				*:nme* *:nmenu* *:nnoreme* *:nnoremenu*
				*:ome* *:omenu* *:onoreme* *:onoremenu*
				*:vme* *:vmenu* *:vnoreme* *:vnoremenu*
				*:xme* *:xmenu* *:xnoreme* *:xnoremenu*
				*:sme* *:smenu* *:snoreme* *:snoremenu*
				*:ime* *:imenu* *:inoreme* *:inoremenu*
				*:cme* *:cmenu* *:cnoreme* *:cnoremenu*
				*E330* *E327* *E331* *E336* *E333*
				*E328* *E329* *E337* *E792*
To create a new menu item, use the ":menu" commands.  They are mostly like
the ":map" set of commands but the first argument is a menu item name, given
as a path of menus and submenus with a '.' between them, e.g.: >

   :menu File.Save  :w<CR>
   :inoremenu File.Save  <C-O>:w<CR>
   :menu Edit.Big\ Changes.Delete\ All\ Spaces  :%s/[ ^I]//g<CR>

This last one will create a new item in the menu bar called "Edit", holding
the mouse button down on this will pop up a menu containing the item
"Big Changes", which is a sub-menu containing the item "Delete All Spaces",
which when selected, performs the operation.

Special characters in a menu name:

	&	The next character is the shortcut key.  Make sure each
		shortcut key is only used once in a (sub)menu.  If you want to
		insert a literal "&" in the menu name use "&&".
	<Tab>	Separates the menu name from right-aligned text.  This can be
		used to show the equivalent typed command.  The text "<Tab>"
		can be used here for convenience.  If you are using a real
		tab, don't forget to put a backslash before it!
Example: >

   :amenu &File.&Open<Tab>:e  :browse e<CR>

[typed literally]
With the shortcut "F" (while keeping the <Alt> key pressed), and then "O",
this menu can be used.  The second part is shown as "Open     :e".  The ":e"
is right aligned, and the "O" is underlined, to indicate it is the shortcut.

The ":amenu" command can be used to define menu entries for all modes at once.
To make the command work correctly, a character is automatically inserted for
some modes:
	mode		inserted	appended	~
	Normal		nothing		nothing
	Visual		<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>
	Insert		<C-\><C-O>
	Cmdline		<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>
	Op-pending	<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>

Appending CTRL-\ CTRL-G is for going back to insert mode when 'insertmode' is
set. |CTRL-\_CTRL-G|

Example: >

   :amenu File.Next	:next^M

is equal to: >

   :nmenu File.Next	:next^M
   :vmenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G
   :imenu File.Next	^\^O:next^M
   :cmenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G
   :omenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G

Careful: In Insert mode this only works for a SINGLE Normal mode command,
because of the CTRL-O.  If you have two or more commands, you will need to use
the ":imenu" command.  For inserting text in any mode, you can use the
expression register: >

   :amenu Insert.foobar   "='foobar'<CR>P

Note that the '<' and 'k' flags in 'cpoptions' also apply here (when
included they make the <> form and raw key codes not being recognized).

Note that <Esc> in Cmdline mode executes the command, like in a mapping.  This
is Vi compatible.  Use CTRL-C to quit Cmdline mode.

						*:menu-<silent>* *:menu-silent*
To define a menu which will not be echoed on the command line, add
"<silent>" as the first argument.  Example: >
	:menu <silent> Settings.Ignore\ case  :set ic<CR>
The ":set ic" will not be echoed when using this menu.  Messages from the
executed command are still given though.  To shut them up too, add a ":silent"
in the executed command: >
	:menu <silent> Search.Header :exe ":silent normal /Header\r"<CR>
"<silent>" may also appear just after "<special>" or "<script>".

					*:menu-<special>* *:menu-special*
Define a menu with <> notation for special keys, even though the "<" flag
may appear in 'cpoptions'.  This is useful if the side effect of setting
'cpoptions' is not desired.  Example: >
	:menu <special> Search.Header /Header<CR>
"<special>" must appear as the very first argument to the ":menu" command or
just after "<silent>" or "<script>".

						*:menu-<script>* *:menu-script*
The "to" part of the menu will be inspected for mappings.  If you don't want
this, use the ":noremenu" command (or the similar one for a specific mode).
If you do want to use script-local mappings, add "<script>" as the very first
argument to the ":menu" command or just after "<silent>" or "<special>".

							*menu-priority*
You can give a priority to a menu.  Menus with a higher priority go more to
the right.  The priority is given as a number before the ":menu" command.
Example: >
	:80menu Buffer.next :bn<CR>

The default menus have these priorities:
	File		10
	Edit		20
	Tools		40
	Syntax		50
	Buffers		60
	Window		70
	Help		9999

When no or zero priority is given, 500 is used.
The priority for the PopUp menu is not used.

The Help menu will be placed on the far right side of the menu bar on systems
which support this (Motif and GTK+).  For GTK+ 2, this is not done anymore
because right-aligning the Help menu is now discouraged UI design.

You can use a priority higher than 9999, to make it go after the Help menu,
but that is non-standard and is discouraged.  The highest possible priority is
about 32000.  The lowest is 1.

							*sub-menu-priority*
The same mechanism can be used to position a sub-menu.  The priority is then
given as a dot-separated list of priorities, before the menu name: >
	:menu 80.500 Buffer.next :bn<CR>
Giving the sub-menu priority is only needed when the item is not to be put
in a normal position.  For example, to put a sub-menu before the other items: >
	:menu 80.100 Buffer.first :brew<CR>
Or to put a sub-menu after the other items, and further items with default
priority will be put before it: >
	:menu 80.900 Buffer.last :blast<CR>
When a number is missing, the default value 500 will be used: >
	:menu .900 myMenu.test :echo "text"<CR>
The menu priority is only used when creating a new menu.  When it already
existed, e.g., in another mode, the priority will not change.  Thus, the
priority only needs to be given the first time a menu is used.
An exception is the PopUp menu.  There is a separate menu for each mode
(Normal, Op-pending, Visual, Insert, Cmdline).  The order in each of these
menus can be different.  This is different from menu-bar menus, which have
the same order for all modes.
NOTE: sub-menu priorities currently don't work for all versions of the GUI.

							*menu-separator* *E332*
Menu items can be separated by a special item that inserts some space between
items.  Depending on the system this is displayed as a line or a dotted line.
These items must start with a '-' and end in a '-'.  The part in between is
used to give it a unique name.  Priorities can be used as with normal items.
Example: >
	:menu Example.item1	:do something
	:menu Example.-Sep-	:
	:menu Example.item2	:do something different
Note that the separator also requires a rhs.  It doesn't matter what it is,
because the item will never be selected.  Use a single colon to keep it
simple.

							*gui-toolbar*
The toolbar is currently available in the Win32, Athena, Motif, GTK+ (X11),
and Photon GUI.  It should turn up in other GUIs in due course.  The
default toolbar is setup in menu.vim.
The display of the toolbar is controlled by the 'guioptions' letter 'T'.  You
can thus have menu & toolbar together, or either on its own, or neither.
The appearance is controlled by the 'toolbar' option.  You can choose between
an image, text or both.

							*toolbar-icon*
The toolbar is defined as a special menu called ToolBar, which only has one
level.  Vim interprets the items in this menu as follows:
1)  If an "icon=" argument was specified, the file with this name is used.
    The file can either be specified with the full path or with the base name.
    In the last case it is searched for in the "bitmaps" directory in
    'runtimepath', like in point 3.  Examples: >
	:amenu icon=/usr/local/pixmaps/foo_icon.xpm ToolBar.Foo :echo "Foo"<CR>
	:amenu icon=FooIcon ToolBar.Foo :echo "Foo"<CR>
<   Note that in the first case the extension is included, while in the second
    case it is omitted.
    If the file cannot be opened the next points are tried.
    A space in the file name must be escaped with a backslash.
    A menu priority must come _after_ the icon argument: >
	:amenu icon=foo 1.42 ToolBar.Foo :echo "42!"<CR>
2)  An item called 'BuiltIn##', where ## is a number, is taken as number ## of
    the built-in bitmaps available in Vim.  Currently there are 31 numbered
    from 0 to 30 which cover most common editing operations |builtin-tools|. >
	:amenu ToolBar.BuiltIn22 :call SearchNext("back")<CR>
3)  An item with another name is first searched for in the directory
    "bitmaps" in 'runtimepath'.  If found, the bitmap file is used as the
    toolbar button image.  Note that the exact filename is OS-specific: For
    example, under Win32 the command >
	:amenu ToolBar.Hello :echo "hello"<CR>
<   would find the file 'hello.bmp'.  Under GTK+/X11 it is 'Hello.xpm'.  With
    GTK+ 2 the files 'Hello.png', 'Hello.xpm' and 'Hello.bmp' are checked for
    existence, and the first one found would be used.
    For MS-Windows and GTK+ 2 the bitmap is scaled to fit the button.  For
    MS-Windows a size of 18 by 18 pixels works best.
    For MS-Windows the bitmap should have 16 colors with the standard palette.
    The light grey pixels will be changed to the Window frame color and the
    dark grey pixels to the window shadow color.  More colors might also work,
    depending on your system.
4)  If the bitmap is still not found, Vim checks for a match against its list
    of built-in names.  Each built-in button image has a name.
    So the command >
	:amenu ToolBar.Open :e
<   will show the built-in "open a file" button image if no open.bmp exists.
    All the built-in names can be seen used in menu.vim.
5)  If all else fails, a blank, but functioning, button is displayed.

					*hidden-menus* *win32-hidden-menus*
In the Win32 and GTK+ GUI, starting a menu name with ']' excludes that menu
from the main menu bar.  You must then use the |:popup| or |:tearoff| command
to display it.

							*popup-menu*
In the Win32, GTK+, Motif, Athena and Photon GUI, you can define the
special menu "PopUp".  This is the menu that is displayed when the right mouse
button is pressed, if 'mousemodel' is set to popup or popup_setpos.


5.3 Showing What Menus Are Mapped To			*showing-menus*

To see what an existing menu is mapped to, use just one argument after the
menu commands (just like you would with the ":map" commands).  If the menu
specified is a submenu, then all menus under that hierarchy will be shown.
If no argument is given after :menu at all, then ALL menu items are shown
for the appropriate mode (e.g., Command-line mode for :cmenu).

Special characters in the list, just before the rhs:
*	The menu was defined with "nore" to disallow remapping.
&	The menu was defined with "<script>" to allow remapping script-local
	mappings only.
-	The menu was disabled.

Note that hitting <Tab> while entering a menu name after a menu command may
be used to complete the name of the menu item.


5.4 Executing Menus					*execute-menus*

						*:em*  *:emenu* *E334* *E335*
:[range]em[enu] {menu}		Execute {menu} from the command line.
				The default is to execute the Normal mode
				menu.  If a range is specified, it executes
				the Visual mode menu.
				If used from <c-o>, it executes the
				insert-mode menu Eg: >
	:emenu File.Exit

If the console-mode vim has been compiled with WANT_MENU defined, you can
use :emenu to access useful menu items you may have got used to from GUI
mode.  See 'wildmenu' for an option that works well with this.  See
|console-menus| for an example.

When using a range, if the lines match with '<,'>, then the menu is executed
using the last visual selection.


5.5 Deleting Menus					*delete-menus*

						*:unme*  *:unmenu*
						*:aun*   *:aunmenu*
						*:nunme* *:nunmenu*
						*:ounme* *:ounmenu*
						*:vunme* *:vunmenu*
						*:xunme* *:xunmenu*
						*:sunme* *:sunmenu*
						*:iunme* *:iunmenu*
						*:cunme* *:cunmenu*
To delete a menu item or a whole submenu, use the unmenu commands, which are
analogous to the unmap commands.  Eg: >
    :unmenu! Edit.Paste

This will remove the Paste item from the Edit menu for Insert and
Command-line modes.

Note that hitting <Tab> while entering a menu name after an umenu command
may be used to complete the name of the menu item for the appropriate mode.

To remove all menus use:			*:unmenu-all*  >
	:unmenu *	" remove all menus in Normal and visual mode
	:unmenu! *	" remove all menus in Insert and Command-line mode
	:aunmenu *	" remove all menus in all modes

If you want to get rid of the menu bar: >
	:set guioptions-=m


5.6 Disabling Menus					*disable-menus*

						*:menu-disable* *:menu-enable*
If you do not want to remove a menu, but disable it for a moment, this can be
done by adding the "enable" or "disable" keyword to a ":menu" command.
Examples: >
	:menu disable &File.&Open\.\.\.
	:amenu enable *
	:amenu disable &Tools.*

The command applies to the modes as used with all menu commands.  Note that
characters like "&" need to be included for translated names to be found.
When the argument is "*", all menus are affected.  Otherwise the given menu
name and all existing submenus below it are affected.


5.7 Examples for Menus					*menu-examples*

Here is an example on how to add menu items with menu's!  You can add a menu
item for the keyword under the cursor.  The register "z" is used. >

  :nmenu Words.Add\ Var		wb"zye:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z<CR>
  :nmenu Words.Remove\ Var	wb"zye:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>
  :vmenu Words.Add\ Var		"zy:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z <CR>
  :vmenu Words.Remove\ Var	"zy:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>
  :imenu Words.Add\ Var		<Esc>wb"zye:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z<CR>a
  :imenu Words.Remove\ Var	<Esc>wb"zye:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>a

(the rhs is in <> notation, you can copy/paste this text to try out the
mappings, or put these lines in your gvimrc; "<C-R>" is CTRL-R, "<CR>" is
the <CR> key.  |<>|)


5.8 Tooltips & Menu tips

See section |42.4| in the user manual.

							*:tmenu* *:tm*
:tm[enu] {menupath} {rhs}	Define a tip for a menu or tool.  {only in
				X11 and Win32 GUI}

:tm[enu] [menupath]		List menu tips. {only in X11 and Win32 GUI}

							*:tunmenu* *:tu*
:tu[nmenu] {menupath}		Remove a tip for a menu or tool.
				{only in X11 and Win32 GUI}

When a tip is defined for a menu item, it appears in the command-line area
when the mouse is over that item, much like a standard Windows menu hint in
the status bar.  (Except when Vim is in Command-line mode, when of course
nothing is displayed.)
When a tip is defined for a ToolBar item, it appears as a tooltip when the
mouse pauses over that button, in the usual fashion.  Use the |hl-Tooltip|
highlight group to change its colors.

A "tip" can be defined for each menu item.  For example, when defining a menu
item like this: >
	:amenu MyMenu.Hello :echo "Hello"<CR>
The tip is defined like this: >
	:tmenu MyMenu.Hello Displays a greeting.
And delete it with: >
	:tunmenu MyMenu.Hello

Tooltips are currently only supported for the X11 and Win32 GUI.  However, they
should appear for the other gui platforms in the not too distant future.

The ":tmenu" command works just like other menu commands, it uses the same
arguments.  ":tunmenu" deletes an existing menu tip, in the same way as the
other unmenu commands.

If a menu item becomes invalid (i.e. its actions in all modes are deleted) Vim
deletes the menu tip (and the item) for you.  This means that :aunmenu deletes
a menu item - you don't need to do a :tunmenu as well.


5.9 Popup Menus

In the Win32 and GTK+ GUI, you can cause a menu to popup at the cursor.
This behaves similarly to the PopUp menus except that any menu tree can
be popped up.

This command is for backwards compatibility, using it is discouraged, because
it behaves in a strange way.

							*:popup* *:popu*
:popu[p] {name}			Popup the menu {name}.  The menu named must
				have at least one subentry, but need not
				appear on the menu-bar (see |hidden-menus|).
				{only available for Win32 and GTK GUI}

:popu[p]! {name}		Like above, but use the position of the mouse
				pointer instead of the cursor.

Example: >
	:popup File
will make the "File" menu (if there is one) appear at the text cursor (mouse
pointer if ! was used). >

	:amenu ]Toolbar.Make	:make<CR>
	:popup ]Toolbar
This creates a popup menu that doesn't exist on the main menu-bar.

Note that a menu that starts with ']' will not be displayed.

==============================================================================
6. Extras						*gui-extras*

This section describes other features which are related to the GUI.

- With the GUI, there is no wait for one second after hitting escape, because
  the key codes don't start with <Esc>.

- Typing ^V followed by a special key in the GUI will insert "<Key>", since
  the internal string used is meaningless.  Modifiers may also be held down to
  get "<Modifiers-Key>".

- In the GUI, the modifiers SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT (or META) may be used within
  mappings of special keys and mouse events.  E.g.: :map <M-LeftDrag> <LeftDrag>

- In the GUI, several normal keys may have modifiers in mappings etc, these
  are <Space>, <Tab>, <NL>, <CR>, <Esc>.

- To check in a Vim script if the GUI is being used, you can use something
  like this: >

	if has("gui_running")
	   echo "yes, we have a GUI"
	else
	   echo "Boring old console"
	endif
<							*setting-guifont*
- When you use the same vimrc file on various systems, you can use something
  like this to set options specifically for each type of GUI: >

	if has("gui_running")
	    if has("gui_gtk2")
		:set guifont=Luxi\ Mono\ 12
	    elseif has("x11")
		" Also for GTK 1
		:set guifont=*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-m-*-*
	    elseif has("gui_win32")
		:set guifont=Luxi_Mono:h12:cANSI
	    endif
	endif

A recommended Japanese font is MS Mincho.  You can find info here:
http://www.lexikan.com/mincho.htm

==============================================================================
7. Shell Commands					*gui-shell*

For the X11 GUI the external commands are executed inside the gvim window.
See |gui-pty|.

WARNING: Executing an external command from the X11 GUI will not always
work.  "normal" commands like "ls", "grep" and "make" mostly work fine.
Commands that require an intelligent terminal like "less" and "ispell" won't
work.  Some may even hang and need to be killed from another terminal.  So be
careful!

For the Win32 GUI the external commands are executed in a separate window.
See |gui-shell-win32|.

Vim's Graphical User Interface				*gui-w16* *win16-gui*

1. Starting the GUI		|win16-start|
2. Vim as default editor	|win16-default-editor|
3. Using the clipboard		|win16-clipboard|
4. Shell Commands		|win16-shell|
5. Special colors		|win16-colors|
6. Windows dialogs & browsers	|win16-dialogs|
7. Various			|win16-various|

Other relevant documentation:
|gui.txt|	For generic items of the GUI.
|os_msdos.txt|	For items common to DOS and Windows.
|gui_w32.txt|	Some items here are also applicable to the Win16 version.

{Vi does not have a Windows GUI}

The Win16 version of Vim will run on Windows 3.1 or later.  It has not been
tested on 3.0, it probably won't work without being recompiled and
modified.  (But you really should upgrade to 3.11 anyway. :)

In most respects it behaves identically to the Win32 GUI version, including
having a flat-style toolbar(!).  The chief differences:

1) Bold/Italic text is not available, to speed up repaint/reduce resource
   usage.  (You can re-instate this by undefining MSWIN16_FASTTEXT.)
2) No tearoff menu emulation.
3) No OLE interface.
4) No long filename support (of course).
5) No tooltips on toolbar buttons - instead they produce command-line tips
   like menu items do.
6) Line length limited to 32767 characters (like 16-bit DOS version).


==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI					*win16-start*

The Win16 GUI version of Vim will always start the GUI, no matter how you
start it or what it's called.  There is no 'console' version as such, but you
can use one of the DOS versions in a DOS box.

The Win16 GUI has an extra menu item:  "Window/Select Font".  It brings up the
standard Windows font selector.  Note that bold and italic fonts are not
supported in an attempt to maximize GDI drawing speed.

Setting the menu height doesn't work for the Win16 GUI.

							*win16-maximized*
If you want Vim to start with a maximized window, add this command to your
vimrc or gvimrc file: >
	au GUIEnter * simalt ~x
<

There is a specific version of gvim.exe that runs under the Win32s subsystem
of Windows 3.1 or 3.11.  See |win32s|.

==============================================================================
2. Vim as default editor				*win16-default-editor*

To set Vim as the default editor for a file type you can use File Manager's
"Associate" feature.

When you open a file in Vim by double clicking it, Vim changes to that
file's directory.

See also |notepad|.

==============================================================================
3. Using the clipboard					*win16-clipboard*

Windows has a clipboard, where you can copy text to, and paste text from.  Vim
supports this in several ways.
The clipboard works in the same way as the Win32 version: see |gui-clipboard|.

==============================================================================
4. Shell Commands					*win16-shell*

Vim spawns a DOS window for external commands, to make it possible to run any
DOS command.  The window uses the _default.pif settings.

							*win16-!start*
Normally, Vim waits for a command to complete before continuing (this makes
sense for most shell commands which produce output for Vim to use).  If you
want Vim to start a program and return immediately, you can use the following
syntax:
	:!start {command}
This may only work for a Windows program though.
Don't forget that you must tell Windows 3.1x to keep executing a DOS command
in the background while you switch back to Vim.

==============================================================================
5. Special colors					*win16-colors*

On Win16, the normal DOS colors can be used.  See |dos-colors|.

Additionally the system configured colors can also be used.  These are known
by the names Sys_XXX, where XXX is the appropriate system color name, from the
following list (see the Win32 documentation for full descriptions).  Case is
ignored.

Sys_BTNFace		Sys_BTNShadow			Sys_ActiveBorder
Sys_ActiveCaption	Sys_AppWorkspace		Sys_Background
Sys_BTNText		Sys_CaptionText			Sys_GrayText
Sys_Highlight		Sys_HighlightText		Sys_InactiveBorder
Sys_InactiveCaption	Sys_InactiveCaptionText		Sys_Menu
Sys_MenuText		Sys_ScrollBar			Sys_Window
Sys_WindowFrame		Sys_WindowText

Probably the most useful values are
	Sys_Window	    Normal window background
	Sys_WindowText      Normal window text
	Sys_Highlight       Highlighted background
	Sys_HighlightText   Highlighted text

These extra colors are also available:
Gray, Grey, LightYellow, SeaGreen, Orange, Purple, SlateBlue, Violet,


See also |rgb.txt|.

==============================================================================
						*win16-dialogs*
6. Windows dialogs & browsers

The Win16 GUI can use familiar Windows components for some operations, as well
as the traditional interface shared with the console version.


6.1 Dialogs

The dialogs displayed by the "confirm" family (i.e. the 'confirm' option,
|:confirm| command and |confirm()| function) are GUI-based rather than the
console-based ones used by other versions.  There is no option to change this.


6.2 File Browsers

When prepending ":browse" before file editing commands, a file requester is
used to allow you to select an existing file.  See |:browse|.


==============================================================================
7. Various						*win16-various*

							*win16-printing*
The "File/Print" menu uses Notepad to print the current buffer.  This is a bit
clumsy, but it's portable.  If you want something else, you can define your
own print command.  For example, you could look for the 16-bit version of
PrintFile.  See $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim for how it works by default.

Using this should also work: >
	:w >>prn

Vim supports a number of standard MS Windows features.  Some of these are
detailed elsewhere: see |'mouse'|, |win32-hidden-menus|.
Also see |:simalt|

							*win16-drag-n-drop*
You can drag and drop one or more files into the vim window, where they will
be opened as normal.  If you hold down Shift while doing this, Vim changes to
the (first) dropped file's directory.  If you hold Ctrl, Vim will always split
a new window for the file.  Otherwise it's only done if the current buffer has
been changed.
You can also drop a directory's icon, but rather than open all files in the
directory (which wouldn't usually be what you want) Vim instead changes to
that directory and begins a new file.
If Vim happens to be editing a command line, the names of the dropped files
and directories will be inserted at the cursor.  This allows you to use these
names with any Ex command.

							*win16-truetype*
It is recommended that you use a raster font and not a TrueType
fixed-pitch font.  E.g. use Courier, not Courier New.  This is not just
to use less resources but because there are subtle bugs in the
handling of fixed-pitch TrueType in Win3.1x.  In particular, when you move
a block cursor over a pipe character '|', the cursor is drawn in the wrong
size and bits get left behind.  This is a bug in the Win3.1x GDI, it doesn't
happen if you run the exe under 95/NT.

{Vi does not have a Windows GUI}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI					*gui-w32-start*

The Win32 GUI version of Vim will always start the GUI, no matter how you
start it or what it's called.

The GUI will always run in the Windows subsystem.  Mostly shells automatically
return with a command prompt after starting gvim.  If not, you should use the
"start" command: >
	start gvim [options] file ..

Note: All fonts (bold, italic) must be of the same size!!!  If you don't do
this, text will disappear or mess up the display.  Vim does not check the font
sizes.  It's the size in screen pixels that must be the same.  Note that some
fonts that have the same point size don't have the same pixel size!
Additionally, the positioning of the fonts must be the same (ascent and
descent).

The Win32 GUI has an extra menu item:  "Edit/Select Font".  It brings up the
standard Windows font selector.

Setting the menu height doesn't work for the Win32 GUI.

							*gui-win32-maximized*
If you want Vim to start with a maximized window, add this command to your
vimrc or gvimrc file: >
	au GUIEnter * simalt ~x
<
								*gui-w32s*
There is a specific version of gvim.exe that runs under the Win32s subsystem
of Windows 3.1 or 3.11.  See |win32s|.


Using Vim as a plugin					*gui-w32-windowid*

When gvim starts up normally, it creates its own top level window.  If you
pass Vim the command-line option |--windowid| with a decimal or hexadecimal
value, Vim will create a window that is a child of the window with the given
ID.  This enables Vim to act as a plugin in another application.  This really
is a programmer's interface, and is of no use without a supporting application
to spawn Vim correctly.

==============================================================================
2. Vim as default editor				*vim-default-editor*

To set Vim as the default editor for a file type:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Choose View/Options -> File Types
3. Select the path to gvim for every file type that you want to use it for.
   (you can also use three spaces in the file type field, for files without an
   extension).
   In the "open" action, use: >
	gvim "%1"
<  The quotes are required for using file names with embedded spaces.
   You can also use this: >
	gvim "%L"
<  This should avoid short (8.3 character) file names in some situations.  But
   I'm not sure if this works everywhere.

When you open a file in Vim by double clicking it, Vim changes to that
file's directory.

If you want Vim to start full-screen, use this for the Open action: >
	gvim -c "simalt ~x" "%1"

Another method, which also works when you put Vim in another directory (e.g.,
when you have got a new version):
1. select a file you want to use Vim with
2. <Shift-F10>
3. select "Open With..." menu entry
4. click "Other..."
5. browse to the (new) location of Vim and click "Open"
6. make "Always Use this program..." checked
7. <OK>

						*send-to-menu* *sendto*
You can also install Vim in the "Send To" menu:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to your sendto directory:
   Windows 95: %windir%\sendto (e.g. "c:\windows\sendto")
   Windows NT: %windir%\profiles\%user%\sendto (e.g.
	       "c:\winnt\profiles\mattha\sendto").
3. Right-click in the file pane and select New->Shortcut
4. Follow the shortcut wizard, using the full path to VIM/GVIM.

When you 'send a file to Vim', Vim changes to that file's directory.  Note,
however, that any long directory names will appear in their short (MS-DOS)
form.  This is a limitation of the Windows "Send To" mechanism.

						*notepad*
You could replace notepad.exe with gvim.exe, but that has a few side effects.
Some programs rely on notepad arguments, which are not recognized by Vim.  For
example "notepad -p" is used by some applications to print a file.  It's
better to leave notepad where it is and use another way to start Vim.

						*win32-popup-menu*
A more drastic approach is to install an "Edit with Vim" entry in the popup
menu for the right mouse button.  With this you can edit any file with Vim.

This can co-exist with the file associations mentioned above.  The difference
is that the file associations will make starting Vim the default action.  With
the "Edit with Vim" menu entry you can keep the existing file association for
double clicking on the file, and edit the file with Vim when you want.  For
example, you can associate "*.mak" with your make program.  You can execute
the makefile by double clicking it and use the "Edit with Vim" entry to edit
the makefile.

You can select any files and right-click to see a menu option called "Edit
with gvim".  Choosing this menu option will invoke gvim with the file you have
selected.  If you select multiple files, you will find two gvim-related menu
options:
"Edit with multiple gvims"  -- one gvim for each file in the selection
"Edit with single gvim"     -- one gvim for all the files in the selection
And if there already is a gvim running:
"Edit with existing gvim"   -- edit the file with the running gvim

The "edit with existing Vim" entries can be disabled by adding an entry in the
registry under HKLM\Software\Vim\Gvim, named DisableEditWithExisting, and with
any value.
						*install-registry*
You can add the "Edit with Vim" menu entry in an easy way by using the
"install.exe" program.  It will add several registry entries for you.

You can also do this by hand.  This is complicated!  Use the install.exe if
you can.

1. Start the registry editor with "regedit".
2. Add these keys:
   key		value name		    value ~
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}

		path			    {path}\gvim.exe
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\vim 5.6
		DisplayName		    Vim 5.6: Edit with Vim popup menu entry
		UninstallString		    {path}\uninstal.exe

   Replace {path} with the path that leads to the executable.
   Don't type {default}, this is the value for the key itself.

To remove "Edit with Vim" from the popup menu, just remove the registry
entries mentioned above.  The "uninstal.exe" program can do this for you.  You
can also use the entry in the Windows standard "Add/Remove Programs" list.

If you notice that this entry overrules other file type associations, set
those associations again by hand (using Windows Explorer, see above).  This
only seems to happen on some Windows NT versions (Windows bug?).  Procedure:
1. Find the name of the file type.  This can be done by starting the registry
   editor, and searching for the extension in \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
2. In a Windows Explorer, use View/Options/File Types.  Search for the file
   type in the list and click "Edit".  In the actions list, you can select on
   to be used as the default (normally the "open" action) and click on the
   "Set Default" button.


Vim in the "Open With..." context menu			*win32-open-with-menu*

If you use the Vim install program you have the choice to add Vim to the "Open
With..." menu.  This means you can use Vim to edit many files.  Not every file
(for unclear reasons...), thus the "Edit with Vim" menu entry is still useful.

One reason to add this is to be able to edit HTML files directly from Internet
Explorer.  To enable this use the "Tools" menu, "Internet Options..." entry.
In the dialog select the "Programs" tab and select Vim in the "HTML editor"
choice.  If it's not there than installing didn't work properly.

Doing this manually can be done with this script:

----------------------------------------------------------
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit\command]
@="c:\\vim\\vim62\\gvim.exe \"%1\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.htm\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

----------------------------------------------------------

Change the "c:\\vim\\vim62" bit to where gvim.exe is actually located.

To uninstall this run the Vim uninstall program or manually delete the
registry entries with "regedit".

==============================================================================
3. Using the clipboard					*gui-clipboard*

Windows has a clipboard, where you can copy text to, and paste text from.  Vim
supports this in several ways.  For other systems see |gui-selections|.

The "* register reflects the contents of the clipboard.  |quotestar|

When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
register is the same.  Thus you can yank to and paste from the clipboard
without prepending "* to commands.

The 'a' flag in 'guioptions' is not included by default.  This means that text
is only put on the clipboard when an operation is performed on it.  Just
Visually selecting text doesn't put it on the clipboard.  When the 'a' flag is
included, the text is copied to the clipboard even when it is not operated
upon.

							*mswin.vim*
To use the standard MS-Windows way of CTRL-X, CTRL-C and CTRL-V, use the
$VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim script.  You could add this line to your _vimrc file: >
	source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

Since CTRL-C is used to copy the text to the clipboard, it can't be used to
cancel an operation.  Use CTRL-Break for that.

CTRL-Z is used for undo.  This means you can't suspend Vim with this key, use
|:suspend| instead (if it's supported at all).

						*CTRL-V-alternative* *CTRL-Q*
Since CTRL-V is used to paste, you can't use it to start a blockwise Visual
selection.  You can use CTRL-Q instead.  You can also use CTRL-Q in Insert
mode and Command-line mode to get the old meaning of CTRL-V.  But CTRL-Q
doesn't work for terminals when it's used for control flow.

NOTE: The clipboard support still has a number of bugs.  See |todo|.

==============================================================================
4. Shell Commands					*gui-shell-win32*

Vim uses another window for external commands, to make it possible to run any
command.  The external command gets its own environment for running, just like
it was started from a DOS prompt.

							*win32-vimrun*
Executing an external command is done indirectly by the "vimrun" command.  The
"vimrun.exe" must be in the path for this to work.  Or it must be in the same
directory as the Vim executable.  If "vimrun" cannot be found, the command is
executed directly, but then the DOS window closes immediately after the
external command has finished.
WARNING: If you close this window with the "X" button, and confirm the
question if you really want to kill the application, Vim may be killed too!
(This does not apply to commands run asynchronously with ":!start".)

In Windows 95, the window in which the commands are executed is always 25x80
characters, to be as DOS compatible as possible (this matters!).  The default
system font is used.  On NT, the window will be the default you have set up for
"Console" in Control Panel.  On Win32s, the properties of the DOS box are
determined by _default.pif in the windows directory.

							*msdos-mode*
If you get a dialog that says "This program is set to run in MS-DOS mode..."
when you run an external program, you can solve this by changing the
properties of the associated shortcut:
- Use a Windows Explorer to find the command.com that is used.  It can be
  c:\command.com, c:\dos\command.com, c:\windows\command.com, etc.
- With the right mouse button, select properties of this command.com.
- In the Program tab select "Advanced".
- Unselect "MS-DOS mode".
- Click "OK" twice.

							*win32-!start*
Normally, Vim waits for a command to complete before continuing (this makes
sense for most shell commands which produce output for Vim to use).  If you
want Vim to start a program and return immediately, you can use the following
syntax on W95 & NT: >
	:!start [/min] {command}
The optional "/min" causes the window to be minimized.

On Win32s, you will have to go to another window instead.  Don't forget that
you must tell Windows 3.1x to keep executing a DOS command in the background
while you switch back to Vim.

==============================================================================
5. Special colors					*win32-colors*

On Win32, the normal DOS colors can be used.  See |dos-colors|.

Additionally the system configured colors can also be used.  These are known
by the names Sys_XXX, where XXX is the appropriate system color name, from the
following list (see the Win32 documentation for full descriptions).  Case is
ignored.  Note: On Win32s not all of these colors are supported.

Sys_3DDKShadow		Sys_3DFace			Sys_BTNFace
Sys_3DHilight		Sys_3DHighlight			Sys_BTNHilight
Sys_BTNHighlight	Sys_3DLight			Sys_3DShadow
Sys_BTNShadow		Sys_ActiveBorder		Sys_ActiveCaption
Sys_AppWorkspace	Sys_Background			Sys_Desktop
Sys_BTNText		Sys_CaptionText			Sys_GrayText
Sys_Highlight		Sys_HighlightText		Sys_InactiveBorder
Sys_InactiveCaption	Sys_InactiveCaptionText		Sys_InfoBK
Sys_InfoText		Sys_Menu			Sys_MenuText
Sys_ScrollBar		Sys_Window			Sys_WindowFrame
Sys_WindowText

Probably the most useful values are
	Sys_Window	    Normal window background
	Sys_WindowText      Normal window text
	Sys_Highlight       Highlighted background
	Sys_HighlightText   Highlighted text

These extra colors are also available:
Gray, Grey, LightYellow, SeaGreen, Orange, Purple, SlateBlue, Violet,

								*rgb.txt*
Additionally, colors defined by a "rgb.txt" file can be used.  This file is
well known from X11.  A few lines from it: >

  255 218 185		   peach puff
  205 133  63		   peru
  255 181 197		   pink

This shows the layout of the file:  First the R, G and B value as a decimal
number, followed by the name of the color.  The four fields are separated by
spaces.

You can get an rgb.txt file from any X11 distribution.  It is located in a
directory like "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/".  For Vim it must be located in the
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  Thus the file can be found with "$VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt".

==============================================================================
						*gui-w32-dialogs* *dialog*
6. Windows dialogs & browsers

The Win32 GUI can use familiar Windows components for some operations, as well
as the traditional interface shared with the console version.


6.1 Dialogs

The dialogs displayed by the "confirm" family (i.e. the 'confirm' option,
|:confirm| command and |confirm()| function) are GUI-based rather than the
console-based ones used by other versions.  The 'c' flag in 'guioptions'
changes this.


6.2 File Browsers

When prepending ":browse" before file editing commands, a file requester is
used to allow you to select an existing file.  See |:browse|.


6.3 Tearoff Menus

The Win32 GUI emulates Motif's tear-off menus.  At the top of each menu you
will see a small graphic "rip here" sign.  Selecting it will cause a floating
window to be created with the same menu entries on it.  The floating menu can
then be accessed just as if it was the original (including sub-menus), but
without having to go to the menu bar each time.
This is most useful if you find yourself using a command buried in a sub-menu
over and over again.
The tearoff menus can be positioned where you like, and always stay just above
the Main Vim window.  You can get rid of them by closing them as usual; they
also of course close when you exit Vim.

							*:tearoff* *:te*
:te[aroff] {name}	Tear-off the menu {name}.  The menu named must have at
			least one subentry, but need not appear on the
			menu-bar (see |win32-hidden-menus|).

Example: >
	:tearoff File
will make the "File" menu (if there is one) appear as a tearoff menu. >

	:amenu ]Toolbar.Make	:make<CR>
	:tearoff ]Toolbar
This creates a floating menu that doesn't exist on the main menu-bar.

Note that a menu that starts with ']' will not be displayed.

==============================================================================
7. Command line arguments				*gui-w32-cmdargs*

Analysis of a command line into parameters is not standardised in MS Windows.
Gvim has to provide logic to analyse a command line.  This logic is likely to
be different from the default logic provided by a compilation system used to
build vim.  The differences relate to unusual double quote (") usage.
The arguments "C:\My Music\freude.txt" and "+/Sch\"iller" are handled in the
same way.  The argument "+/Sch""iller" may be handled different by gvim and
vim, depending what it was compiled with.

The rules are:
      a) A parameter is a sequence of graphic characters.
      b) Parameters are separated by white space.
      c) A parameter can be enclosed in double quotes to include white space.
      d) A sequence of zero or more backslashes (\) and a double quote (")
	is special.  The effective number of backslashes is halved, rounded
	down.  An even number of backslashes reverses the acceptability of
	spaces and tabs, an odd number of backslashes produces a literal
	double quote.

So:
	"	is a special double quote
	\"	is a literal double quote
	\\"	is a literal backslash and a special double quote
	\\\"	is a literal backslash and a literal double quote
	\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a special double quote
	\\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a literal double quote
	etc.

Example: >
	gvim "C:\My Music\freude" +"set ignorecase" +/"\"foo\\" +\"bar\\\"

opens "C:\My Music\freude" and executes the line mode commands: >
	set ignorecase; /"foo\ and /bar\"

==============================================================================
8. Various						*gui-w32-various*

							*gui-w32-printing*
The "File/Print" menu prints the text with syntax highlighting, see
|:hardcopy|.  If you just want to print the raw text and have a default
printer installed this should also work: >
	:w >>prn

Vim supports a number of standard MS Windows features.  Some of these are
detailed elsewhere: see |'mouse'|, |win32-hidden-menus|.

							*drag-n-drop-win32*
You can drag and drop one or more files into the Vim window, where they will
be opened as normal.  See |drag-n-drop|.

							*:simalt* *:si*
:sim[alt] {key}		simulate pressing {key} while holding Alt pressed.
			{not in Vi} {only for Win32 versions}

Normally, Vim takes control of all Alt-<Key> combinations, to increase the
number of possible mappings.  This clashes with the standard use of Alt as the
key for accessing menus.
The quick way of getting standard behavior is to set the 'winaltkeys' option
to "yes".  This however prevents you from mapping Alt keys at all.
Another way is to set 'winaltkeys' to "menu".  Menu shortcut keys are then
handled by windows, other ALT keys can be mapped.  This doesn't allow a
dependency on the current state though.
To get round this, the :simalt command allows Vim (when 'winaltkeys' is not
"yes") to fake a Windows-style Alt keypress.  You can use this to map Alt key
combinations (or anything else for that matter) to produce standard Windows
actions.  Here are some examples: >

	:map <M-f> :simalt f<CR>
This makes Alt-F pop down the 'File' menu (with the stock Menu.vim) by
simulating the keystrokes Alt, F. >
	:map <M-Space> :simalt ~<CR>
This maps Alt-Space to pop down the system menu for the Vim window.  Note that
~ is used by simalt to represent the <Space> character. >
	:map <C-n> :simalt ~n<CR>
Maps Control-N to produce the keys Alt-Space followed by N.  This minimizes the
Vim window via the system menu.

Note that the key changes depending on the language you are using.

						*intellimouse-wheel-problems*
When using the Intellimouse mouse wheel causes Vim to stop accepting input, go
to:
	ControlPanel - Mouse - Wheel - UniversalScrolling - Exceptions

And add gvim to the list of applications.  This problem only appears to happen
with the Intellimouse driver 2.2 and when "Universal Scrolling" is turned on.


XPM support						*w32-xpm-support*

Gvim can be build on MS-Windows with support for XPM files.  |+xpm_w32|
See the Make_mvc.mak file for instructions, search for XPM.

To try out if XPM support works do this: >
	:help
	:exe 'sign define vimxpm icon=' . $VIMRUNTIME . '\\vim16x16.xpm'
	:exe 'sign place 1 line=1 name=vimxpm file=' . expand('%:p')

Last change: 2014 Mar 08


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Vim's Graphical User Interface				*gui-x11* *GUI-X11*
							*Athena* *Motif*
1. Starting the X11 GUI		|gui-x11-start|
2. GUI Resources		|gui-resources|
3. Shell Commands		|gui-pty|
4. Various			|gui-x11-various|
5. GTK version			|gui-gtk|
6. GNOME version		|gui-gnome|
7. KDE version			|gui-kde|
8. Compiling			|gui-x11-compiling|
9. X11 selection mechanism	|x11-selection|

Other relevant documentation:
|gui.txt|	For generic items of the GUI.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the X11 GUI					*gui-x11-start* *E665*

Then you can run the GUI version of Vim in either of these ways:
    gvim [options] [files...]
    vim -g [options] [files...]

So if you call the executable "gvim", or make "gvim" a link to the executable,
then the GUI version will automatically be used.  Additional characters may be
added after "gvim", for example "gvim-5".

You may also start up the GUI from within the terminal version by using one of
these commands:
	:gui [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]			*:gu* *:gui*
	:gvim [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]			*:gv* *:gvim*
The "-f" option runs Vim in the foreground.
The "-b" option runs Vim in the background (this is the default).
Also see |++opt| and |+cmd|.

							*gui-fork*
When the GUI is started, it does a fork() and exits the current process.
When gvim was started from a shell this makes the shell accept further
commands.  If you don't want this (e.g. when using gvim for a mail program
that waits for gvim to exit), start gvim with "gvim -f", "vim -gf" or use
":gui -f".  Don't use "vim -fg", because "-fg" specifies the foreground
color.

When using "gvim -f" and then ":gui", Vim will run in the foreground.  The
"-f" argument will be remembered.  To force running Vim in the background use
":gui -b".

"gvim --nofork" does the same as "gvim -f".
								*E851* *E852*
When starting the GUI fails Vim will try to continue running in the terminal.

If you want the GUI to run in the foreground always, include the 'f'
flag in 'guioptions'.  |-f|.

==============================================================================
2. GUI Resources			*gui-resources* *.Xdefaults*

If using the Motif or Athena version of the GUI (not for the KDE, GTK+ or Win32
version), a number of X resources are available.  You should use Vim's class
"Vim" when setting these.  They are as follows:

    Resource name	Meaning		~

    reverseVideo	Boolean: should reverse video be used?
    background		Color of background.
    foreground		Color of normal text.
    scrollBackground	Color of trough portion of scrollbars.
    scrollForeground	Color of slider and arrow portions of scrollbars.
    menuBackground	Color of menu backgrounds.
    menuForeground	Color of menu foregrounds.
    tooltipForeground	Color of tooltip and balloon foreground.
    tooltipBackground	Color of tooltip and balloon background.

    font		Name of font used for normal text.
    boldFont		Name of font used for bold text.
    italicFont		Name of font used for italic text.
    boldItalicFont	Name of font used for bold, italic text.
    menuFont		Name of font used for the menus, used when compiled
			without the |+xfontset| feature
    menuFontSet		Name of fontset used for the menus, used when compiled
			with the |+xfontset| feature
    tooltipFont		Name of the font used for the tooltip and balloons.
			When compiled with the |+xfontset| feature this is a
			fontset name.

    geometry		Initial geometry to use for gvim's window (default
			is same size as terminal that started it).
    scrollbarWidth	Thickness of scrollbars.
    borderWidth		Thickness of border around text area.
    menuHeight		Height of the menu bar (only for Athena).

A special font for italic, bold, and italic-bold text will only be used if
the user has specified one via a resource.  No attempt is made to guess what
fonts should be used for these based on the normal text font.

Note that the colors can also be set with the ":highlight" command, using the
"Normal", "Menu", "Tooltip", and "Scrollbar" groups.  Example: >
	:highlight Menu guibg=lightblue
	:highlight Tooltip guibg=yellow
	:highlight Scrollbar guibg=lightblue guifg=blue
	:highlight Normal guibg=grey90
<
							*font-sizes*
Note: All fonts (except for the menu and tooltip) must be of the same size!!!
If you don't do this, text will disappear or mess up the display.  Vim does
not check the font sizes.  It's the size in screen pixels that must be the
same.  Note that some fonts that have the same point size don't have the same
pixel size!  Additionally, the positioning of the fonts must be the same
(ascent and descent).  You can check this with "xlsfonts -l {fontname}".

If any of these things are also set with Vim commands, e.g. with
":set guifont=Screen15", then this will override the X resources (currently
'guifont' is the only option that is supported).

Here is an example of what you might put in your ~/.Xdefaults file: >

	Vim*useSchemes:			all
	Vim*sgiMode:			true
	Vim*useEnhancedFSB:		true
	Vim.foreground:			Black
	Vim.background:			Wheat
	Vim*fontList:			7x13

The first three of these are standard resources on Silicon Graphics machines
which make Motif applications look even better, highly recommended!

The "Vim*fontList" is to set the menu font for Motif.  Example: >
	Vim*menuBar*fontList:	     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
With Athena: >
	Vim*menuBar*SmeBSB*font:     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
	Vim*menuBar*MenuButton*font: -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

NOTE: A more portable, and indeed more correct, way to specify the menu font
in either Motif or Athena is through the resource: >
	Vim.menuFont:	     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Or, when compiled with the |+xfontset| feature: >
	Vim.menuFontSet:     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Don't use "Vim*geometry" in the defaults.  This will break the menus.  Use
"Vim.geometry" instead.

If you get an error message "Cannot allocate colormap entry for "gray60",
try adding this to your Vim resources (change the colors to your liking): >

	Vim*scrollBackground:		Black
	Vim*scrollForeground:		Blue

The resources can also be set with arguments to Vim:

    argument		meaning	~
							*-gui*
   -display {display}	Run vim on {display}		*-display*
   -iconic		Start vim iconified		*-iconic*
   -background {color}	Use {color} for the background	*-background*
   -bg {color}		idem				*-bg*
   -foreground {color}	Use {color} for normal text	*-foreground*
   -fg {color}		idem				*-fg*
   -ul {color}		idem				*-ul*
   -font {font}		Use {font} for normal text	*-font*
   -fn {font}		idem				*-fn*
   -boldfont {font}	Use {font} for bold text	*-boldfont*
   -italicfont {font}	Use {font} for italic text	*-italicfont*
   -menufont {font}	Use {font} for menu items	*-menufont*
   -menufontset {fontset} Use {fontset} for menu items	*-menufontset*
   -mf {font}		idem				*-mf*
   -geometry {geom}	Use {geom} for initial geometry	*-geometry*
   -geom {geom}		idem, see |-geometry-example|	*-geom*
   -borderwidth {width}	Use a border width of {width}	*-borderwidth*
   -bw {width}		idem				*-bw*
							*-scrollbarwidth*
   -scrollbarwidth {width}	Use a scrollbar width of {width}
   -sw {width}		idem				*-sw*
   -menuheight {height}	Use a menu bar height of {height} *-menuheight*
   -mh {height}		idem				*-mh*
			NOTE: On Motif the value is ignored, the menu height
			is computed to fit the menus.
   -reverse		Use reverse video		*-reverse*
   -rv			idem				*-rv*
   +reverse		Don't use reverse video		*-+reverse*
   +rv			idem				*-+rv*
   -xrm {resource}	Set the specified resource	*-xrm*

Note about reverse video: Vim checks that the result is actually a light text
on a dark background.  The reason is that some X11 versions swap the colors,
and some don't.  These two examples will both give yellow text on a blue
background:
    gvim -fg Yellow -bg Blue -reverse
    gvim -bg Yellow -fg Blue -reverse

							*-geometry-example*
An example for the geometry argument: >
	gvim -geometry 80x63+8+100
This creates a window with 80 columns and 63 lines at position 8 pixels from
the left and 100 pixels from the top of the screen.

==============================================================================
3. Shell Commands					*gui-pty*

WARNING: Executing an external command from the GUI will not always work.
"normal" commands like "ls", "grep" and "make" mostly work fine.  Commands
that require an intelligent terminal like "less" and "ispell" won't work.
Some may even hang and need to be killed from another terminal.  So be
careful!

There are two ways to do the I/O with a shell command: Pipes and a pseudo-tty.
The default is to use a pseudo-tty.  This should work best on most systems.

Unfortunately, the implementation of the pseudo-tty is different on every Unix
system.  And some systems require root permission.  To avoid running into
problems with a pseudo-tty when you least expect it, test it when not editing
a file.  Be prepared to "kill" the started command or Vim.  Commands like
":r !cat" may hang!

If using a pseudo-tty does not work for you, reset the 'guipty' option: >

	:set noguipty

Using a pipe should work on any Unix system, but there are disadvantages:
- Some shell commands will notice that a pipe is being used and behave
  differently.  E.g., ":!ls" will list the files in one column.
- The ":sh" command won't show a prompt, although it will sort of work.
- When using ":make" it's not possible to interrupt with a CTRL-C.

Typeahead while the external command is running is often lost.  This happens
both with a pipe and a pseudo-tty.  This is a known problem, but it seems it
can't be fixed (or at least, it's very difficult).

							*gui-pty-erase*
When your erase character is wrong for an external command, you should fix
this in your "~/.cshrc" file, or whatever file your shell uses for
initializations.  For example, when you want to use backspace to delete
characters, but hitting backspaces produces "^H" instead, try adding this to
your "~/.cshrc": >
	stty erase ^H
The ^H is a real CTRL-H, type it as CTRL-V CTRL-H.

==============================================================================
4. Various						*gui-x11-various*

							*gui-x11-printing*
The "File/Print" menu simply sends the current buffer to "lpr".  No options or
whatever.  If you want something else, you can define your own print command.
For example: >

  :10amenu File.Print :w !lpr -Php3
  :10vmenu File.Print :w !lpr -Php3
<
							*X11-icon*
Vim uses a black&white icon by default when compiled with Motif or Athena.  A
colored Vim icon is included as $VIMRUNTIME/vim32x32.xpm.  For GTK+, this is
the builtin icon used.  Unfortunately, how you should install it depends on
your window manager.  When you use this, remove the 'i' flag from
'guioptions', to remove the black&white icon: >
  :set guioptions-=i

If you use one of the fvwm* family of window managers simply add this line to
your .fvwm2rc configuration file: >

  Style "vim"		Icon vim32x32.xpm

Make sure the icon file's location is consistent with the window manager's
ImagePath statement.  Either modify the ImagePath from within your .fvwm2rc or
drop the icon into one the pre-defined directories: >

  ImagePath /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps

Note: older versions of fvwm use "IconPath" instead of "ImagePath".

For CDE "dtwm" (a derivative of Motif) add this line in the .Xdefaults: >
   Dtwm*Vim*iconImage: /usr/local/share/vim/vim32x32.xpm

For "mwm" (Motif window manager) the line would be: >
   Mwm*Vim*iconImage: /usr/local/share/vim/vim32x32.xpm

Mouse Pointers Available in X11				*X11_mouse_shapes*

By using the |'mouseshape'| option, the mouse pointer can be automatically
changed whenever Vim enters one of its various modes (e.g., Insert or
Command).  Currently, the available pointers are:

	arrow			an arrow pointing northwest
	beam			a I-like vertical bar
	size			an arrow pointing up and down
	busy			a wristwatch
	blank			an invisible pointer
	crosshair		a thin "+" sign
	hand1			a dark hand pointing northeast
	hand2			a light hand pointing northwest
	pencil			a pencil pointing southeast
	question		question_arrow
	right_arrow		an arrow pointing northeast
	up_arrow		an arrow pointing upwards

Additionally, any of the mouse pointers that are built into X11 may be
used by specifying an integer from the X11/cursorfont.h include file.

If a name is used that exists on other systems, but not in X11, the default
"arrow" pointer is used.

==============================================================================
5. GTK version						*gui-gtk* *GTK+* *GTK*

The GTK version of the GUI works a little bit different.

GTK does _not_ use the traditional X resource settings.  Thus items in your
~/.Xdefaults or app-defaults files are not used.
Many of the traditional X command line arguments are not supported.  (e.g.,
stuff like -bg, -fg, etc).  The ones that are supported are:

    command line argument   resource name	meaning ~
    -fn  or  -font	    .font		font name for the text
    -geom  or  -geometry    .geometry		size of the gvim window
    -rv  or  -reverse	    *reverseVideo	white text on black background
    -display					display to be used
    -fg -foreground {color}			foreground color
    -bg -background {color}			background color

To set the font, see |'guifont'|.  For GTK, there's also a menu option that
does this.

Additionally, there are these command line arguments, which are handled by GTK
internally.  Look in the GTK documentation for how they are used:
	--sync
	--gdk-debug
	--gdk-no-debug
	--no-xshm	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--xim-preedit	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--xim-status	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--gtk-debug
	--gtk-no-debug
	--g-fatal-warnings
	--gtk-module
	--display	(GTK+ counterpart of -display; works the same way.)
	--screen	(The screen number; for GTK+ 2.2 multihead support.)

These arguments are ignored when the |+netbeans_intg| feature is used:
	-xrm
	-mf

As for colors, Vim's color settings (for syntax highlighting) is still
done the traditional Vim way.  See |:highlight| for more help.

If you want to set the colors of remaining gui components (e.g., the
menubar, scrollbar, whatever), those are GTK specific settings and you
need to set those up in some sort of gtkrc file.  You'll have to refer
to the GTK documentation, however little there is, on how to do this.
See http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-Resource-Files.html
for more information.

						*gtk-tooltip-colors*
Example, which sets the tooltip colors to black on light-yellow: >

	style "tooltips"
	{
		bg[NORMAL] = "#ffffcc"
		fg[NORMAL] = "#000000"
	}

	widget "gtk-tooltips*"		style "tooltips"

Write this in the file ~/.gtkrc and it will be used by GTK+.  For GTK+ 2
you might have to use the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 instead, depending on your
distribution.

Using Vim as a GTK+ plugin				*gui-gtk-socketid*

When the GTK+ version of Vim starts up normally, it creates its own top level
window (technically, a 'GtkWindow').  GTK+ provides an embedding facility with
its GtkSocket and GtkPlug widgets.  If one GTK+ application creates a
GtkSocket widget in one of its windows, an entirely different GTK+ application
may embed itself into the first application by creating a top-level GtkPlug
widget using the socket's ID.

If you pass Vim the command-line option '--socketid' with a decimal or
hexadecimal value, Vim will create a GtkPlug widget using that value instead
of the normal GtkWindow.  This enables Vim to act as a GTK+ plugin.

This really is a programmer's interface, and is of no use without a supporting
application to spawn the Vim correctly.  For more details on GTK+ sockets, see
http://www.gtk.org/api/

Note that this feature requires the latest GTK version.  GTK 1.2.10 still has
a small problem.  The socket feature has not yet been tested with GTK+ 2 --
feel free to volunteer.

==============================================================================
6. GNOME version				*gui-gnome* *Gnome* *GNOME*

The GNOME GUI works just like the GTK+ version.  See |GTK+| above for how it
works.  It looks a bit different though, and implements one important feature
that's not available in the plain GTK+ GUI:  Interaction with the session
manager. |gui-gnome-session|

These are the different looks:
- Uses GNOME dialogs (GNOME 1 only).  The GNOME 2 GUI uses the same nice
  dialogs as the GTK+ 2 version.
- Uses the GNOME dock, so that the toolbar and menubar can be moved to
  different locations other than the top (e.g., the toolbar can be placed on
  the left, right, top, or bottom).  The placement of the menubar and
  toolbar is only saved in the GNOME 2 version.
- That means the menubar and toolbar handles are back!  Yeah!  And the
  resizing grid still works too.

GNOME is compiled with if it was found by configure and the
--enable-gnome-check argument was used.


GNOME session support			*gui-gnome-session* *gnome-session*

On logout, Vim shows the well-known exit confirmation dialog if any buffers
are modified.  Clicking [Cancel] will stop the logout process.  Otherwise the
current session is stored to disk by using the |:mksession| command, and
restored the next time you log in.

The GNOME session support should also work with the KDE session manager.
If you are experiencing any problems please report them as bugs.

Note: The automatic session save works entirely transparent, in order to
avoid conflicts with your own session files, scripts and autocommands.  That
means in detail:
- The session file is stored to a separate directory (usually $HOME/.gnome2).
- 'sessionoptions' is ignored, and a hardcoded set of appropriate flags is
  used instead: >
	blank,curdir,folds,globals,help,options,tabpages,winsize
- The internal variable |v:this_session| is not changed when storing the
  session.  Also, it is restored to its old value when logging in again.

The position and size of the GUI window is not saved by Vim since doing so
is the window manager's job.  But if compiled with GTK+ 2 support, Vim helps
the WM to identify the window by restoring the window role (using the |--role|
command line argument).

==============================================================================
7. KDE version					*gui-kde* *kde* *KDE* *KVim*
							*gui-x11-kde*
There is no KDE version of Vim.  There has been some work on a port using the
Qt toolkit, but it never worked properly and it has been abandoned.  Work
continues on Yzis: https://github.com/chrizel/Yzis.

==============================================================================
8. Compiling						*gui-x11-compiling*

If using X11, Vim's Makefile will by default first try to find the necessary
GTK+ files on your system.  If the GTK+ files cannot be found, then the Motif
files will be searched for.  Finally, if this fails, the Athena files will be
searched for.  If all three fail, the GUI will be disabled.

For GTK+, Vim's configuration process requires that GTK+ be properly
installed.  That is, the shell script 'gtk-config' must be in your PATH, and
you can already successful compile, build, and execute a GTK+ program.  The
reason for this is that the compiler flags (CFLAGS) and link flags (LDFLAGS)
are obtained through the 'gtk-config' shell script.

If you want to build with GTK+ 2 support pass the --enable-gtk2-check argument
to ./configure.  Optionally, support for GNOME 2 will be compiled if the
--enable-gnome-check option is also given.

Otherwise, if you are using Motif or Athena, when you have the Motif or Athena
files in a directory where configure doesn't look, edit the Makefile to enter
the names of the directories.  Search for "GUI_INC_LOC" for an example to set
the Motif directories, "CONF_OPT_X" for Athena.

							*gui-x11-gtk*
At the time of this writing, GTK+ version 1.0.6 and 1.2 are outdated.  It
is suggested that you use GTK 2.  The GTK 1 support will most likely be
dropped soon.

For the GTK+ 2 GUI, using the latest release of the GTK+ 2.0 or GTK+ 2.2
series is recommended.

Lastly, although GTK+ has supposedly been ported to the Win32 platform, this
has not been tested with Vim and is also unsupported.  Also, it's unlikely to
even compile since GTK+ GUI uses parts of the generic X11 code.  This might
change in distant future; particularly because getting rid of the X11 centric
code parts is also required for GTK+ framebuffer support.

							*gui-x11-motif*
For Motif, you need at least Motif version 1.2 and/or X11R5.  Motif 2.0 and
X11R6 are OK.  Motif 1.1 and X11R4 might work, no guarantee (there may be a
few problems, but you might make it compile and run with a bit of work, please
send me the patches if you do).  The newest releases of LessTif have been
reported to work fine too.

							*gui-x11-athena*
The Athena version uses the Xaw widget set by default.  If you have the 3D
version, you might want to link with Xaw3d instead.  This will make the
menus look a bit better.  Edit the Makefile and look for "XAW_LIB".  The
scrollbars will remain the same, because Vim has its own, which are already
3D (in fact, they look more like Motif).

							*gui-x11-neXtaw*
The neXtaw version is mostly like Athena, but uses different widgets.

							*gui-x11-misc*
In general, do not try to mix files from different GTK+, Motif, Athena and X11
versions.  This will cause problems.  For example, using header files for
X11R5 with a library for X11R6 probably doesn't work (although the linking
won't give an error message, Vim will crash later).

==============================================================================
9. X11 selection mechanism				*x11-selection*

If using X11, in either the GUI or an xterm with an X11-aware Vim, then Vim
provides varied access to the X11 selection and clipboard.  These are accessed
by using the two selection registers "* and "+.

X11 provides two basic types of global store, selections and cut-buffers,
which differ in one important aspect: selections are "owned" by an
application, and disappear when that application (e.g., Vim) exits, thus
losing the data, whereas cut-buffers, are stored within the X-server itself
and remain until written over or the X-server exits (e.g., upon logging out).

The contents of selections are held by the originating application (e.g., upon
a copy), and only passed on to another application when that other application
asks for them (e.g., upon a paste).

The contents of cut-buffers are immediately written to, and are then
accessible directly from the X-server, without contacting the originating
application.

							*quoteplus* *quote+*
There are three documented X selections: PRIMARY (which is expected to
represent the current visual selection - as in Vim's Visual mode), SECONDARY
(which is ill-defined) and CLIPBOARD (which is expected to be used for
cut, copy and paste operations).

Of these three, Vim uses PRIMARY when reading and writing the "* register
(hence when the X11 selections are available, Vim sets a default value for
|'clipboard'| of "autoselect"), and CLIPBOARD when reading and writing the "+
register.  Vim does not access the SECONDARY selection.

Examples: (assuming the default option values)
- Select an URL in Visual mode in Vim.  Go to your browser and click the
  middle mouse button in the URL text field.  The selected text will be
  inserted (hopefully!).  Note: in Firefox you can set the
  middlemouse.contentLoadURL preference to true in about:config, then the
  selected URL will be used when pressing middle mouse button in most places
  in the window.
- Select some text in your browser by dragging with the mouse.  Go to Vim and
  press the middle mouse button: The selected text is inserted.
- Select some text in Vim and do "+y.  Go to your browser, select some text in
  a textfield by dragging with the mouse.  Now use the right mouse button and
  select "Paste" from the popup menu.  The selected text is overwritten by the
  text from Vim.
Note that the text in the "+ register remains available when making a Visual
selection, which makes other text available in the "* register.  That allows
overwriting selected text.
							*x11-cut-buffer*
There are, by default, 8 cut-buffers: CUT_BUFFER0 to CUT_BUFFER7.  Vim only
uses CUT_BUFFER0, which is the one that xterm uses by default.

Whenever Vim is about to become unavailable (either via exiting or becoming
suspended), and thus unable to respond to another application's selection
request, it writes the contents of any owned selection to CUT_BUFFER0.  If the
"+ CLIPBOARD selection is owned by Vim, then this is written in preference,
otherwise if the "* PRIMARY selection is owned by Vim, then that is written.

Similarly, when Vim tries to paste from "* or "+ (either explicitly, or, in
the case of the "* register, when the middle mouse button is clicked), if the
requested X selection is empty or unavailable, Vim reverts to reading the
current value of the CUT_BUFFER0.

Note that when text is copied to CUT_BUFFER0 in this way, the type of
selection (character, line or block) is always lost, even if it is a Vim which
later pastes it.

Xterm, by default, always writes visible selections to both PRIMARY and
CUT_BUFFER0.  When it pastes, it uses PRIMARY if this is available, or else
falls back upon CUT_BUFFER0.  For this reason, when cutting and pasting
between Vim and an xterm, you should use the "* register.  Xterm doesn't use
CLIPBOARD, thus the "+ doesn't work with xterm.

Most newer applications will provide their current selection via PRIMARY ("*)
and use CLIPBOARD ("+) for cut/copy/paste operations.  You thus have access to
both by choosing to use either of the "* or "+ registers.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Chi-Deok Hwang and Sung-Hyun Nam

NOTE: The |+hangul_input| feature is scheduled to be removed.  If you want to
keep it, please send a message to the Vim user maillist.


Introduction					*hangul*
------------
It is to input hangul, the Korean language, with VIM GUI version.
If you have a XIM program, you can use another |+xim| feature.
Basically, it is for anybody who has no XIM program.

Compile
-------
Next is a basic option.  You can add any other configure option. >

   ./configure --with-x --enable-multibyte --enable-fontset --enable-hangulinput

And you should check feature.h.  If |+hangul_input| feature is enabled
by configure, you can select more options such as keyboard type, 2 bulsik
or 3 bulsik.  You can find keywords like next in there. >

	#define HANGUL_DEFAULT_KEYBOARD 2
	#define ESC_CHG_TO_ENG_MODE
	/* #define X_LOCALE */
	/* #define SLOW_XSERVER */

Environment variables
---------------------
You should set LANG variable to Korean locale such as ko or ko_KR.euc.
If you set LC_ALL variable, it should be set to Korean locale also.

VIM resource
------------
You should add nexts to your global vimrc ($HOME/.vimrc). >

	:set fileencoding=korea

Keyboard
--------
You can change keyboard type (2 bulsik or 3 bulsik) using VIM_KEYBOARD
or HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE environment variables.  For sh, just do (2 bulsik): >

    export VIM_KEYBOARD="2"
or >
    export HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE="2"

If both are set, VIM_KEYBOARD has higher priority.

Hangul Fonts
------------
You can set text font using $HOME/.Xdefaults or in your gvimrc file.
But to use Hangul, you should set 'guifontset' in your vimrc.

$HOME/.Xdefaults: >
    Vim.font: english_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Athena
    *international: True
    Vim*fontSet: english_font,hangul_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Motif
    *international: True
    Vim*fontList: english_font;hangul_font:

$HOME/.gvimrc: >
    set guifontset=english_font,hangul_font

attention! the , (comma) or ; (semicolon)

And there should be no ':set guifont'.  If it exists, then Gvim ignores
':set guifontset'.  It means VIM runs without fontset supporting.
So, you can see only English.  Hangul does not be correctly displayed.

After 'fontset' feature is enabled, VIM does not allow using 'font'.
For example, if you use >
   :set guifontset=eng_font,your_font
in your .gvimrc, then you should do for syntax >
   :hi Comment guifg=Cyan font=another_eng_font,another_your_font
If you just do >
   :hi Comment font=another_eng_font
then you can see a GOOD error message.  Be careful!

hangul_font width should be twice than english_font width.

Unsupported Feature
-------------------
Johab font not yet supported.  And I don't have any plan.
If you really want to use johab font, you can use the
hanguldraw.c in gau package.

Hanja input not yet supported.  And I don't have any plan.
If you really want to input hanja, just use VIM with hanterm.

Last change: 2007 Jun 14


	   VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Ron Aaron (and Avner Lottem)


Hebrew Language support (options & mapping) for Vim		*hebrew*

The supporting 'rightleft' functionality was originally created by Avner
Lottem. <alottem at gmail dot com>  Ron Aaron <ron at ronware dot org> is
currently helping support these features.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

All this is only available when the |+rightleft| feature was enabled at
compile time.


Introduction
------------
Hebrew-specific options are 'hkmap', 'hkmapp' 'keymap'=hebrew and 'aleph'.
Hebrew-useful options are 'delcombine', 'allowrevins', 'revins', 'rightleft'
and 'rightleftcmd'.

The 'rightleft' mode reverses the display order, so characters are displayed
from right to left instead of the usual left to right.  This is useful
primarily when editing Hebrew or other Middle-Eastern languages.
See |rileft.txt| for further details.

Details
--------------
+  Options:
   +  'rightleft' ('rl') sets window orientation to right-to-left.  This means
      that the logical text 'ABC' will be displayed as 'CBA', and will start
      drawing at the right edge of the window, not the left edge.
   +  'hkmap' ('hk') sets keyboard mapping to Hebrew, in insert/replace modes.
   +  'aleph' ('al'), numeric, holds the decimal code of Aleph, for keyboard
      mapping.
   +  'hkmapp' ('hkp') sets keyboard mapping to 'phonetic hebrew'

   NOTE: these three ('hkmap', 'hkmapp' and 'aleph') are obsolete.  You should
	 use ":set keymap=hebrewp" instead.

   +  'delcombine' ('deco'), boolean, if editing UTF-8 encoded Hebrew, allows
      one to remove the niqud or te`amim by pressing 'x' on a character (with
      associated niqud).

   +  'rightleftcmd' ('rlc') makes the command-prompt for searches show up on
      the right side.  It only takes effect if the window is 'rightleft'.

+  Encoding:
   +  Under Unix, ISO 8859-8 encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 224-250).
   +  Under MS DOS, PC encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 128-154).
      These are defaults, that can be overridden using the 'aleph' option.
   +  You should prefer using UTF8, as it supports the combining-characters
      ('deco' does nothing if UTF8 encoding is not active).

+  Vim arguments:
   +  'vim -H file' starts editing a Hebrew file, i.e. 'rightleft' and 'hkmap'
      are set.

+  Keyboard:
   +  The 'allowrevins' option enables the CTRL-_ command in Insert mode and
      in Command-line mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles 'revins' and 'hkmap' as follows:

      When in rightleft window, 'revins' and 'nohkmap' are toggled, since
      English will likely be inserted in this case.

      When in norightleft window, 'revins' 'hkmap' are toggled, since Hebrew
      will likely be inserted in this case.

      CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping (see Bugs below).
      This setting is independent of 'hkmap' option, which only applies to
      insert/replace mode.

      Note: On some keyboards, CTRL-_ is mapped to CTRL-?.

   +  Keyboard mapping while 'hkmap' is set (standard Israeli keyboard):

	q w e r t y u i o p
	/ '        

	 a s d f g h j k l ; '
	           ,

	  z x c v b n m , . /
	           .

      This is also the keymap when 'keymap=hebrew' is set.  The advantage of
      'keymap' is that it works properly when using UTF8, e.g. it inserts the
      correct characters; 'hkmap' does not.  The 'keymap' keyboard can also
      insert niqud and te`amim.  To see what those mappings are, look at the
      keymap file 'hebrew.vim' etc.


Typing backwards

If the 'revins' (reverse insert) option is set, inserting happens backwards.
This can be used to type Hebrew.  When inserting characters the cursor is not
moved and the text moves rightwards.  A <BS> deletes the character under the
cursor.  CTRL-W and CTRL-U also work in the opposite direction.  <BS>, CTRL-W
and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of insert or end of line, no matter how
the 'backspace' option is set.

There is no reverse replace mode (yet).

If the 'showmode' option is set, "-- REVERSE INSERT --" will be shown in the
status line when reverse Insert mode is active.

When the 'allowrevins' option is set, reverse Insert mode can be also entered
via CTRL-_, which has some extra functionality: First, keyboard mapping is
changed according to the window orientation -- if in a left-to-right window,
'revins' is used to enter Hebrew text, so the keyboard changes to Hebrew
('hkmap' is set); if in a right-to-left window, 'revins' is used to enter
English text, so the keyboard changes to English ('hkmap' is reset).  Second,
when exiting 'revins' via CTRL-_, the cursor moves to the end of the typed
text (if possible).


Pasting when in a rightleft window
----------------------------------
When cutting text with the mouse and pasting it in a rightleft window
the text will be reversed, because the characters come from the cut buffer
from the left to the right, while inserted in the file from the right to
the left.   In order to avoid it, toggle 'revins' (by typing CTRL-? or CTRL-_)
before pasting.


Hebrew characters and the 'isprint' variable
--------------------------------------------
Sometimes Hebrew character codes are in the non-printable range defined by
the 'isprint' variable.  For example in the Linux console, the Hebrew font
encoding starts from 128, while the default 'isprint' variable is @,161-255.
The result is that all Hebrew characters are displayed as ~x.  To solve this
problem, set isprint=@,128-255.

Now that you've jumped here with CTRL-] or a double mouse click, you can use
CTRL-T, CTRL-O, g<RightMouse>, or <C-RightMouse> to go back to where you were.

Note that tags are within | characters, but when highlighting is enabled these
characters are hidden.  That makes it easier to read a command.

Anyway, you can use CTRL-] on any word, also when it is not within |, and Vim
will try to find help for it.  Especially for options in single quotes, e.g.
'compatible'.

Help on help files					*helphelp*

1. Help commands		|online-help|
2. Translated help files	|help-translated|
3. Writing help files		|help-writing|

==============================================================================
1. Help commands					*online-help*

			*help* *<Help>* *:h* *:help* *<F1>* *i_<F1>* *i_<Help>*
<Help>		or
:h[elp]			Open a window and display the help file in read-only
			mode.  If there is a help window open already, use
			that one.  Otherwise, if the current window uses the
			full width of the screen or is at least 80 characters
			wide, the help window will appear just above the
			current window.  Otherwise the new window is put at
			the very top.
			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the main help file is available in several languages.
			{not in Vi}

						*{subject}* *E149* *E661*
:h[elp] {subject}	Like ":help", additionally jump to the tag {subject}.
			{subject} can include wildcards like "*", "?" and
			"[a-z]":
			   :help z?	jump to help for any "z" command
			   :help z.	jump to the help for "z."
			If there is no full match for the pattern, or there
			are several matches, the "best" match will be used.
			A sophisticated algorithm is used to decide which
			match is better than another one.  These items are
			considered in the computation:
			- A match with same case is much better than a match
			  with different case.
			- A match that starts after a non-alphanumeric
			  character is better than a match in the middle of a
			  word.
			- A match at or near the beginning of the tag is
			  better than a match further on.
			- The more alphanumeric characters match, the better.
			- The shorter the length of the match, the better.

			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the {subject} is available in several languages.
			To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab",
			where "ab" is the two-letter language code.  See
			|help-translated|.

			Note that the longer the {subject} you give, the less
			matches will be found.  You can get an idea how this
			all works by using commandline completion (type CTRL-D
			after ":help subject" |c_CTRL-D|).
			If there are several matches, you can have them listed
			by hitting CTRL-D.  Example: >
				:help cont<Ctrl-D>

<			Instead of typing ":help CTRL-V" to search for help
			for CTRL-V you can type: >
				:help ^V
<			This also works together with other characters, for
			example to find help for CTRL-V in Insert mode: >
				:help i^V
<
			To use a regexp |pattern|, first do ":help" and then
			use ":tag {pattern}" in the help window.  The
			":tnext" command can then be used to jump to other
			matches, "tselect" to list matches and choose one. >
				:help index| :tse z.

<			When there is no argument you will see matches for
			"help", to avoid listing all possible matches (that
			would be very slow).
			The number of matches displayed is limited to 300.

			This command can be followed by '|' and another
			command, but you don't need to escape the '|' inside a
			help command.  So these both work: >
				:help |
				:help k| only
<			Note that a space before the '|' is seen as part of
			the ":help" argument.
			You can also use <LF> or <CR> to separate the help
			command from a following command.  You need to type
			CTRL-V first to insert the <LF> or <CR>.  Example: >
				:help so<C-V><CR>only
<			{not in Vi}

:h[elp]! [subject]	Like ":help", but in non-English help files prefer to
			find a tag in a file with the same language as the
			current file.  See |help-translated|.

						 	*:helpc* *:helpclose*
:helpc[lose]            Close one help window, if there is one.

							*:helpg* *:helpgrep*
:helpg[rep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Search all help text files and make a list of lines
			in which {pattern} matches.  Jumps to the first match.
			The optional [@xx] specifies that only matches in the
			"xx" language are to be found.
			You can navigate through the matches with the
			|quickfix| commands, e.g., |:cnext| to jump to the
			next one.  Or use |:cwindow| to get the list of
			matches in the quickfix window.
			{pattern} is used as a Vim regexp |pattern|.
			'ignorecase' is not used, add "\c" to ignore case.
			Example for case sensitive search: >
				:helpgrep Uganda
<			Example for case ignoring search: >
				:helpgrep uganda\c
<			Example for searching in French help: >
				:helpgrep backspace@fr
<			The pattern does not support line breaks, it must
			match within one line.  You can use |:grep| instead,
			but then you need to get the list of help files in a
			complicated way.
			Cannot be followed by another command, everything is
			used as part of the pattern.  But you can use
			|:execute| when needed.
			Compressed help files will not be searched (Fedora
			compresses the help files).
			{not in Vi}

							*:lh* *:lhelpgrep*
:lh[elpgrep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Same as ":helpgrep", except the location list is used
			instead of the quickfix list.  If the help window is
			already opened, then the location list for that window
			is used.  Otherwise, a new help window is opened and
			the location list for that window is set.  The
			location list for the current window is not changed.

							*:exu* *:exusage*
:exu[sage]		Show help on Ex commands.  Added to simulate the Nvi
			command. {not in Vi}

							*:viu* *:viusage*
:viu[sage]		Show help on Normal mode commands.  Added to simulate
			the Nvi command. {not in Vi}

When no argument is given to |:help| the file given with the 'helpfile' option
will be opened.  Otherwise the specified tag is searched for in all "doc/tags"
files in the directories specified in the 'runtimepath' option.

The initial height of the help window can be set with the 'helpheight' option
(default 20).

Jump to specific subjects by using tags.  This can be done in two ways:
- Use the "CTRL-]" command while standing on the name of a command or option.
  This only works when the tag is a keyword.  "<C-Leftmouse>" and
  "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "CTRL-]".
- use the ":ta {subject}" command.  This also works with non-keyword
  characters.

Use CTRL-T or CTRL-O to jump back.
Use ":q" to close the help window.

If there are several matches for an item you are looking for, this is how you
can jump to each one of them:
1. Open a help window
2. Use the ":tag" command with a slash prepended to the tag.  E.g.: >
	:tag /min
3. Use ":tnext" to jump to the next matching tag.

It is possible to add help files for plugins and other items.  You don't need
to change the distributed help files for that.  See |add-local-help|.

To write a local help file, see |write-local-help|.

Note that the title lines from the local help files are automagically added to
the "LOCAL ADDITIONS" section in the "help.txt" help file |local-additions|.
This is done when viewing the file in Vim, the file itself is not changed.  It
is done by going through all help files and obtaining the first line of each
file.  The files in $VIMRUNTIME/doc are skipped.

							*help-xterm-window*
If you want to have the help in another xterm window, you could use this
command: >
	:!xterm -e vim +help &
<

			*:helpfind* *:helpf*
:helpf[ind]		Like |:help|, but use a dialog to enter the argument.
			Only for backwards compatibility.  It now executes the

==============================================================================
2. Translated help files				*help-translated*

It is possible to add translated help files, next to the original English help
files.  Vim will search for all help in "doc" directories in 'runtimepath'.
This is only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang| feature.

At this moment translations are available for:
	Chinese  - multiple authors
	French   - translated by David Blanchet
	Italian  - translated by Antonio Colombo
	Japanese - multiple authors
	Polish   - translated by Mikolaj Machowski
	Russian  - translated by Vassily Ragosin
See the Vim website to find them: http://www.vim.org/translations.php

A set of translated help files consists of these files:

	help.abx
	howto.abx
	...
	tags-ab

"ab" is the two-letter language code.  Thus for Italian the names are:

	help.itx
	howto.itx
	...
	tags-it

The 'helplang' option can be set to the preferred language(s).  The default is
set according to the environment.  Vim will first try to find a matching tag
in the preferred language(s).  English is used when it cannot be found.

To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab" to a tag, where "ab" is the
two-letter language code.  Example: >
	:he user-manual@it
	:he user-manual@en
The first one finds the Italian user manual, even when 'helplang' is empty.
The second one finds the English user manual, even when 'helplang' is set to
"it".

When using command-line completion for the ":help" command, the "@en"
extension is only shown when a tag exists for multiple languages.  When the
tag only exists for English "@en" is omitted.

When using |CTRL-]| or ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will try to
find the tag in the same language.  If not found then 'helplang' will be used
to select a language.

Help files must use latin1 or utf-8 encoding.  Vim assumes the encoding is
utf-8 when finding non-ASCII characters in the first line.  Thus you must
translate the header with "For Vim version".

The same encoding must be used for the help files of one language in one
directory.  You can use a different encoding for different languages and use
a different encoding for help files of the same language but in a different
directory.

Hints for translators:
- Do not translate the tags.  This makes it possible to use 'helplang' to
  specify the preferred language.  You may add new tags in your language.
- When you do not translate a part of a file, add tags to the English version,
  using the "tag@en" notation.
- Make a package with all the files and the tags file available for download.
  Users can drop it in one of the "doc" directories and start use it.
  Report this to Bram, so that he can add a link on www.vim.org.
- Use the |:helptags| command to generate the tags files.  It will find all
  languages in the specified directory.

==============================================================================
3. Writing help files					*help-writing*

For ease of use, a Vim help file for a plugin should follow the format of the
standard Vim help files.  If you are writing a new help file it's best to copy
one of the existing files and use it as a template.

The first line in a help file should have the following format:

*helpfile_name.txt*	For Vim version 7.3	Last change: 2010 June 4

The first field is a link to the help file name.  The second field describes
the applicable Vim version.  The last field specifies the last modification
date of the file.  Each field is separated by a tab.

At the bottom of the help file, place a Vim modeline to set the 'textwidth'
and 'tabstop' options and the 'filetype' to 'help'.  Never set a global option
in such a modeline, that can have consequences undesired by whoever reads that
help.


TAGS

To define a help tag, place the name between asterisks (*tag-name*).  The
tag-name should be different from all the Vim help tag names and ideally
should begin with the name of the Vim plugin.  The tag name is usually right
aligned on a line.

When referring to an existing help tag and to create a hot-link, place the
name between two bars (|) eg. |help-writing|.

When referring to a Vim option in the help file, place the option name between
two single quotes, eg. 'statusline'


HIGHLIGHTING

To define a column heading, use a tilde character at the end of the line.
This will highlight the column heading in a different color.  E.g.

Column heading~

To separate sections in a help file, place a series of '=' characters in a
line starting from the first column.  The section separator line is highlighted
differently.

To quote a block of ex-commands verbatim, place a greater than (>) character
at the end of the line before the block and a less than (<) character as the
first non-blank on a line following the block.  Any line starting in column 1
also implicitly stops the block of ex-commands before it.  E.g. >
    function Example_Func()
	echo "Example"
    endfunction
<

The following are highlighted differently in a Vim help file:
  - a special key name expressed either in <> notation as in <PageDown>, or
    as a Ctrl character as in CTRL-X
  - anything between {braces}, e.g. {lhs} and {rhs}

The word "Note", "Notes" and similar automagically receive distinctive
highlighting.  So do these:
	*Todo	something to do
	*Error	something wrong

You can find the details in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/help.vim

							*cscope* *Cscope*
This document explains how to use Vim's cscope interface.

Cscope is a tool like ctags, but think of it as ctags on steroids since it
does a lot more than what ctags provides.  In Vim, jumping to a result from
a cscope query is just like jumping to any tag; it is saved on the tag stack
so that with the right keyboard mappings, you can jump back and forth between
functions as you normally would with |tags|.

2. Cscope related commands	|cscope-commands|
3. Cscope options		|cscope-options|
4. How to use cscope in Vim	|cscope-howtouse|
5. Limitations			|cscope-limitations|
6. Suggested usage		|cscope-suggestions|
7. Availability & Information	|cscope-info|

This is currently for Unix and Win32 only.
{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Cscope introduction					*cscope-intro*

The following text is taken from a version of the cscope man page:

				    -----

  Cscope is an interactive screen-oriented tool that helps you:

       Learn how a C program works without endless flipping through a thick
       listing.

       Locate the section of code to change to fix a bug without having to
       learn the entire program.

       Examine the effect of a proposed change such as adding a value to an
       enum variable.

       Verify that a change has been made in all source files such as adding
       an argument to an existing function.

       Rename a global variable in all source files.

       Change a constant to a preprocessor symbol in selected lines of files.

  It is designed to answer questions like:
       Where is this symbol used?
       Where is it defined?
       Where did this variable get its value?
       What is this global symbol's definition?
       Where is this function in the source files?
       What functions call this function?
       What functions are called by this function?
       Where does the message "out of space" come from?
       Where is this source file in the directory structure?
       What files include this header file?

  Cscope answers these questions from a symbol database that it builds the
  first time it is used on the source files.  On a subsequent call, cscope
  rebuilds the database only if a source file has changed or the list of
  source files is different.  When the database is rebuilt the data for the
  unchanged files is copied from the old database, which makes rebuilding
  much faster than the initial build.

				    -----

When cscope is normally invoked, you will get a full-screen selection
screen allowing you to make a query for one of the above questions.
However, once a match is found to your query and you have entered your
text editor to edit the source file containing match, you cannot simply
jump from tag to tag as you normally would with vi's Ctrl-] or :tag
command.

Vim's cscope interface is done by invoking cscope with its line-oriented
interface, and then parsing the output returned from a query.  The end
result is that cscope query results become just like regular tags, so
you can jump to them just like you do with normal tags (Ctrl-] or :tag)
and then go back by popping off the tagstack with Ctrl-T.  (Please note
however, that you don't actually jump to a cscope tag simply by doing
Ctrl-] or :tag without remapping these commands or setting an option.
See the remaining sections on how the cscope interface works and for
suggested use.)


==============================================================================
2. Cscope related commands				*cscope-commands*

		*:cscope* *:cs* *:scs* *:scscope* *E259* *E262* *E561* *E560*
All cscope commands are accessed through suboptions to the main cscope
command ":cscope".  The shortest abbreviation is ":cs".  The ":scscope"
command does the same and also splits the window (short: "scs").

The available subcommands are:

			*E563* *E564* *E566* *E568* *E569* *E622* *E623*
			*E625* *E626* *E609*
    add   : Add a new cscope database/connection.

	USAGE	:cs add {file|dir} [pre-path] [flags]

	    [pre-path] is the pathname used with the -P command to cscope.

	    [flags] are any additional flags you want to pass to cscope.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope add /usr/local/cdb/cscope.out
	    :cscope add /projects/vim/cscope.out /usr/local/vim
	    :cscope add cscope.out /usr/local/vim -C
<
				      *cscope-find* *cs-find* *E567*
    find  : Query cscope.  All cscope query options are available
	    except option #5 ("Change this grep pattern").

	USAGE	:cs find {querytype} {name}

	    {querytype} corresponds to the actual cscope line
	    interface numbers as well as default nvi commands:

		0 or s: Find this C symbol
		1 or g: Find this definition
		2 or d: Find functions called by this function
		3 or c: Find functions calling this function
		4 or t: Find this text string
		6 or e: Find this egrep pattern
		7 or f: Find this file
		8 or i: Find files #including this file

	For all types, except 4 and 6, leading white space for {name} is
	removed.  For 4 and 6 there is exactly one space between {querytype}
	and {name}.  Further white space is included in {name}.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope find c vim_free
	    :cscope find 3  vim_free
<
	    These two examples perform the same query: functions calling
	    "vim_free". >

	    :cscope find t initOnce
	    :cscope find t  initOnce
<
	    The first one searches for the text "initOnce", the second one for
	    " initOnce". >

	    :cscope find 0 DEFAULT_TERM
<
	    Executing this example on the source code for Vim 5.1 produces the
	    following output:

	    Cscope tag: DEFAULT_TERM
	       #   line  filename / context / line
	       1   1009  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<GLOBAL>>

	      10   1042  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<GLOBAL>>
			 #define DEFAULT_TERM (char_u *)"mac-ansi"
	      11   1335  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<set_termname>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      12   1459  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<set_termname>>
			 if (STRCMP(term, DEFAULT_TERM))
	      13   1826  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<termcapinit>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      14   1833  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<termcapinit>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      15   3635  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<update_tcap>>
			 p = find_builtin_term(DEFAULT_TERM);
	    Enter nr of choice (<CR> to abort):

	    The output shows several pieces of information:
	    1. The tag number (there are 15 in this example).
	    2. The line number where the tag occurs.
	    3. The filename where the tag occurs.
	    4. The context of the tag (e.g., global, or the function name).
	    5. The line from the file itself.

    help  : Show a brief synopsis.

	    USAGE   :cs help

							*E261*
    kill  : Kill a cscope connection (or kill all cscope connections).

	    USAGE   :cs kill {num|partial_name}

	    To kill a cscope connection, the connection number or a partial
	    name must be specified.  The partial name is simply any part of
	    the pathname of the cscope database.  Kill a cscope connection
	    using the partial name with caution!

	    If the specified connection number is -1, then _ALL_ cscope
	    connections will be killed.

    reset : Reinit all cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs reset

    show  : Show cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs show

							*:lcscope* *:lcs*
This command is same as the ":cscope" command, except when the
'cscopequickfix' option is set, the location list for the current window is
used instead of the quickfix list to show the cscope results.

							*:cstag* *E257* *E562*
If you use cscope as well as ctags, |:cstag| allows you to search one or
the other before making a jump.  For example, you can choose to first
search your cscope database(s) for a match, and if one is not found, then
your tags file(s) will be searched.  The order in which this happens
is determined by the value of |csto|.  See |cscope-options| for more
details.

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of ":cs find g" on the identifier when
searching through the cscope database(s).

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of |:tjump| on the identifier when searching
through your tags file(s).


==============================================================================
3. Cscope options					*cscope-options*

Use the |:set| command to set all cscope options.  Ideally, you would do
this in one of your startup files (e.g., .vimrc).  Some cscope related
variables are only valid within |.vimrc|.  Setting them after vim has
started will have no effect!

							*cscopeprg* *csprg*
'cscopeprg' specifies the command to execute cscope.  The default is
"cscope".  For example: >
	:set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
<
					    *cscopequickfix* *csqf* *E469*
{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix| feature}
'cscopequickfix' specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope
results.  This is a list of comma-separated values. Each item consists of
|cscope-find| command (s, g, d, c, t, e, f or i) and flag (+, - or 0).
'+' indicates that results must be appended to quickfix window,
'-' implies previous results clearance, '0' or command absence - don't use
quickfix.  Search is performed from start until first command occurrence.
The default value is "" (don't use quickfix anyway).  The following value
seems to be useful: >
	:set cscopequickfix=s-,c-,d-,i-,t-,e-
<
							*cscopetag* *cst*
If 'cscopetag' is set, the commands ":tag" and CTRL-] as well as "vim -t"
will always use |:cstag| instead of the default :tag behavior.  Effectively,
by setting 'cst', you will always search your cscope databases as well as
your tag files.  The default is off.  Examples: >
	:set cst
	:set nocst
<
							*cscoperelative* *csre*
If 'cscoperelative' is set, then in absence of a prefix given to cscope
(prefix is the argument of -P option of cscope), basename of cscope.out
location (usually the project root directory) will be used as the prefix
to construct an absolute path.  The default is off.  Note: This option is
only effective when cscope (cscopeprg) is initialized without a prefix
path (-P).  Examples: >
	:set csre
	:set nocsre
<
							*cscopetagorder* *csto*
The value of 'csto' determines the order in which |:cstag| performs a search.
If 'csto' is set to zero, cscope database(s) are searched first, followed
by tag file(s) if cscope did not return any matches.  If 'csto' is set to
one, tag file(s) are searched before cscope database(s).  The default is zero.
Examples: >
	:set csto=0
	:set csto=1
<
						*cscopeverbose* *csverb*
If 'cscopeverbose' is not set (the default), messages will not be printed
indicating success or failure when adding a cscope database.  Ideally, you
should reset this option in your |.vimrc| before adding any cscope databases,
and after adding them, set it.  From then on, when you add more databases
within Vim, you will get a (hopefully) useful message should the database fail
to be added.  Examples: >
	:set csverb
	:set nocsverb
<
						      *cscopepathcomp* *cspc*
The value of 'cspc' determines how many components of a file's path to
display.  With the default value of zero the entire path will be displayed.
The value one will display only the filename with no path.  Other values
display that many components.  For example: >
	:set cspc=3
will display the last 3 components of the file's path, including the file
name itself.

==============================================================================
4. How to use cscope in Vim				*cscope-howtouse*

The first thing you need to do is to build a cscope database for your
source files.  For the most basic case, simply do "cscope -b".  Please
refer to the cscope man page for more details.

Assuming you have a cscope database, you need to "add" the database to Vim.
This establishes a cscope "connection" and makes it available for Vim to use.
You can do this in your .vimrc file, or you can do it manually after starting
vim.  For example, to add the cscope database "cscope.out", you would do:

	:cs add cscope.out

You can double-check the result of this by executing ":cs show".  This will
produce output which looks like this:

 # pid	  database name			      prepend path
 0 28806  cscope.out			      <none>

Note:
Because of the Microsoft RTL limitations, Win32 version shows 0 instead
of the real pid.

Once a cscope connection is established, you can make queries to cscope and
the results will be printed to you.  Queries are made using the command
":cs find".  For example:

	:cs find g ALIGN_SIZE

This can get a little cumbersome since one ends up doing a significant
amount of typing.  Fortunately, there are ways around this by mapping
shortcut keys.  See |cscope-suggestions| for suggested usage.

If the results return only one match, you will automatically be taken to it.
If there is more than one match, you will be given a selection screen to pick
the match you want to go to.  After you have jumped to the new location,
simply hit Ctrl-T to get back to the previous one.


==============================================================================
5. Limitations						*cscope-limitations*

Cscope support for Vim is only available on systems that support these four
system calls: fork(), pipe(), execl(), waitpid().  This means it is mostly
limited to Unix systems.

Additionally Cscope support works for Win32.  For more information and a
cscope version for Win32 see:

	http://iamphet.nm.ru/cscope/index.html

The DJGPP-built version from http://cscope.sourceforge.net is known to not
work with Vim.

Hard-coded limitation: doing a |:tjump| when |:cstag| searches the tag files
is not configurable (e.g., you can't do a tselect instead).

==============================================================================
6. Suggested usage					*cscope-suggestions*

Put these entries in your .vimrc (adjust the pathname accordingly to your
setup): >

	if has("cscope")
		set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
		set csto=0
		set cst
		set nocsverb
		" add any database in current directory
		if filereadable("cscope.out")
		    cs add cscope.out
		" else add database pointed to by environment
		elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
		    cs add $CSCOPE_DB
		endif
		set csverb
	endif

By setting 'cscopetag', we have effectively replaced all instances of the :tag
command with :cstag.  This includes :tag, Ctrl-], and "vim -t".  In doing
this, the regular tag command not only searches your ctags generated tag
files, but your cscope databases as well.

Some users may want to keep the regular tag behavior and have a different
shortcut to access :cstag.  For example, one could map Ctrl-_  (underscore)
to :cstag with the following command: >

	map <C-_> :cstag <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

A couple of very commonly used cscope queries (using ":cs find") is to
find all functions calling a certain function and to find all occurrences
of a particular C symbol.  To do this, you can use these mappings as an
example: >

	map g<C-]> :cs find 3 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	map g<C-\> :cs find 0 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

These mappings for Ctrl-] (right bracket) and Ctrl-\ (backslash) allow you to
place your cursor over the function name or C symbol and quickly query cscope
for any matches.

Or you may use the following scheme, inspired by Vim/Cscope tutorial from
Cscope Home Page (http://cscope.sourceforge.net/): >

	nmap <C-_>s :cs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>g :cs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>c :cs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>t :cs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>e :cs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>f :cs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>i :cs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-_>d :cs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Using 'CTRL-spacebar' then a search type makes the vim window
	" split horizontally, with search result displayed in
	" the new window.

	nmap <C-Space>s :scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>g :scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>c :scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>t :scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>e :scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>f :scs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>i :scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space>d :scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Hitting CTRL-space *twice* before the search type does a vertical
	" split instead of a horizontal one

	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>s
		\:vert scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>g
		\:vert scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>c
		\:vert scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>t
		\:vert scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>e
		\:vert scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>i
		\:vert scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>d
		\:vert scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

==============================================================================
7. Cscope availability and information			*cscope-info*

If you do not already have cscope (it did not come with your compiler
license or OS distribution), then you can download it for free from:
	http://cscope.sourceforge.net/
This is released by SCO under the BSD license.

If you want a newer version of cscope, you will probably have to buy it.
According to the (old) nvi documentation:

	You can buy version 13.3 source with an unrestricted license
	for $400 from AT&T Software Solutions by calling +1-800-462-8146.

Also you can download cscope 13.x and mlcscope 14.x (multi-lingual cscope
which supports C, C++, Java, lex, yacc, breakpoint listing, Ingres, and SDL)
from World-Wide Exptools Open Source packages page:
	http://www.bell-labs.com/project/wwexptools/packages.html

In Solaris 2.x, if you have the C compiler license, you will also have
cscope.  Both are usually located under /opt/SUNWspro/bin

SGI developers can also get it.  Search for Cscope on this page:
	http://freeware.sgi.com/index-by-alpha.html
	https://toolbox.sgi.com/toolbox/utilities/cscope/
The second one is for those who have a password for the SGI toolbox.

There is source to an older version of a cscope clone (called "cs") available
on the net.  Due to various reasons, this is not supported with Vim.

The cscope interface/support for Vim was originally written by
Andy Kahn <ackahn@netapp.com>.  The original structure (as well as a tiny
bit of code) was adapted from the cscope interface in nvi.  Please report
any problems, suggestions, patches, et al., you have for the usage of
cscope within Vim to him.
							*cscope-win32*
For a cscope version for Win32 see:
	http://code.google.com/p/cscope-win32/

Win32 support was added by Sergey Khorev <sergey.khorev@gmail.com>.  Contact
him if you have Win32-specific issues.

Last change: 2013 Sep 04


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Luis Carvalho


The Lua Interface to Vim				*lua* *Lua*

1. Commands			|lua-commands|
2. The vim module		|lua-vim|
3. List userdata		|lua-list|
4. Dict userdata		|lua-dict|
5. Funcref userdata		|lua-funcref|
6. Buffer userdata		|lua-buffer|
7. Window userdata		|lua-window|
8. The luaeval function		|lua-luaeval|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Lua interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+lua| feature.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*lua-commands*

							*:lua*
:[range]lua {chunk}
			Execute Lua chunk {chunk}.    {not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:lua print("Hello, Vim!")
	:lua local curbuf = vim.buffer() curbuf[7] = "line #7"
<

:[range]lua << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Lua script {script}.  {not in Vi}
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Lua
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like
for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:lua| command is mainly useful for including Lua code
in Vim scripts.

Example:
>
	function! CurrentLineInfo()
	lua << EOF
	local linenr = vim.window().line
	local curline = vim.buffer()[linenr]
	print(string.format("Current line [%d] has %d chars",
		linenr, #curline))
	EOF
	endfunction
<

							*:luado*
:[range]luado {body}	Execute Lua function "function (line, linenr) {body}
			end" for each line in the [range], with the function
			argument being set to the text of each line in turn,
			without a trailing <EOL>, and the current line number.
			If the value returned by the function is a string it
			becomes the text of the line in the current turn. The
			default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".
							{not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:luado return string.format("%s\t%d", line:reverse(), #line)

	:lua require"lpeg"
	:lua -- balanced parenthesis grammar:
	:lua bp = lpeg.P{ "(" * ((1 - lpeg.S"()") + lpeg.V(1))^0 * ")" }
	:luado if bp:match(line) then return "-->\t" .. line end
<

							*:luafile*
:[range]luafile {file}
			Execute Lua script in {file}. {not in Vi}
			The whole argument is used as a single file name.

Examples:
>
	:luafile script.lua
	:luafile %
<

All these commands execute a Lua chunk from either the command line (:lua and
:luado) or a file (:luafile) with the given line [range]. Similarly to the Lua
interpreter, each chunk has its own scope and so only global variables are
shared between command calls. All Lua default libraries are available. In
addition, Lua "print" function has its output redirected to the Vim message
area, with arguments separated by a white space instead of a tab.

Lua uses the "vim" module (see |lua-vim|) to issue commands to Vim
and manage buffers (|lua-buffer|) and windows (|lua-window|). However,
procedures that alter buffer content, open new buffers, and change cursor
position are restricted when the command is executed in the |sandbox|.


==============================================================================
2. The vim module					*lua-vim*

Lua interfaces Vim through the "vim" module. The first and last line of the
input range are stored in "vim.firstline" and "vim.lastline" respectively. The
module also includes routines for buffer, window, and current line queries,
Vim evaluation and command execution, and others.

	vim.list([arg])		Returns an empty list or, if "arg" is a Lua
				table with numeric keys 1, ..., n (a
				"sequence"), returns a list l such that l[i] =
				arg[i] for i = 1, ..., n (see |List|).
				Non-numeric keys are not used to initialize
				the list. See also |lua-eval| for conversion
				rules. Example: >
					:lua t = {math.pi, false, say = 'hi'}
					:echo luaeval('vim.list(t)')
					:" [3.141593, 0], 'say' is ignored
<
	vim.dict([arg])		Returns an empty dictionary or, if "arg" is a
				Lua table, returns a dict d such that d[k] =
				arg[k] for all string keys k in "arg" (see
				|Dictionary|). Number keys are converted to
				strings. Keys that are not strings are not
				used to initialize the dictionary. See also
				|lua-eval| for conversion rules. Example: >
					:lua t = {math.pi, false, say = 'hi'}
					:echo luaeval('vim.dict(t)')
					:" {'say': 'hi'}, numeric keys ignored
<
	vim.funcref({name})	Returns a Funcref to function {name} (see
				|Funcref|). It is equivalent to Vim's
				"function". NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

	vim.buffer([arg])	If "arg" is a number, returns buffer with
				number "arg" in the buffer list or, if "arg"
				is a string, returns buffer whose full or short
				name is "arg". In both cases, returns 'nil'
				(nil value, not string) if the buffer is not
				found. Otherwise, if "toboolean(arg)" is
				'true' returns the first buffer in the buffer
				list or else the current buffer.

	vim.window([arg])	If "arg" is a number, returns window with
				number "arg" or 'nil' (nil value, not string)
				if not found. Otherwise, if "toboolean(arg)"
				is 'true' returns the first window or else the
				current window.

	vim.type({arg})		Returns the type of {arg}. It is equivalent to
				Lua's "type" function, but returns "list",
				"dict", "funcref", "buffer", or "window" if
				{arg} is a list, dictionary, funcref, buffer,
				or window, respectively. Examples: >
					:lua l = vim.list()
					:lua print(type(l), vim.type(l))
					:" userdata list
<
	vim.command({cmd})	Executes the vim (ex-mode) command {cmd}.
				Examples: >
					:lua vim.command"set tw=60"
					:lua vim.command"normal ddp"
<
	vim.eval({expr})	Evaluates expression {expr} (see |expression|),
				converts the result to Lua, and returns it.
				Vim strings and numbers are directly converted
				to Lua strings and numbers respectively. Vim
				lists and dictionaries are converted to Lua
				userdata (see |lua-list| and |lua-dict|).
				Examples: >
					:lua tw = vim.eval"&tw"
					:lua print(vim.eval"{'a': 'one'}".a)
<
	vim.line()		Returns the current line (without the trailing
				<EOL>), a Lua string.

	vim.beep()		Beeps.

	vim.open({fname})	Opens a new buffer for file {fname} and
				returns it. Note that the buffer is not set as
				current.


==============================================================================
3. List userdata					*lua-list*

List userdata represent vim lists, and the interface tries to follow closely
Vim's syntax for lists. Since lists are objects, changes in list references in
Lua are reflected in Vim and vice-versa. A list "l" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "#l" is the number of items in list "l", equivalent to "len(l)"
	    in Vim.
	o "l[k]" returns the k-th item in "l"; "l" is zero-indexed, as in Vim.
	    To modify the k-th item, simply do "l[k] = newitem"; in
	    particular, "l[k] = nil" removes the k-th item from "l".
	o "l()" returns an iterator for "l".

Methods
-------
	o "l:add(item)" appends "item" to the end of "l".
	o "l:insert(item[, pos])" inserts "item" at (optional)
	    position "pos" in the list. The default value for "pos" is 0.

Examples:
>
	:let l = [1, 'item']
	:lua l = vim.eval('l') -- same 'l'
	:lua l:add(vim.list())
	:lua l[0] = math.pi
	:echo l[0] " 3.141593
	:lua l[0] = nil -- remove first item
	:lua l:insert(true, 1)
	:lua print(l, #l, l[0], l[1], l[-1])
	:lua for item in l() do print(item) end
<

==============================================================================
4. Dict userdata					*lua-dict*

Similarly to list userdata, dict userdata represent vim dictionaries; since
dictionaries are also objects, references are kept between Lua and Vim. A dict
"d" has the following properties:

Properties
----------
	o "#d" is the number of items in dict "d", equivalent to "len(d)"
	    in Vim.
	o "d.key" or "d['key']" returns the value at entry "key" in "d".
	    To modify the entry at this key, simply do "d.key = newvalue"; in
	    particular, "d.key = nil" removes the entry from "d".
	o "d()" returns an iterator for "d" and is equivalent to "items(d)" in
	    Vim.

Examples:
>
	:let d = {'n':10}
	:lua d = vim.eval('d') -- same 'd'
	:lua print(d, d.n, #d)
	:let d.self = d
	:lua for k, v in d() do print(d, k, v) end
	:lua d.x = math.pi
	:lua d.self = nil -- remove entry
	:echo d
<

==============================================================================
5. Funcref userdata					*lua-funcref*

Funcref userdata represent funcref variables in Vim. Funcrefs that were
defined with a "dict" attribute need to be obtained as a dictionary key
in order to have "self" properly assigned to the dictionary (see examples
below.) A funcref "f" has the following properties:

Properties
----------
	o "#f" is the name of the function referenced by "f"
	o "f(...)" calls the function referenced by "f" (with arguments)

Examples:
>
	:function I(x)
	:  return a:x
	:  endfunction
	:let R = function('I')
	:lua i1 = vim.funcref('I')
	:lua i2 = vim.eval('R')
	:lua print(#i1, #i2) -- both 'I'
	:lua print(i1, i2, #i2(i1) == #i1(i2))
	:function Mylen() dict
	:  return len(self.data)
	:  endfunction
	:let mydict = {'data': [0, 1, 2, 3]}
	:lua d = vim.eval('mydict'); d.len = vim.funcref('Mylen')
	:echo mydict.len()
	:lua l = d.len -- assign d as 'self'
	:lua print(l())
<

==============================================================================
6. Buffer userdata					*lua-buffer*

Buffer userdata represent vim buffers. A buffer userdata "b" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "b()" sets "b" as the current buffer.
	o "#b" is the number of lines in buffer "b".
	o "b[k]" represents line number k: "b[k] = newline" replaces line k
	    with string "newline" and "b[k] = nil" deletes line k.
	o "b.name" contains the short name of buffer "b" (read-only).
	o "b.fname" contains the full name of buffer "b" (read-only).
	o "b.number" contains the position of buffer "b" in the buffer list
	    (read-only).

Methods
-------
	o "b:insert(newline[, pos])" inserts string "newline" at (optional)
	    position "pos" in the buffer. The default value for "pos" is
	    "#b + 1". If "pos == 0" then "newline" becomes the first line in
	    the buffer.
	o "b:next()" returns the buffer next to "b" in the buffer list.
	o "b:previous()" returns the buffer previous to "b" in the buffer
	    list.
	o "b:isvalid()" returns 'true' (boolean) if buffer "b" corresponds to
	    a "real" (not freed from memory) Vim buffer.

Examples:
>
	:lua b = vim.buffer() -- current buffer
	:lua print(b.name, b.number)
	:lua b[1] = "first line"
	:lua b:insert("FIRST!", 0)
	:lua b[1] = nil -- delete top line
	:lua for i=1,3 do b:insert(math.random()) end
	:3,4lua for i=vim.lastline,vim.firstline,-1 do b[i] = nil end
	:lua vim.open"myfile"() -- open buffer and set it as current

	function! ListBuffers()
	lua << EOF
	local b = vim.buffer(true) -- first buffer in list
	while b ~= nil do
		print(b.number, b.name, #b)
		b = b:next()
	end
	vim.beep()
	EOF
	endfunction
<

==============================================================================
7. Window userdata					*lua-window*

Window objects represent vim windows. A window userdata "w" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "w()" sets "w" as the current window.
	o "w.buffer" contains the buffer of window "w" (read-only).
	o "w.line" represents the cursor line position in window "w".
	o "w.col" represents the cursor column position in window "w".
	o "w.width" represents the width of window "w".
	o "w.height" represents the height of window "w".

Methods
-------
	o "w:next()" returns the window next to "w".
	o "w:previous()" returns the window previous to "w".
	o "w:isvalid()" returns 'true' (boolean) if window "w" corresponds to
	    a "real" (not freed from memory) Vim window.

Examples:
>
	:lua w = vim.window() -- current window
	:lua print(w.buffer.name, w.line, w.col)
	:lua w.width = w.width + math.random(10)
	:lua w.height = 2 * math.random() * w.height
	:lua n,w = 0,vim.window(true) while w~=nil do n,w = n + 1,w:next() end
	:lua print("There are " .. n .. " windows")
<

==============================================================================
8. The luaeval function					*lua-luaeval* *lua-eval*

The (dual) equivalent of "vim.eval" for passing Lua values to Vim is
"luaeval". "luaeval" takes an expression string and an optional argument and
returns the result of the expression. It is semantically equivalent in Lua to:
>
	local chunkheader = "local _A = select(1, ...) return "
	function luaeval (expstr, arg)
	    local chunk = assert(loadstring(chunkheader .. expstr, "luaeval"))
	    return chunk(arg) -- return typval
	end
<
Note that "_A" receives the argument to "luaeval". Lua numbers, strings, and
list, dict, and funcref userdata are converted to their Vim respective types,
while Lua booleans are converted to numbers. An error is thrown if conversion
of any of the remaining Lua types, including userdata other than lists, dicts,
and funcrefs, is attempted.

Examples: >

	:echo luaeval('math.pi')
	:lua a = vim.list():add('newlist')
	:let a = luaeval('a')

The MzScheme Interface to Vim				*mzscheme* *MzScheme*

1. Commands				|mzscheme-commands|
2. Examples				|mzscheme-examples|
3. Threads				|mzscheme-threads|
4. Vim access from MzScheme		|mzscheme-vim|
5. mzeval() Vim function		|mzscheme-mzeval|
6. Using Function references		|mzscheme-funcref|
7. Dynamic loading			|mzscheme-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The MzScheme interface is available only if Vim was compiled with the
|+mzscheme| feature.

Based on the work of Brent Fulgham.
Dynamic loading added by Sergey Khorev

MzScheme and PLT Scheme names have been rebranded as Racket. For more
information please check http://racket-lang.org

Futures and places of Racket version 5.x up to and including 5.3.1 do not
work correctly with processes created by Vim.
The simplest solution is to build Racket on your own with these features
disabled: >
  ./configure --disable-futures --disable-places --prefix=your-install-prefix

To speed up the process, you might also want to use --disable-gracket and
--disable-docs

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*mzscheme-commands*

							*:mzscheme* *:mz*
:[range]mz[scheme] {stmt}
			Execute MzScheme statement {stmt}.  {not in Vi}

:[range]mz[scheme] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute inlined MzScheme script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work if the MzScheme
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

							*:mzfile* *:mzf*
:[range]mzf[ile] {file}	Execute the MzScheme script in {file}.  {not in Vi}

All of these commands do essentially the same thing - they execute a piece of
MzScheme code, with the "current range" set to the given line
range.

In the case of :mzscheme, the code to execute is in the command-line.
In the case of :mzfile, the code to execute is the contents of the given file.

MzScheme interface defines exception exn:vim, derived from exn.
It is raised for various Vim errors.

During compilation, the MzScheme interface will remember the current MzScheme
collection path. If you want to specify additional paths use the
'current-library-collection-paths' parameter. E.g., to cons the user-local
MzScheme collection path: >
    :mz << EOF
    (current-library-collection-paths
	(cons
	    (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir) (version) "collects")
	    (current-library-collection-paths)))
    EOF
<

All functionality is provided through module vimext.

The exn:vim is available without explicit import.

To avoid clashes with MzScheme, consider using prefix when requiring module,
e.g.: >
	:mzscheme (require (prefix vim- vimext))
<
All the examples below assume this naming scheme. 

							*mzscheme-sandbox*
When executed in the |sandbox|, access to some filesystem and Vim interface
procedures is restricted.

==============================================================================
2. Examples						*mzscheme-examples*
>
	:mzscheme (display "Hello")
	:mz (display (string-append "Using MzScheme version " (version)))
	:mzscheme (require (prefix vim- vimext)) ; for MzScheme < 4.x
	:mzscheme (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext)) ; MzScheme 4.x
	:mzscheme (vim-set-buff-line 10 "This is line #10")
<
Inline script usage: >
	function! <SID>SetFirstLine()
	    :mz << EOF
	    (display "!!!")
	    (require (prefix vim- vimext))
	    ; for newer versions (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext))
	    (vim-set-buff-line 1 "This is line #1")
	    (vim-beep)

	if strpart(l:mzversion, 1, 1) < "4"
	    " MzScheme versions < 4.x:
	    :mz (require (prefix vim- vimext))
	else
	    " newer versions:
	    :mz (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext))
	endif
    endfunction

    if has("mzscheme")
	silent call MzRequire()
    endif
<
==============================================================================
3. Threads						*mzscheme-threads*

The MzScheme interface supports threads. They are independent from OS threads,
thus scheduling is required. The option 'mzquantum' determines how often
Vim should poll for available MzScheme threads.
NOTE
Thread scheduling in the console version of Vim is less reliable than in the
GUI version.

==============================================================================
4. Vim access from MzScheme				*mzscheme-vim*

							*mzscheme-vimext*
The 'vimext' module provides access to procedures defined in the MzScheme
interface.

Common
------
    (command {command-string})	    Perform the vim ":Ex" style command.
    (eval {expr-string})	    Evaluate the vim expression into
				    respective MzScheme object: |Lists| are
				    represented as Scheme lists,
				    |Dictionaries| as hash tables,
				    |Funcref|s as functions (see also
				    |mzscheme-funcref|)
				    NOTE the name clashes with MzScheme eval,
				    use module qualifiers to overcome this.
    (range-start)		    Start/End of the range passed with
    (range-end)			    the Scheme command.
    (beep)			    beep
    (get-option {option-name} [buffer-or-window]) Get Vim option value (either
				    local or global, see set-option).
    (set-option {string} [buffer-or-window])
				    Set a Vim option. String must have option
				    setting form (like optname=optval, or
				    optname+=optval, etc.) When called with
				    {buffer} or {window} the local option will
				    be set. The symbol 'global can be passed
				    as {buffer-or-window}. Then |:setglobal|
				    will be used.

Buffers							 *mzscheme-buffer*
-------
    (buff? {object})		    Is object a buffer?
    (buff-valid? {object})	    Is object a valid buffer? (i.e.
				    corresponds to the real Vim buffer)
    (get-buff-line {linenr} [buffer])
				    Get line from a buffer.
    (set-buff-line {linenr} {string} [buffer])
				    Set a line in a buffer. If {string} is #f,
				    the line gets deleted.  The [buffer]
				    argument is optional. If omitted, the
				    current buffer will be used.
    (get-buff-line-list {start} {end} [buffer])
				    Get a list of lines in a buffer. {Start}
				    and {end} are 1-based and inclusive.
    (set-buff-line-list {start} {end} {string-list} [buffer])
				    Set a list of lines in a buffer. If
				    string-list is #f or null, the lines get
				    deleted. If a list is shorter than
				    {end}-{start} the remaining lines will
				    be deleted.
    (get-buff-name [buffer])	    Get a buffer's text name.
    (get-buff-num [buffer])	    Get a buffer's number.
    (get-buff-size [buffer])	    Get buffer line count.
    (insert-buff-line-list {linenr} {string/string-list} [buffer])
				    Insert a list of lines into a buffer after
				    {linenr}. If {linenr} is 0, lines will be
				    inserted at start.
    (curr-buff)			    Get the current buffer. Use other MzScheme
				    interface procedures to change it.
    (buff-count)		    Get count of total buffers in the editor.
    (get-next-buff [buffer])	    Get next buffer.
    (get-prev-buff [buffer])	    Get previous buffer. Return #f when there
				    are no more buffers.
    (open-buff {filename})	    Open a new buffer (for file "name")
    (get-buff-by-name {buffername}) Get a buffer by its filename or #f
					if there is no such buffer.
    (get-buff-by-num {buffernum})   Get a buffer by its number (return #f if
				    there is no buffer with this number).

Windows							    *mzscheme-window*
------
    (win? {object})		    Is object a window?
    (win-valid? {object})	    Is object a valid window (i.e. corresponds
				    to the real Vim window)?
    (curr-win)			    Get the current window.
    (win-count)			    Get count of windows.
    (get-win-num [window])	    Get window number.
    (get-win-by-num {windownum})    Get window by its number.
    (get-win-buffer	[window])   Get the buffer for a given window.
    (get-win-height [window])
    (set-win-height {height} [window])  Get/Set height of window.
    (get-win-width [window])
    (set-win-width {width} [window])Get/Set width of window.
    (get-win-list [buffer])	    Get list of windows for a buffer.
    (get-cursor [window])	    Get cursor position in a window as
				    a pair (linenr . column).
    (set-cursor (line . col) [window])  Set cursor position.

==============================================================================
5. mzeval() Vim function				    *mzscheme-mzeval*

To facilitate bi-directional interface, you can use |mzeval()| function to
evaluate MzScheme expressions and pass their values to VimL.

==============================================================================
6. Using Function references				    *mzscheme-funcref*

MzScheme interface allows use of |Funcref|s so you can call Vim functions
directly from Scheme. For instance: >
    function! MyAdd2(arg)
	return a:arg + 2
    endfunction
    mz (define f2 (vim-eval "function(\"MyAdd2\")"))
    mz (f2 7)
< or : >
    :mz (define indent (vim-eval "function('indent')"))
    " return Vim indent for line 12
    :mz (indent 12)
<

==============================================================================
7. Dynamic loading				    *mzscheme-dynamic* *E815*

On MS-Windows the MzScheme libraries can be loaded dynamically. The |:version|
output then includes |+mzscheme/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the MzScheme DLL files only when needed.
When you don't use the MzScheme interface you don't need them, thus you can
use Vim without these DLL files.

To use the MzScheme interface the MzScheme DLLs must be in your search path.
In a console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The names of the DLLs must match the MzScheme version Vim was compiled with.
For MzScheme version 209 they will be "libmzsch209_000.dll" and
"libmzgc209_000.dll". To know for sure look at the output of the ":version"
command, look for -DDYNAMIC_MZSCH_DLL="something" and
-DDYNAMIC_MZGC_DLL="something" in the "Compilation" info.

The OLE Interface to Vim				*ole-interface*

1. Activation			|ole-activation|
2. Methods			|ole-methods|
3. The "normal" command		|ole-normal|
4. Registration			|ole-registration|
5. MS Visual Studio integration	|MSVisualStudio|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

OLE is only available when compiled with the |+ole| feature.  See
src/if_ole.INSTALL.
An alternative is using the client-server communication |clientserver|.

==============================================================================
1. Activation						*ole-activation*

Vim acts as an OLE automation server, accessible from any automation client,
for example, Visual Basic, Python, or Perl.  The Vim application "name" (its
"ProgID", in OLE terminology) is "Vim.Application".

Hence, in order to start a Vim instance (or connect to an already running
instance), code similar to the following should be used:

[Visual Basic] >
	Dim Vim As Object
	Set Vim = CreateObject("Vim.Application")

[Python] >
	from win32com.client.dynamic import Dispatch
	vim = Dispatch('Vim.Application')

[Perl] >
	use Win32::OLE;
	$vim = new Win32::OLE 'Vim.Application';

[C#] >
        // Add a reference to VIM in your project. 
        // Choose the COM tab.
        // Select "VIM Ole Interface 1.1 Type Library"
	Vim.Vim vimobj = new Vim.Vim();

Vim does not support acting as a "hidden" OLE server, like some other OLE
Automation servers.  When a client starts up an instance of Vim, that instance
is immediately visible.  Simply closing the OLE connection to the Vim instance
is not enough to shut down the Vim instance - it is necessary to explicitly
execute a quit command (for example, :qa!, :wqa).

==============================================================================
2. Methods						*ole-methods*

Vim exposes four methods for use by clients.

							*ole-sendkeys*
SendKeys(keys)		Execute a series of keys.

This method takes a single parameter, which is a string of keystrokes.  These
keystrokes are executed exactly as if they had been types in at the keyboard.
Special keys can be given using their <..> names, as for the right hand side
of a mapping.  Note: Execution of the Ex "normal" command is not supported -
see below |ole-normal|.

Examples (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim.SendKeys "ihello<Esc>"
	Vim.SendKeys "ma1GV4jy`a"

These examples assume that Vim starts in Normal mode.  To force Normal mode,
start the key sequence with CTRL-\ CTRL-N as in >

	Vim.SendKeys "<C-\><C-N>ihello<Esc>"

CTRL-\ CTRL-N returns Vim to Normal mode, when in Insert or Command-line mode.
Note that this doesn't work halfway a Vim command

							*ole-eval*
Eval(expr)		Evaluate an expression.

This method takes a single parameter, which is an expression in Vim's normal
format (see |expression|).  It returns a string, which is the result of
evaluating the expression.  A |List| is turned into a string by joining the
items and inserting line breaks.

Examples (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Line20 = Vim.Eval("getline(20)")
	Twelve = Vim.Eval("6 + 6")		' Note this is a STRING
	Font = Vim.Eval("&guifont")
<
							*ole-setforeground*
SetForeground()		Make the Vim window come to the foreground

This method takes no arguments.  No value is returned.

Example (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim.SetForeground
<

							*ole-gethwnd*
GetHwnd()		Return the handle of the Vim window.

This method takes no arguments.  It returns the hwnd of the main Vimwindow.
You can use this if you are writing something which needs to manipulate the
Vim window, or to track it in the z-order, etc.

Example (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim_Hwnd = Vim.GetHwnd
<

==============================================================================
3. The "normal" command					*ole-normal*

Due to the way Vim processes OLE Automation commands, combined with the method
of implementation of the Ex command :normal, it is not possible to execute the
:normal command via OLE automation.  Any attempt to do so will fail, probably
harmlessly, although possibly in unpredictable ways.

There is currently no practical way to trap this situation, and users must
simply be aware of the limitation.
==============================================================================
4. Registration					*ole-registration* *E243*

Before Vim will act as an OLE server, it must be registered in the system
registry.  In order to do this, Vim should be run with a single parameter of
"-register".
							*-register*  >
	gvim -register

If gvim with OLE support is run and notices that no Vim OLE server has been
registered, it will present a dialog and offers you the choice to register by
clicking "Yes".

In some situations registering is not possible.  This happens when the
registry is not writable.  If you run into this problem you need to run gvim
as "Administrator".

Once vim is registered, the application path is stored in the registry.
Before moving, deleting, or upgrading Vim, the registry entries should be
removed using the "-unregister" switch.
							*-unregister*  >
	gvim -unregister

The OLE mechanism will use the first registered Vim it finds.  If a Vim is
already running, this one will be used.  If you want to have (several) Vim
sessions open that should not react to OLE commands, use the non-OLE version,
and put it in a different directory.  The OLE version should then be put in a
directory that is not in your normal path, so that typing "gvim" will start
the non-OLE version.

							*-silent*
To avoid the message box that pops up to report the result, prepend "-silent":
>
	gvim -silent -register
	gvim -silent -unregister

==============================================================================
5. MS Visual Studio integration			*MSVisualStudio* *VisVim*

The OLE version can be used to run Vim as the editor in Microsoft Visual
Studio.  This is called "VisVim".  It is included in the archive that contains
the OLE version.  The documentation can be found in the runtime directory, the
README_VisVim.txt file.


Using Vim with Visual Studio .Net~

With .Net you no longer really need VisVim, since .Net studio has support for
external editors.  Follow these directions:

In .Net Studio choose from the menu Tools->External Tools...
Add
     Title     - Vim
     Command   - c:\vim\vim63\gvim.exe
     Arguments - --servername VS_NET --remote-silent "+call cursor($(CurLine), $(CurCol))" $(ItemPath)
     Init Dir  - Empty

Now, when you open a file in .Net, you can choose from the .Net menu:
Tools->Vim

That will open the file in Vim.
You can then add this external command as an icon and place it anywhere you
like.  You might also be able to set this as your default editor.

If you refine this further, please post back to the Vim maillist so we have a
record of it.

--servername VS_NET
This will create a new instance of vim called VS_NET.  So if you open multiple
files from VS, they will use the same instance of Vim.  This allows you to
have multiple copies of Vim running, but you can control which one has VS
files in it.

--remote-silent "+call cursor(10, 27)"
	      - Places the cursor on line 10 column 27
In Vim >
   :h --remote-silent for mor details

Last change: 2013 Oct 05


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Sven Verdoolaege
					 and Matt Gerassimof

Perl and Vim				*perl* *Perl*

1. Editing Perl files			|perl-editing|
2. Compiling VIM with Perl interface	|perl-compiling|
3. Using the Perl interface		|perl-using|
4. Dynamic loading			|perl-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Perl interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+perl| feature.

==============================================================================
1. Editing Perl files					*perl-editing*

Vim syntax highlighting supports Perl and POD files.  Vim assumes a file is
Perl code if the filename has a .pl or .pm suffix.  Vim also examines the first
line of a file, regardless of the filename suffix, to check if a file is a
Perl script (see scripts.vim in Vim's syntax directory).  Vim assumes a file
is POD text if the filename has a .POD suffix.

To use tags with Perl, you need a recent version of Exuberant ctags.  Look
here:
	http://ctags.sourceforge.net

Alternatively, you can use the Perl script pltags.pl, which is shipped with
Vim in the $VIMRUNTIME/tools directory.  This script has currently more
features than Exuberant ctags' Perl support.

==============================================================================
2. Compiling VIM with Perl interface			*perl-compiling*

To compile Vim with Perl interface, you need Perl 5.004 (or later).  Perl must
be installed before you compile Vim.  Vim's Perl interface does NOT work with
the 5.003 version that has been officially released!  It will probably work
with Perl 5.003_05 and later.

The Perl patches for Vim were made by:
	Sven Verdoolaege <skimo@breughel.ufsia.ac.be>
	Matt Gerassimof

Perl for MS-Windows can be found at: http://www.perl.com/
The ActiveState one should work.

==============================================================================
3. Using the Perl interface				*perl-using*

							*:perl* *:pe*
:pe[rl] {cmd}		Execute Perl command {cmd}.  The current package
			is "main".  Simple example to test if `:perl` is
			working: >
				:perl VIM::Msg("Hello")

:pe[rl] << {endpattern}
{script}
{endpattern}
			Execute Perl script {script}.
			{endpattern} must NOT be preceded by any white space.
			If {endpattern} is omitted, it defaults to a dot '.'
			like for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.  Using
			'.' helps when inside a function, because "$i;" looks
			like the start of an |:insert| command to Vim.
			This form of the |:perl| command is mainly useful for
			including perl code in vim scripts.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Perl feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.


Example vim script: >

	function! WhitePearl()
	perl << EOF
		VIM::Msg("pearls are nice for necklaces");
		VIM::Msg("rubys for rings");
		VIM::Msg("pythons for bags");
		VIM::Msg("tcls????");
	EOF
	endfunction
<

							*:perldo* *:perld*
:[range]perld[o] {cmd}	Execute Perl command {cmd} for each line in the
			[range], with $_ being set to the text of each line in
			turn, without a trailing <EOL>.  Setting $_ will change
			the text, but note that it is not possible to add or
			delete lines using this command.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".

Here are some things you can try: >

  :perl $a=1
  :perldo $_ = reverse($_);1
  :perl VIM::Msg("hello")
  :perl $line = $curbuf->Get(42)
<
							*E299*
Executing Perl commands in the |sandbox| is limited.  ":perldo" will not be
possible at all.  ":perl" will be evaluated in the Safe environment, if
possible.


							*perl-overview*
Here is an overview of the functions that are available to Perl: >

  :perl VIM::Msg("Text")		# displays a message
  :perl VIM::Msg("Error", "ErrorMsg")	# displays an error message
  :perl VIM::Msg("remark", "Comment")	# displays a highlighted message
  :perl VIM::SetOption("ai")		# sets a vim option
  :perl $nbuf = VIM::Buffers()		# returns the number of buffers
  :perl @buflist = VIM::Buffers()	# returns array of all buffers
  :perl $mybuf = (VIM::Buffers('qq.c'))[0] # returns buffer object for 'qq.c'
  :perl @winlist = VIM::Windows()	# returns array of all windows
  :perl $nwin = VIM::Windows()		# returns the number of windows
  :perl ($success, $v) = VIM::Eval('&path') # $v: option 'path', $success: 1
  :perl ($success, $v) = VIM::Eval('&xyz')  # $v: '' and $success: 0
  :perl $v = VIM::Eval('expand("<cfile>")') # expands <cfile>
  :perl $curwin->SetHeight(10)		# sets the window height
  :perl @pos = $curwin->Cursor()	# returns (row, col) array
  :perl @pos = (10, 10)
  :perl $curwin->Cursor(@pos)		# sets cursor to @pos
  :perl $curwin->Cursor(10,10)		# sets cursor to row 10 col 10
  :perl $mybuf = $curwin->Buffer()	# returns the buffer object for window
  :perl $curbuf->Name()			# returns buffer name
  :perl $curbuf->Number()		# returns buffer number
  :perl $curbuf->Count()		# returns the number of lines
  :perl $l = $curbuf->Get(10)		# returns line 10
  :perl @l = $curbuf->Get(1 .. 5)	# returns lines 1 through 5
  :perl $curbuf->Delete(10)		# deletes line 10
  :perl $curbuf->Delete(10, 20)		# delete lines 10 through 20
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, "Line")	# appends a line
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, "Line1", "Line2", "Line3") # appends 3 lines
  :perl @l = ("L1", "L2", "L3")
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, @l)		# appends L1, L2 and L3
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, "Line")	# replaces line 10
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, "Line1", "Line2")	# replaces lines 10 and 11
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, @l)		# replaces 3 lines
<
							*perl-Msg*
VIM::Msg({msg}, {group}?)
			Displays the message {msg}.  The optional {group}
			argument specifies a highlight group for Vim to use
			for the message.

							*perl-SetOption*
VIM::SetOption({arg})	Sets a vim option.  {arg} can be any argument that the
			":set" command accepts.  Note that this means that no
			spaces are allowed in the argument!  See |:set|.

							*perl-Buffers*
VIM::Buffers([{bn}...])	With no arguments, returns a list of all the buffers
			in an array context or returns the number of buffers
			in a scalar context.  For a list of buffer names or
			numbers {bn}, returns a list of the buffers matching
			{bn}, using the same rules as Vim's internal
			|bufname()| function.
			WARNING: the list becomes invalid when |:bwipe| is
			used.  Using it anyway may crash Vim.

							*perl-Windows*
VIM::Windows([{wn}...])	With no arguments, returns a list of all the windows
			in an array context or returns the number of windows
			in a scalar context.  For a list of window numbers
			{wn}, returns a list of the windows with those
			numbers.
			WARNING: the list becomes invalid when a window is
			closed.  Using it anyway may crash Vim.

							*perl-DoCommand*
VIM::DoCommand({cmd})	Executes Ex command {cmd}.

							*perl-Eval*
VIM::Eval({expr})	Evaluates {expr} and returns (success, value) in list 
			context or just value in scalar context.
			success=1 indicates that val contains the value of
			{expr}; success=0 indicates a failure to evaluate
			the expression.  '@x' returns the contents of register
			x, '&x' returns the value of option x, 'x' returns the
			value of internal |variables| x, and '$x' is equivalent
			to perl's $ENV{x}.  All |functions| accessible from
			the command-line are valid for {expr}.
			A |List| is turned into a string by joining the items
			and inserting line breaks.

							*perl-SetHeight*
Window->SetHeight({height})
			Sets the Window height to {height}, within screen
			limits.

							*perl-GetCursor*
Window->Cursor({row}?, {col}?)
			With no arguments, returns a (row, col) array for the
			current cursor position in the Window.  With {row} and
			{col} arguments, sets the Window's cursor position to
			{row} and {col}.  Note that {col} is numbered from 0,
			Perl-fashion, and thus is one less than the value in
			Vim's ruler.

Window->Buffer()					*perl-Buffer*
			Returns the Buffer object corresponding to the given
			Window.

							*perl-Name*
Buffer->Name()		Returns the filename for the Buffer.

							*perl-Number*
Buffer->Number()	Returns the number of the Buffer.

							*perl-Count*
Buffer->Count()		Returns the number of lines in the Buffer.

							*perl-Get*
Buffer->Get({lnum}, {lnum}?, ...)
			Returns a text string of line {lnum} in the Buffer
			for each {lnum} specified.  An array can be passed
			with a list of {lnum}'s specified.

							*perl-Delete*
Buffer->Delete({lnum}, {lnum}?)
			Deletes line {lnum} in the Buffer.  With the second
			{lnum}, deletes the range of lines from the first
			{lnum} to the second {lnum}.

							*perl-Append*
Buffer->Append({lnum}, {line}, {line}?, ...)
			Appends each {line} string after Buffer line {lnum}.
			The list of {line}s can be an array.

							*perl-Set*
Buffer->Set({lnum}, {line}, {line}?, ...)
			Replaces one or more Buffer lines with specified
			{lines}s, starting at Buffer line {lnum}.  The list of
			{line}s can be an array.  If the arguments are
			invalid, replacement does not occur.

$main::curwin
			The current window object.

$main::curbuf
			The current buffer object.


							*script-here*
When using a script language in-line, you might want to skip this when the
language isn't supported.  But this mechanism doesn't work: >
   if has('perl')
     perl << EOF
       this will NOT work!
   EOF
   endif
Instead, put the Perl/Python/Ruby/etc. command in a function and call that
function: >
    if has('perl')
      function DefPerl()
	perl << EOF
	  this works
    EOF
      endfunction
      call DefPerl()
    endif
Note that "EOF" must be at the start of the line.

==============================================================================
4. Dynamic loading					*perl-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Perl library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+perl/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Perl DLL or shared library file only
when needed.  When you don't use the Perl interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim without this file.


MS-Windows ~

You can download Perl from http://www.perl.org.  The one from ActiveState was
used for building Vim.

To use the Perl interface the Perl DLL must be in your search path.
If Vim reports it cannot find the perl512.dll, make sure your $PATH includes
the directory where it is located.  The Perl installer normally does that.
In a console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The name of the DLL must match the Perl version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "perl512.dll".  That is for Perl 5.12.  To know for
sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "perl\d*.dll\c".

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Paul Moore


The Python Interface to Vim				*python* *Python*

1. Commands					|python-commands|
2. The vim module				|python-vim|
3. Buffer objects				|python-buffer|
4. Range objects				|python-range|
5. Window objects				|python-window|
6. Tab page objects				|python-tabpage|
7. vim.bindeval objects				|python-bindeval-objects|
8. pyeval(), py3eval() Vim functions		|python-pyeval|
9. Dynamic loading				|python-dynamic|
10. Python 3					|python3|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Python 2.x interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+python| feature.
The Python 3 interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+python3| feature.
Both can be available at the same time, but read |python-2-and-3|.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*python-commands*

					*:python* *:py* *E263* *E264* *E887*
:[range]py[thon] {stmt}
			Execute Python statement {stmt}.  A simple check if
			the `:python` command is working: >
				:python print "Hello"

:[range]py[thon] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Python script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Python
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like
for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:python| command is mainly useful for including python code
in Vim scripts.

Example: >
	function! IcecreamInitialize()
	python << EOF
	class StrawberryIcecream:
		def __call__(self):
			print 'EAT ME'
	EOF
	endfunction
<
Note: Python is very sensitive to the indenting.  Make sure the "class" line
and "EOF" do not have any indent.

							*:pydo*
:[range]pydo {body}	Execute Python function "def _vim_pydo(line, linenr):
			{body}" for each line in the [range], with the
			function arguments being set to the text of each line
			in turn, without a trailing <EOL>, and the current
			line number. The function should return a string or
			None. If a string is returned, it becomes the text of
			the line in the current turn. The default for [range]
			is the whole file: "1,$".
			{not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:pydo return "%s\t%d" % (line[::-1], len(line))
	:pydo if line: return "%4d: %s" % (linenr, line)
<
							*:pyfile* *:pyf*
:[range]pyf[ile] {file}
			Execute the Python script in {file}.  The whole
			argument is used as a single file name.  {not in Vi}

Both of these commands do essentially the same thing - they execute a piece of
Python code, with the "current range" |python-range| set to the given line
range.

In the case of :python, the code to execute is in the command-line.
In the case of :pyfile, the code to execute is the contents of the given file.

Python commands cannot be used in the |sandbox|.

To pass arguments you need to set sys.argv[] explicitly.  Example: >

	:python import sys
	:python sys.argv = ["foo", "bar"]
	:pyfile myscript.py

Here are some examples					*python-examples*  >

	:python from vim import *
	:python from string import upper
	:python current.line = upper(current.line)
	:python print "Hello"
	:python str = current.buffer[42]

(Note that changes - like the imports - persist from one command to the next,
just like in the Python interpreter.)

==============================================================================
2. The vim module					*python-vim*

Python code gets all of its access to vim (with one exception - see
|python-output| below) via the "vim" module.  The vim module implements two
methods, three constants, and one error object.  You need to import the vim
module before using it: >
	:python import vim

Overview >
	:py print "Hello"		# displays a message
	:py vim.command(cmd)		# execute an Ex command
	:py w = vim.windows[n]		# gets window "n"
	:py cw = vim.current.window	# gets the current window
	:py b = vim.buffers[n]		# gets buffer "n"
	:py cb = vim.current.buffer	# gets the current buffer
	:py w.height = lines		# sets the window height
	:py w.cursor = (row, col)	# sets the window cursor position
	:py pos = w.cursor		# gets a tuple (row, col)
	:py name = b.name		# gets the buffer file name
	:py line = b[n]			# gets a line from the buffer
	:py lines = b[n:m]		# gets a list of lines
	:py num = len(b)		# gets the number of lines
	:py b[n] = str			# sets a line in the buffer
	:py b[n:m] = [str1, str2, str3]	# sets a number of lines at once
	:py del b[n]			# deletes a line
	:py del b[n:m]			# deletes a number of lines


Methods of the "vim" module

vim.command(str)					*python-command*
	Executes the vim (ex-mode) command str.  Returns None.
	Examples: >
	    :py vim.command("set tw=72")
	    :py vim.command("%s/aaa/bbb/g")
<	The following definition executes Normal mode commands: >
		def normal(str):
			vim.command("normal "+str)
		# Note the use of single quotes to delimit a string containing
		# double quotes
		normal('"a2dd"aP')
<								*E659*
	The ":python" command cannot be used recursively with Python 2.2 and
	older.  This only works with Python 2.3 and later: >
	    :py vim.command("python print 'Hello again Python'")

vim.eval(str)						*python-eval*
	Evaluates the expression str using the vim internal expression
	evaluator (see |expression|).  Returns the expression result as:
	- a string if the Vim expression evaluates to a string or number
	- a list if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim list
	- a dictionary if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim dictionary
	Dictionaries and lists are recursively expanded.
	Examples: >
	    :py text_width = vim.eval("&tw")
	    :py str = vim.eval("12+12")		# NB result is a string! Use
						# string.atoi() to convert to
						# a number.

	    :py tagList = vim.eval('taglist("eval_expr")')
<	The latter will return a python list of python dicts, for instance:
	[{'cmd': '/^eval_expr(arg, nextcmd)$/', 'static': 0, 'name':
	'eval_expr', 'kind': 'f', 'filename': './src/eval.c'}]

vim.bindeval(str)					*python-bindeval*
	Like |python-eval|, but returns special objects described in 
	|python-bindeval-objects|. These python objects let you modify (|List| 
	or |Dictionary|) or call (|Funcref|) vim objects.

vim.strwidth(str)					*python-strwidth*
	Like |strwidth()|: returns number of display cells str occupies, tab 
	is counted as one cell.

vim.foreach_rtp(callable)				*python-foreach_rtp*
	Call the given callable for each path in 'runtimepath' until either 
	callable returns something but None, the exception is raised or there 
	are no longer paths. If stopped in case callable returned non-None, 
	vim.foreach_rtp function returns the value returned by callable.

vim.chdir(*args, **kwargs)				*python-chdir*
vim.fchdir(*args, **kwargs)				*python-fchdir*
	Run os.chdir or os.fchdir, then all appropriate vim stuff.
	Note: you should not use these functions directly, use os.chdir and 
	      os.fchdir instead. Behavior of vim.fchdir is undefined in case 
	      os.fchdir does not exist.

Error object of the "vim" module

vim.error						*python-error*
	Upon encountering a Vim error, Python raises an exception of type
	vim.error.
	Example: >
		try:
			vim.command("put a")
		except vim.error:
			# nothing in register a

Constants of the "vim" module

	Note that these are not actually constants - you could reassign them.
	But this is silly, as you would then lose access to the vim objects
	to which the variables referred.

vim.buffers						*python-buffers*
	A mapping object providing access to the list of vim buffers.  The
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py b = vim.buffers[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py b in vim.buffers	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.buffers)	# Number of elements
	    :py for b in vim.buffers:	# Iterating over buffer list
<
vim.windows						*python-windows*
	A sequence object providing access to the list of vim windows.  The
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py w = vim.windows[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py w in vim.windows	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.windows)	# Number of elements
	    :py for w in vim.windows:	# Sequential access
<	Note: vim.windows object always accesses current tab page. 
	|python-tabpage|.windows objects are bound to parent |python-tabpage| 
	object and always use windows from that tab page (or throw vim.error 
	in case tab page was deleted). You can keep a reference to both 
	without keeping a reference to vim module object or |python-tabpage|, 
	they will not lose their properties in this case.

vim.tabpages						*python-tabpages*
	A sequence object providing access to the list of vim tab pages. The 
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py t = vim.tabpages[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py t in vim.tabpages	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.tabpages)	# Number of elements
	    :py for t in vim.tabpages:	# Sequential access
<
vim.current						*python-current*
	An object providing access (via specific attributes) to various
	"current" objects available in vim:
		vim.current.line	The current line (RW)		String
		vim.current.buffer	The current buffer (RW)		Buffer
		vim.current.window	The current window (RW)		Window
		vim.current.tabpage	The current tab page (RW)	TabPage
		vim.current.range	The current line range (RO)	Range

	The last case deserves a little explanation.  When the :python or
	:pyfile command specifies a range, this range of lines becomes the
	"current range".  A range is a bit like a buffer, but with all access
	restricted to a subset of lines.  See |python-range| for more details.

	Note: When assigning to vim.current.{buffer,window,tabpage} it expects 
	valid |python-buffer|, |python-window| or |python-tabpage| objects 
	respectively. Assigning triggers normal (with |autocommand|s) 
	switching to given buffer, window or tab page. It is the only way to 
	switch UI objects in python: you can't assign to 
	|python-tabpage|.window attribute. To switch without triggering 
	autocommands use >
	    py << EOF
	    saved_eventignore = vim.options['eventignore']
	    vim.options['eventignore'] = 'all'
	    try:
	        vim.current.buffer = vim.buffers[2] # Switch to buffer 2
	    finally:
	        vim.options['eventignore'] = saved_eventignore
	    EOF
<
vim.vars						*python-vars*
vim.vvars						*python-vvars*
	Dictionary-like objects holding dictionaries with global (|g:|) and 
	vim (|v:|) variables respectively. Identical to `vim.bindeval("g:")`, 
	but faster.

vim.options						*python-options*
	Object partly supporting mapping protocol (supports setting and 
	getting items) providing a read-write access to global options.
	Note: unlike |:set| this provides access only to global options. You
	cannot use this object to obtain or set local options' values or
	access local-only options in any fashion. Raises KeyError if no global
	option with such name exists (i.e. does not raise KeyError for
	|global-local| options and global only options, but does for window-
	and buffer-local ones).  Use |python-buffer| objects to access to
	buffer-local options and |python-window| objects to access to
	window-local options.

	Type of this object is available via "Options" attribute of vim 
	module.

Output from Python					*python-output*
	Vim displays all Python code output in the Vim message area.  Normal
	output appears as information messages, and error output appears as
	error messages.

	In implementation terms, this means that all output to sys.stdout
	(including the output from print statements) appears as information
	messages, and all output to sys.stderr (including error tracebacks)
	appears as error messages.

							*python-input*
	Input (via sys.stdin, including input() and raw_input()) is not
	supported, and may cause the program to crash.  This should probably be
	fixed.

		    *python2-directory* *python3-directory* *pythonx-directory*
Python 'runtimepath' handling				*python-special-path*

In python vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH special directory is used as a replacement for 
the list of paths found in 'runtimepath': with this directory in sys.path and 
vim.path_hooks in sys.path_hooks python will try to load module from 
{rtp}/python2 (or python3) and {rtp}/pythonx (for both python versions) for 
each {rtp} found in 'runtimepath'.

Implementation is similar to the following, but written in C: >

    from imp import find_module, load_module
    import vim
    import sys

    class VimModuleLoader(object):
        def __init__(self, module):
            self.module = module

        def load_module(self, fullname, path=None):
            return self.module

    def _find_module(fullname, oldtail, path):
        idx = oldtail.find('.')
        if idx > 0:
            name = oldtail[:idx]
            tail = oldtail[idx+1:]
            fmr = find_module(name, path)
            module = load_module(fullname[:-len(oldtail)] + name, *fmr)
            return _find_module(fullname, tail, module.__path__)
        else:
            fmr = find_module(fullname, path)
            return load_module(fullname, *fmr)

    # It uses vim module itself in place of VimPathFinder class: it does not 
    # matter for python which object has find_module function attached to as 
    # an attribute.
    class VimPathFinder(object):
        @classmethod
        def find_module(cls, fullname, path=None):
            try:
                return VimModuleLoader(_find_module(fullname, fullname, path or vim._get_paths()))
            except ImportError:
                return None

        @classmethod
        def load_module(cls, fullname, path=None):
            return _find_module(fullname, fullname, path or vim._get_paths())

    def hook(path):
        if path == vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH:
            return VimPathFinder
        else:
            raise ImportError

    sys.path_hooks.append(hook)

vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH					*python-VIM_SPECIAL_PATH*
	String constant used in conjunction with vim path hook. If path hook 
	installed by vim is requested to handle anything but path equal to 
	vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH constant it raises ImportError. In the only other 
	case it uses special loader.

	Note: you must not use value of this constant directly, always use 
	      vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH object.

vim.find_module(...)					*python-find_module*
vim.path_hook(path)					*python-path_hook*
	Methods or objects used to implement path loading as described above. 
	You should not be using any of these directly except for vim.path_hook 
	in case you need to do something with sys.meta_path. It is not 
	guaranteed that any of the objects will exist in the future vim 
	versions.

vim._get_paths						*python-_get_paths*
	Methods returning a list of paths which will be searched for by path 
	hook. You should not rely on this method being present in future 
	versions, but can use it for debugging.

	It returns a list of {rtp}/python2 (or {rtp}/python3) and 
	{rtp}/pythonx directories for each {rtp} in 'runtimepath'.

==============================================================================
3. Buffer objects					*python-buffer*

Buffer objects represent vim buffers.  You can obtain them in a number of ways:
	- via vim.current.buffer (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.buffers (|python-buffers|)
	- from the "buffer" attribute of a window (|python-window|)

Buffer objects have two read-only attributes - name - the full file name for
the buffer, and number - the buffer number.  They also have three methods
(append, mark, and range; see below).

You can also treat buffer objects as sequence objects.  In this context, they
act as if they were lists (yes, they are mutable) of strings, with each
element being a line of the buffer.  All of the usual sequence operations,
including indexing, index assignment, slicing and slice assignment, work as
you would expect.  Note that the result of indexing (slicing) a buffer is a
string (list of strings).  This has one unusual consequence - b[:] is different
from b.  In particular, "b[:] = None" deletes the whole of the buffer, whereas
"b = None" merely updates the variable b, with no effect on the buffer.

Buffer indexes start at zero, as is normal in Python.  This differs from vim
line numbers, which start from 1.  This is particularly relevant when dealing
with marks (see below) which use vim line numbers.

The buffer object attributes are:
	b.vars		Dictionary-like object used to access 
			|buffer-variable|s.
	b.options	Mapping object (supports item getting, setting and 
			deleting) that provides access to buffer-local options 
			and buffer-local values of |global-local| options. Use 
			|python-window|.options if option is window-local, 
			this object will raise KeyError. If option is 
			|global-local| and local value is missing getting it 
			will return None.
	b.name		String, RW. Contains buffer name (full path).
			Note: when assigning to b.name |BufFilePre| and 
			|BufFilePost| autocommands are launched.
	b.number	Buffer number. Can be used as |python-buffers| key.
			Read-only.
	b.valid		True or False. Buffer object becomes invalid when 
			corresponding buffer is wiped out.

The buffer object methods are:
	b.append(str)	Append a line to the buffer
	b.append(str, nr)  Idem, below line "nr"
	b.append(list)	Append a list of lines to the buffer
			Note that the option of supplying a list of strings to
			the append method differs from the equivalent method
			for Python's built-in list objects.
	b.append(list, nr)  Idem, below line "nr"
	b.mark(name)	Return a tuple (row,col) representing the position
			of the named mark (can also get the []"<> marks)
	b.range(s,e)	Return a range object (see |python-range|) which
			represents the part of the given buffer between line
			numbers s and e |inclusive|.

Note that when adding a line it must not contain a line break character '\n'.
A trailing '\n' is allowed and ignored, so that you can do: >
	:py b.append(f.readlines())

Buffer object type is available using "Buffer" attribute of vim module.

Examples (assume b is the current buffer) >
	:py print b.name		# write the buffer file name
	:py b[0] = "hello!!!"		# replace the top line
	:py b[:] = None			# delete the whole buffer
	:py del b[:]			# delete the whole buffer
	:py b[0:0] = [ "a line" ]	# add a line at the top
	:py del b[2]			# delete a line (the third)
	:py b.append("bottom")		# add a line at the bottom
	:py n = len(b)			# number of lines
	:py (row,col) = b.mark('a')	# named mark
	:py r = b.range(1,5)		# a sub-range of the buffer
	:py b.vars["foo"] = "bar"	# assign b:foo variable
	:py b.options["ff"] = "dos"	# set fileformat
	:py del b.options["ar"]		# same as :set autoread<

==============================================================================
4. Range objects					*python-range*

Range objects represent a part of a vim buffer.  You can obtain them in a
number of ways:
	- via vim.current.range (|python-current|)
	- from a buffer's range() method (|python-buffer|)

A range object is almost identical in operation to a buffer object.  However,
all operations are restricted to the lines within the range (this line range
can, of course, change as a result of slice assignments, line deletions, or
the range.append() method).

The range object attributes are:
	r.start		Index of first line into the buffer
	r.end		Index of last line into the buffer

The range object methods are:
	r.append(str)	Append a line to the range
	r.append(str, nr)  Idem, after line "nr"
	r.append(list)	Append a list of lines to the range
			Note that the option of supplying a list of strings to
			the append method differs from the equivalent method
			for Python's built-in list objects.
	r.append(list, nr)  Idem, after line "nr"

Range object type is available using "Range" attribute of vim module.

Example (assume r is the current range):
	# Send all lines in a range to the default printer
	vim.command("%d,%dhardcopy!" % (r.start+1,r.end+1))

==============================================================================
5. Window objects					*python-window*

Window objects represent vim windows.  You can obtain them in a number of ways:
	- via vim.current.window (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.windows (|python-windows|)
	- from indexing "windows" attribute of a tab page (|python-tabpage|)
	- from the "window" attribute of a tab page (|python-tabpage|)

You can manipulate window objects only through their attributes.  They have no
methods, and no sequence or other interface.

Window attributes are:
	buffer (read-only)	The buffer displayed in this window
	cursor (read-write)	The current cursor position in the window
				This is a tuple, (row,col).
	height (read-write)	The window height, in rows
	width (read-write)	The window width, in columns
	vars (read-only)	The window |w:| variables. Attribute is 
				unassignable, but you can change window 
				variables this way
	options (read-only)	The window-local options. Attribute is 
				unassignable, but you can change window 
				options this way. Provides access only to 
				window-local options, for buffer-local use 
				|python-buffer| and for global ones use 
				|python-options|. If option is |global-local| 
				and local value is missing getting it will 
				return None.
	number (read-only)	Window number.  The first window has number 1.
				This is zero in case it cannot be determined
				(e.g. when the window object belongs to other
				tab page).
	row, col (read-only)	On-screen window position in display cells.
				First position is zero.
	tabpage (read-only)	Window tab page.
	valid (read-write)	True or False. Window object becomes invalid 
				when corresponding window is closed.

The height attribute is writable only if the screen is split horizontally.
The width attribute is writable only if the screen is split vertically.

Window object type is available using "Window" attribute of vim module.

==============================================================================
6. Tab page objects					*python-tabpage*

Tab page objects represent vim tab pages. You can obtain them in a number of 
ways:
	- via vim.current.tabpage (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.tabpages (|python-tabpages|)

You can use this object to access tab page windows. They have no methods and 
no sequence or other interfaces.

Tab page attributes are:
	number		The tab page number like the one returned by 
			|tabpagenr()|.
	windows		Like |python-windows|, but for current tab page.
	vars		The tab page |t:| variables.
	window		Current tabpage window.
	valid		True or False. Tab page object becomes invalid when 
			corresponding tab page is closed.

TabPage object type is available using "TabPage" attribute of vim module.

==============================================================================
7. vim.bindeval objects				*python-bindeval-objects*

vim.Dictionary object				*python-Dictionary*
    Dictionary-like object providing access to vim |Dictionary| type.
    Attributes:
        Attribute  Description ~
        locked     One of                       *python-.locked*
                    Value           Description ~
                    zero            Variable is not locked
                    vim.VAR_LOCKED  Variable is locked, but can be unlocked
                    vim.VAR_FIXED   Variable is locked and can't be unlocked
                   Read-write. You can unlock locked variable by assigning 
                   `True` or `False` to this attribute. No recursive locking 
                   is supported.
        scope      One of
                    Value              Description ~
                    zero               Dictionary is not a scope one
                    vim.VAR_DEF_SCOPE  |g:| or |l:| dictionary
                    vim.VAR_SCOPE      Other scope dictionary,
                                       see |internal-variables|
    Methods (note: methods do not support keyword arguments):
        Method      Description ~
        keys()      Returns a list with dictionary keys.
        values()    Returns a list with dictionary values.
        items()     Returns a list of 2-tuples with dictionary contents.
        update(iterable), update(dictionary), update(**kwargs)
                    Adds keys to dictionary.
        get(key[, default=None])
                    Obtain key from dictionary, returning the default if it is 
                    not present.
        pop(key[, default])
                    Remove specified key from dictionary and return 
                    corresponding value. If key is not found and default is 
                    given returns the default, otherwise raises KeyError.
        popitem()
                    Remove random key from dictionary and return (key, value) 
                    pair.
        has_key(key)
                    Check whether dictionary contains specified key, similar 
                    to `key in dict`.

        __new__(), __new__(iterable), __new__(dictionary), __new__(update)
                    You can use `vim.Dictionary()` to create new vim 
                    dictionaries. `d=vim.Dictionary(arg)` is the same as 
                    `d=vim.bindeval('{}');d.update(arg)`. Without arguments 
                    constructs empty dictionary.

    Examples: >
        d = vim.Dictionary(food="bar")		# Constructor
        d['a'] = 'b'				# Item assignment
        print d['a']				# getting item
        d.update({'c': 'd'})			# .update(dictionary)
        d.update(e='f')				# .update(**kwargs)
        d.update((('g', 'h'), ('i', 'j')))	# .update(iterable)
        for key in d.keys():			# .keys()
        for val in d.values():			# .values()
        for key, val in d.items():		# .items()
        print isinstance(d, vim.Dictionary)	# True
        for key in d:				# Iteration over keys
        class Dict(vim.Dictionary):		# Subclassing
<
    Note: when iterating over keys you should not modify dictionary.

vim.List object					*python-List*
    Sequence-like object providing access to vim |List| type.
    Supports `.locked` attribute, see |python-.locked|. Also supports the 
    following methods:
        Method          Description ~
        extend(item)    Add items to the list.

        __new__(), __new__(iterable)
                        You can use `vim.List()` to create new vim lists. 
                        `l=vim.List(iterable)` is the same as 
                        `l=vim.bindeval('[]');l.extend(iterable)`. Without 
                        arguments constructs empty list.
    Examples: >
        l = vim.List("abc")		# Constructor, result: ['a', 'b', 'c']
        l.extend(['abc', 'def'])	# .extend() method
        print l[1:]			# slicing
        l[:0] = ['ghi', 'jkl']		# slice assignment
        print l[0]			# getting item
        l[0] = 'mno'			# assignment
        for i in l:			# iteration
        print isinstance(l, vim.List)	# True
        class List(vim.List):		# Subclassing

vim.Function object				*python-Function*
    Function-like object, acting like vim |Funcref| object. Supports `.name` 
    attribute and is callable. Accepts special keyword argument `self`, see 
    |Dictionary-function|. You can also use `vim.Function(name)` constructor, 
    it is the same as `vim.bindeval('function(%s)'%json.dumps(name))`.

    Examples: >
        f = vim.Function('tr')			# Constructor
        print f('abc', 'a', 'b')		# Calls tr('abc', 'a', 'b')
        vim.command('''
            function DictFun() dict
                return self
            endfunction
        ''')
        f = vim.bindeval('function("DictFun")')
        print f(self={})			# Like call('DictFun', [], {})
        print isinstance(f, vim.Function)	# True

==============================================================================
8. pyeval() and py3eval() Vim functions			*python-pyeval*

To facilitate bi-directional interface, you can use |pyeval()| and |py3eval()| 
functions to evaluate Python expressions and pass their values to VimL.

==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading					*python-dynamic*

On MS-Windows the Python library can be loaded dynamically.  The |:version|
output then includes |+python/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Python DLL file only when needed.
When you don't use the Python interface you don't need it, thus you can use
Vim without this DLL file.

To use the Python interface the Python DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The name of the DLL must match the Python version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "python24.dll".  That is for Python 2.4.  To know for
sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "python\d*.dll\c".

==============================================================================
10. Python 3						*python3*

							*:py3* *:python3*
The `:py3` and `:python3` commands work similar to `:python`.  A simple check
if the `:py3` command is working: >
	:py3 print("Hello")
<							*:py3file*
The `:py3file` command works similar to `:pyfile`.
							*:py3do* *E863*
The `:py3do` command works similar to `:pydo`.


Vim can be built in four ways (:version output):
1. No Python support	    (-python, -python3)
2. Python 2 support only    (+python or +python/dyn, -python3)
3. Python 3 support only    (-python, +python3 or +python3/dyn)
4. Python 2 and 3 support   (+python/dyn, +python3/dyn)

Some more details on the special case 4:  *python-2-and-3*

When Python 2 and Python 3 are both supported they must be loaded dynamically.

When doing this on Linux/Unix systems and importing global symbols, this leads
to a crash when the second Python version is used.  So either global symbols
are loaded but only one Python version is activated, or no global symbols are
loaded. The latter makes Python's "import" fail on libraries that expect the
symbols to be provided by Vim.
							*E836* *E837*
Vim's configuration script makes a guess for all libraries based on one
standard Python library (termios).  If importing this library succeeds for
both Python versions, then both will be made available in Vim at the same
time.  If not, only the version first used in a session will be enabled.
When trying to use the other one you will get the E836 or E837 error message.

Here Vim's behavior depends on the system in which it was configured.  In a
system where both versions of Python were configured with --enable-shared,
both versions of Python will be activated at the same time.  There will still
be problems with other third party libraries that were not linked to
libPython.

To work around such problems there are these options:
1. The problematic library is recompiled to link to the according
   libpython.so.
2. Vim is recompiled for only one Python version.
3. You undefine PY_NO_RTLD_GLOBAL in auto/config.h after configuration.  This
   may crash Vim though.

							*E880*
Raising SystemExit exception in python isn't endorsed way to quit vim, use: >
	:py vim.command("qall!")
<

							*has-python*
You can test what Python version is available with: >
	if has('python')
	  echo 'there is Python 2.x'
  	elseif has('python3')
	  echo 'there is Python 3.x'
	endif

Note however, that when Python 2 and 3 are both available and loaded
dynamically, these has() calls will try to load them.  If only one can be
loaded at a time, just checking if Python 2 or 3 are available will prevent
the other one from being available.

The Ruby Interface to Vim				*ruby* *Ruby*


1. Commands			|ruby-commands|
2. The VIM module		|ruby-vim|
3. VIM::Buffer objects		|ruby-buffer|
4. VIM::Window objects		|ruby-window|
5. Global variables		|ruby-globals|
6. Dynamic loading		|ruby-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}
			*E266* *E267* *E268* *E269* *E270* *E271* *E272* *E273*

The Ruby interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+ruby| feature.

The home page for ruby is http://www.ruby-lang.org/.  You can find links for
downloading Ruby there.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*ruby-commands*

							*:ruby* *:rub*
:rub[y] {cmd}		Execute Ruby command {cmd}.  A command to try it out: >
				:ruby print "Hello"

:rub[y] << {endpattern}
{script}
{endpattern}
			Execute Ruby script {script}.
			{endpattern} must NOT be preceded by any white space.
			If {endpattern} is omitted, it defaults to a dot '.'
			like for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.  This
			form of the |:ruby| command is mainly useful for
			including ruby code in vim scripts.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Ruby feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

Example Vim script: >

	function! RedGem()
	ruby << EOF
	class Garnet
		def initialize(s)
			@buffer = VIM::Buffer.current
			vimputs(s)
		end
		def vimputs(s)
			@buffer.append(@buffer.count,s)
		end
	end
	gem = Garnet.new("pretty")
	EOF
	endfunction
<

						*:rubydo* *:rubyd* *E265*
:[range]rubyd[o] {cmd}	Evaluate Ruby command {cmd} for each line in the
			[range], with $_ being set to the text of each line in
			turn, without a trailing <EOL>.  Setting $_ will change
			the text, but note that it is not possible to add or
			delete lines using this command.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".

							*:rubyfile* *:rubyf*
:rubyf[ile] {file}	Execute the Ruby script in {file}.  This is the same as
			":ruby load 'file'", but allows file name completion.

Executing Ruby commands is not possible in the |sandbox|.

==============================================================================
2. The VIM module					*ruby-vim*

Ruby code gets all of its access to vim via the "VIM" module.

Overview >
	print "Hello"			      # displays a message
	VIM.command(cmd)		      # execute an Ex command
	num = VIM::Window.count		      # gets the number of windows
	w = VIM::Window[n]		      # gets window "n"
	cw = VIM::Window.current	      # gets the current window
	num = VIM::Buffer.count		      # gets the number of buffers
	b = VIM::Buffer[n]		      # gets buffer "n"
	cb = VIM::Buffer.current	      # gets the current buffer
	w.height = lines		      # sets the window height
	w.cursor = [row, col]		      # sets the window cursor position
	pos = w.cursor			      # gets an array [row, col]
	name = b.name			      # gets the buffer file name
	line = b[n]			      # gets a line from the buffer
	num = b.count			      # gets the number of lines
	b[n] = str			      # sets a line in the buffer
	b.delete(n)			      # deletes a line
	b.append(n, str)		      # appends a line after n
	line = VIM::Buffer.current.line       # gets the current line
	num = VIM::Buffer.current.line_number # gets the current line number
	VIM::Buffer.current.line = "test"     # sets the current line number
<

Module Functions:

							*ruby-message*
VIM::message({msg})
	Displays the message {msg}.

							*ruby-set_option*
VIM::set_option({arg})
	Sets a vim option.  {arg} can be any argument that the ":set" command
	accepts.  Note that this means that no spaces are allowed in the
	argument!  See |:set|.

							*ruby-command*
VIM::command({cmd})
	Executes Ex command {cmd}.

							*ruby-evaluate*
VIM::evaluate({expr})
	Evaluates {expr} using the vim internal expression evaluator (see
	|expression|).  Returns the expression result as a string.
	A |List| is turned into a string by joining the items and inserting
	line breaks.

==============================================================================
3. VIM::Buffer objects					*ruby-buffer*

VIM::Buffer objects represent vim buffers.

Class Methods:

current		Returns the current buffer object.
count		Returns the number of buffers.
self[{n}]	Returns the buffer object for the number {n}.  The first number
		is 0.

Methods:

name		Returns the name of the buffer.
number		Returns the number of the buffer.
count		Returns the number of lines.
length		Returns the number of lines.
self[{n}]	Returns a line from the buffer. {n} is the line number.
self[{n}] = {str}
		Sets a line in the buffer. {n} is the line number.
delete({n})	Deletes a line from the buffer. {n} is the line number.
append({n}, {str})
		Appends a line after the line {n}.
line		Returns the current line of the buffer if the buffer is
		active.
line = {str}    Sets the current line of the buffer if the buffer is active.
line_number     Returns the number of the current line if the buffer is
		active.

==============================================================================
4. VIM::Window objects					*ruby-window*

VIM::Window objects represent vim windows.

Class Methods:

current		Returns the current window object.
count		Returns the number of windows.
self[{n}]	Returns the window object for the number {n}.  The first number
		is 0.

Methods:

buffer		Returns the buffer displayed in the window.
height		Returns the height of the window.
height = {n}	Sets the window height to {n}.
width		Returns the width of the window.
width = {n}	Sets the window width to {n}.
cursor		Returns a [row, col] array for the cursor position.
cursor = [{row}, {col}]
		Sets the cursor position to {row} and {col}.

==============================================================================
5. Global variables					*ruby-globals*

There are two global variables.

$curwin		The current window object.
$curbuf		The current buffer object.

==============================================================================
6. Dynamic loading					*ruby-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Ruby library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+ruby/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Ruby DLL file or shared library only
when needed.  When you don't use the Ruby interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim even though this library file is not on your system.

You need to install the right version of Ruby for this to work.  You can find
the package to download from:
http://www.garbagecollect.jp/ruby/mswin32/en/download/release.html
Currently that is ruby-1.9.1-p429-i386-mswin32.zip

To use the Ruby interface the Ruby DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The name of the DLL must match the Ruby version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "msvcrt-ruby191.dll".  That is for Ruby 1.9.1.  To know
for sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "ruby\d*.dll\c".

If you want to build Vim with Ruby 1.9.1, you need to edit the config.h file
and comment-out the check for _MSC_VER.
You may also need to rename the include directory name to match the version,
strangely for Ruby 1.9.3 the directory is called 1.9.1.

SNiFF+ and Vim				    *sniff*

1. Introduction				    |sniff-intro|
2. Commands				    |sniff-commands|
3. Compiling Vim with SNiFF+ interface	    |sniff-compiling|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}  *E275* *E274* *E276* *E278* *E279*

The SNiFF+ interface only works, when Vim was compiled with the |+sniff|
feature.

==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*sniff-intro*

The following features for the use with SNiFF+ are available:

   * Vim can be used for all editing requests
   * SNiFF+ recognizes and updates all browsers when a file is saved in Vim
   * SNiFF+ commands can be issued directly from Vim

How to use Vim with SNiFF+
   1. Make sure SNiFF+ is running.
   2. In the Editor view of the Preferences dialog set the Field named
      'External Editor' to 'Emacs/Vim'.
   4. Start Vim
   5. Connect to SNiFF+ (:sniff connect)

Once a connection is established, SNiFF+ uses Vim for all requests to show or
edit source code.  On the other hand, you can send queries to SNiFF+ with the
:sniff command.

==============================================================================
2. Commands				    *sniff-commands*

			    *:sniff* *:sni*
:sni[ff] request [symbol]   Send request to sniff with optional symbol.
			    {not in Vi}
:sni[ff]		    Display all possible requests and the connection
			    status

Most requests require a symbol (identifier) as parameter.  If it is omitted,
Vim will use the current word under the cursor.
The available requests are listed below:

request		      mapping	description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
connect			sc	Establish connection with SNiFF+.
				Make sure SNiFF+ is prepared for this in the
				Preferences
disconnect		sq	Disconnect from SNiFF+.  You can reconnect any
				time with :sniff connect (or 'sc')
toggle			st	Toggle between implementation
				and definition file
find-symbol		sf	Load the symbol into a Symbol Browser
browse-class		sb	Loads the class into a Class Browser
superclass		ss	Edit superclass of symbol
overridden		so	Edit overridden method of symbol
retrieve-file		srf	Retrieve symbol in current file
retrieve-project	srp	Retrieve symbol in current project
retrieve-all-projects	srP	Retrieve symbol in all projects
retrieve-next		sR	Retrieve symbol using current Retriever
				settings
goto-symbol		sg	Goto definition or implementation of symbol
hierarchy		sh	Load symbol into the Hierarchy Browser
restr-hier		sH	same as above but show only related classes
xref-to			sxt	Start a refers-to query on symbol and
				load the results into the Cross Referencer
xref-by			sxb	Start a referred-by query on symbol
xref-has		sxh	Start a refers-to components query on symbol
xref-used-by		sxu	Start a referred-by as component query on
				symbol
show-docu		sd	Show documentation of symbol
gen-docu		sD	Generate documentation of symbol

The mappings are defined in a file 'sniff.vim', which is part of every SNiFF+
product ($SNIFF_DIR/config/sniff.vim).  This file is sourced whenever Vim
connects to SNiFF+.

==============================================================================
3. Compiling Vim with SNiFF+ interface		*sniff-compiling*

To compile Vim with SNiFF+ support, you need two source files of the extra
archive: if_sniff.c and if_sniff.h.
On Unix: Edit the Makefile and uncomment the line "--enable-sniff".  Or run
configure manually with this argument.
On NT: Specify SNIFF=yes with your make command.

The Tcl Interface to Vim				*tcl* *Tcl* *TCL*

1. Commands				|tcl-ex-commands|
2. Tcl commands				|tcl-commands|
3. Tcl variables			|tcl-variables|
4. Tcl window commands			|tcl-window-cmds|
5. Tcl buffer commands			|tcl-buffer-cmds|
6. Miscellaneous; Output from Tcl	|tcl-misc| |tcl-output|
7. Known bugs & problems		|tcl-bugs|
8. Examples				|tcl-examples|
9. Dynamic loading			|tcl-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands} *E280* *E281*

The Tcl interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+tcl| feature.

WARNING: There are probably still some bugs.  Please send bug reports,
comments, ideas etc to <Ingo.Wilken@informatik.uni-oldenburg.de>

==============================================================================
1. Commands				*tcl-ex-commands* *E571* *E572*

							*:tcl* *:tc*
:tc[l] {cmd}		Execute Tcl command {cmd}.  A simple check if `:tcl`
			is working: >
				:tcl puts "Hello"

:[range]tc[l] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Tcl script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Tcl feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like for
the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:tcl| command is mainly useful for including tcl code in Vim
scripts.

Example: >
	function! DefineDate()
	    tcl << EOF
	    proc date {} {
		return [clock format [clock seconds]]
	    }
	EOF
	endfunction
<

							*:tcldo* *:tcld*
:[range]tcld[o] {cmd}	Execute Tcl command {cmd} for each line in [range]
			with the variable "line" being set to the text of each
			line in turn, and "lnum" to the line number.  Setting
			"line" will change the text, but note that it is not
			possible to add or delete lines using this command.
			If {cmd} returns an error, the command is interrupted.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".
			See |tcl-var-line| and |tcl-var-lnum|.  {not in Vi}

							*:tclfile* *:tclf*
:tclf[ile] {file}	Execute the Tcl script in {file}.  This is the same as
			":tcl source {file}", but allows file name completion.
			{not in Vi}


Note that Tcl objects (like variables) persist from one command to the next,
just as in the Tcl shell.

Executing Tcl commands is not possible in the |sandbox|.

==============================================================================
2. Tcl commands						*tcl-commands*

Tcl code gets all of its access to vim via commands in the "::vim" namespace.
The following commands are implemented: >

	::vim::beep			# Guess.
	::vim::buffer {n}		# Create Tcl command for one buffer.
	::vim::buffer list		# Create Tcl commands for all buffers.
	::vim::command [-quiet] {cmd}	# Execute an Ex command.
	::vim::expr {expr}		# Use Vim's expression evaluator.
	::vim::option {opt}		# Get vim option.
	::vim::option {opt} {val}	# Set vim option.
	::vim::window list		# Create Tcl commands for all windows.

Commands:
	::vim::beep					*tcl-beep*
	Honk.  Does not return a result.

	::vim::buffer {n}				*tcl-buffer*
	::vim::buffer exists {n}
	::vim::buffer list
	Provides access to vim buffers.  With an integer argument, creates a
	buffer command (see |tcl-buffer-cmds|) for the buffer with that
	number, and returns its name as the result.  Invalid buffer numbers
	result in a standard Tcl error.  To test for valid buffer numbers,
	vim's internal functions can be used: >
		set nbufs [::vim::expr bufnr("$")]
		set isvalid [::vim::expr "bufexists($n)"]
<	The "list" option creates a buffer command for each valid buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set bufs [::vim::buffer list]
		foreach b $bufs { $b append end "The End!" }
<	The "exists" option checks if a buffer with the given number exists.
	Example: >
		if { [::vim::buffer exists $n] } { ::vim::command ":e #$n" }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current buffer.

	::vim::command {cmd}				*tcl-command*
	::vim::command -quiet {cmd}
	Execute the vim (ex-mode) command {cmd}.  Any Ex command that affects
	a buffer or window uses the current buffer/current window.  Does not
	return a result other than a standard Tcl error code.  After this
	command is completed, the "::vim::current" variable is updated.
	The "-quiet" flag suppresses any error messages from vim.
	Examples: >
		::vim::command "set ts=8"
		::vim::command "%s/foo/bar/g"
<	To execute normal-mode commands, use "normal" (see |:normal|): >
		set cmd "jj"
		::vim::command "normal $cmd"
<	See also |tcl-window-command| and |tcl-buffer-command|.

	::vim::expr {expr}				*tcl-expr*
	Evaluates the expression {expr} using vim's internal expression
	evaluator (see |expression|).   Any expression that queries a buffer
	or window property uses the current buffer/current window.  Returns
	the result as a string.  A |List| is turned into a string by joining
	the items and inserting line breaks.
	Examples: >
		set perl_available [::vim::expr has("perl")]
<	See also |tcl-window-expr| and |tcl-buffer-expr|.

	::vim::option {opt}				*tcl-option*
	::vim::option {opt} {value}
	Without second argument, queries the value of a vim option.  With this
	argument, sets the vim option to {value}, and returns the previous
	value as the result.  Any options that are marked as 'local to buffer'
	or 'local to window' affect the current buffer/current window.  The
	global value is not changed, use the ":set" command for that.  For
	boolean options, {value} should be "0" or "1", or any of the keywords
	"on", "off" or "toggle".  See |option-summary| for a list of options.
	Example: >
		::vim::option ts 8
<	See also |tcl-window-option| and |tcl-buffer-option|.

	::vim::window {option}				*tcl-window*
	Provides access to vim windows.  Currently only the "list" option is
	implemented.  This creates a window command (see |tcl-window-cmds|) for
	each window, and returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set wins [::vim::window list]
		foreach w $wins { $w height 4 }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current window.

==============================================================================
3. Tcl variables					*tcl-variables*

The ::vim namespace contains a few variables.  These are created when the Tcl
interpreter is called from vim and set to current values. >

	::vim::current		# array containing "current" objects
	::vim::lbase		# number of first line
	::vim::range		# array containing current range numbers
	line			# current line as a string (:tcldo only)
	lnum			# current line number (:tcldo only)

Variables:
	::vim::current					*tcl-var-current*
	This is an array providing access to various "current" objects
	available in vim.  The contents of this array are updated after
	"::vim::command" is called, as this might change vim's current
	settings (e.g., by deleting the current buffer).
	The "buffer" element contains the name of the buffer command for the
	current buffer.  This can be used directly to invoke buffer commands
	(see |tcl-buffer-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(buffer) insert begin "Hello world"
<	The "window" element contains the name of the window command for the
	current window.  This can be used directly to invoke window commands
	(see |tcl-window-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(window) height 10
<
	::vim::lbase					*tcl-var-lbase*
	This variable controls how Tcl treats line numbers.  If it is set to
	'1', then lines and columns start at 1.  This way, line numbers from
	Tcl commands and vim expressions are compatible.  If this variable is
	set to '0', then line numbers and columns start at 0 in Tcl.  This is
	useful if you want to treat a buffer as a Tcl list or a line as a Tcl
	string and use standard Tcl commands that return an index ("lsort" or
	"string first", for example).  The default value is '1'.  Currently,
	any non-zero values is treated as '1', but your scripts should not
	rely on this.  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

	::vim::range					*tcl-var-range*
	This is an array with three elements, "start", "begin" and "end".  It
	contains the line numbers of the start and end row of the current
	range.  "begin" is the same as "start".  This variable is read-only.
	See |tcl-examples|.

	line						*tcl-var-line*
	lnum						*tcl-var-lnum*
	These global variables are only available if the ":tcldo" Ex command
	is being executed.  They contain the text and line number of the
	current line.  When the Tcl command invoked by ":tcldo" is completed,
	the current line is set to the contents of the "line" variable, unless
	the variable was unset by the Tcl command.  The "lnum" variable is
	read-only.  These variables are not in the "::vim" namespace so they
	can be used in ":tcldo" without much typing (this might be changed in
	future versions).  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

==============================================================================
4. Tcl window commands					*tcl-window-cmds*

Window commands represent vim windows.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::window list			|tcl-window|
	"windows" option of a buffer command	|tcl-buffer-windows|
The ::vim::current(window) variable contains the name of the window command
for the current window.  A window command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim window is closed.

Let's assume the name of the window command is stored in the Tcl variable "win",
i.e. "$win" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$win buffer		# Create Tcl command for window's buffer.
	$win command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in windows context.
	$win cursor		# Get current cursor position.
	$win cursor {var}	# Set cursor position from array variable.
	$win cursor {row} {col}	# Set cursor position.
	$win delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when window is closed.
	$win expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in windows context.
	$win height		# Report the window's height.
	$win height {n}		# Set the window's height.
	$win option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in windows context.

Options:
	$win buffer					*tcl-window-buffer*
	Creates a Tcl command for the window's buffer, and returns its name as
	the result.  The name should be stored in a variable: >
		set buf [$win buffer]
<	$buf is now a valid Tcl command.  See |tcl-buffer-cmds| for the
	available options.

	$win cursor					*tcl-window-cursor*
	$win cursor {var}
	$win cursor {row} {col}
	Without argument, reports the current cursor position as a string.
	This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set here [$win cursor]
<	"here(row)" and "here(column)" now contain the cursor position.
	With a single argument, the argument is interpreted as the name of a
	Tcl array variable, which must contain two elements "row" and "column".
	These are used to set the cursor to the new position: >
		$win cursor here	;# not $here !
<	With two arguments, sets the cursor to the specified row and column: >
		$win cursor $here(row) $here(column)
<	Invalid positions result in a standard Tcl error, which can be caught
	with "catch".  The row and column values depend on the "::vim::lbase"
	variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$win delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-window-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the window.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the window
	is closed.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$win delcmd [list puts vimerr "window deleted"]
<	See also |tcl-buffer-delcmd|.

	$win height					*tcl-window-height*
	$win height {n}
	Without argument, reports the window's current height.  With an
	argument, tries to set the window's height to {n}, then reports the
	new height (which might be different from {n}).

	$win command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-window-command*
	$win expr {expr}				*tcl-window-expr*
	$win option {opt} [val]				*tcl-window-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the window represented by $win, instead of the
	current window.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to window' affects the window $win.  Anything that affects or queries
	a buffer uses the buffer displayed in this window (i.e. the buffer
	that is represented by "$win buffer").  See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr|
	and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		$win option number on

==============================================================================
5. Tcl buffer commands					*tcl-buffer-cmds*

Buffer commands represent vim buffers.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::buffer {N}			|tcl-buffer|
	::vim::buffer list			|tcl-buffer|
	"buffer" option of a window command	|tcl-window-buffer|
The ::vim::current(buffer) variable contains the name of the buffer command
for the current buffer.  A buffer command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim buffer is destroyed.  Whenever the buffer's contents are
changed, all marks in the buffer are automatically adjusted.  Any changes to
the buffer's contents made by Tcl commands can be undone with the "undo" vim
command (see |undo|).

Let's assume the name of the buffer command is stored in the Tcl variable "buf",
i.e. "$buf" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$buf append {n} {str}	# Append a line to buffer, after line {n}.
	$buf command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in buffers context.
	$buf count		# Report number of lines in buffer.
	$buf delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when buffer is deleted.
	$buf delete {n}		# Delete a single line.
	$buf delete {n} {m}	# Delete several lines.
	$buf expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in buffers context.
	$buf get {n}		# Get a single line as a string.
	$buf get {n} {m}	# Get several lines as a list.
	$buf insert {n} {str}	# Insert a line in buffer, as line {n}.
	$buf last		# Report line number of last line in buffer.
	$buf mark {mark}	# Report position of buffer mark.
	$buf name		# Report name of file in buffer.
	$buf number		# Report number of this buffer.
	$buf option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in buffers context.
	$buf set {n} {text}	# Replace a single line.
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}	# Replace several lines.
	$buf windows		# Create Tcl commands for buffer's windows.
<
							*tcl-linenumbers*
Most buffer commands take line numbers as arguments.  How Tcl treats these
numbers depends on the "::vim::lbase" variable (see |tcl-var-lbase|).  Instead
of line numbers, several keywords can be also used: "top", "start", "begin",
"first", "bottom", "end" and "last".

Options:
	$buf append {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-append*
	$buf insert {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-insert*
	Add a line to the buffer.  With the "insert" option, the string
	becomes the new line {n}, with "append" it is inserted after line {n}.
	Example: >
		$buf insert top "This is the beginning."
		$buf append end "This is the end."
<	To add a list of lines to the buffer, use a loop: >
		foreach line $list { $buf append $num $line ; incr num }
<
	$buf count					*tcl-buffer-count*
	Reports the total number of lines in the buffer.

	$buf delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-buffer-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the buffer.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the buffer
	is deleted.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$buf delcmd [list puts vimerr "buffer [$buf number] gone"]
<	See also |tcl-window-delcmd|.

	$buf delete {n}					*tcl-buffer-delete*
	$buf delete {n} {m}
	Deletes line {n} or lines {n} through {m} from the buffer.
	This example deletes everything except the last line: >
		$buf delete first [expr [$buf last] - 1]
<
	$buf get {n}					*tcl-buffer-get*
	$buf get {n} {m}
	Gets one or more lines from the buffer.  For a single line, the result
	is a string; for several lines, a list of strings.
	Example: >
		set topline [$buf get top]
<
	$buf last					*tcl-buffer-last*
	Reports the line number of the last line.  This value depends on the
	"::vim::lbase" variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$buf mark {mark}				*tcl-buffer-mark*
	Reports the position of the named mark as a string, similar to the
	cursor position of the "cursor" option of a window command (see
	|tcl-window-cursor|).  This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set mpos [$buf mark "a"]
<	"mpos(column)" and "mpos(row)" now contain the position of the mark.
	If the mark is not set, a standard Tcl error results.

	$buf name
	Reports the name of the file in the buffer.  For a buffer without a
	file, this is an empty string.

	$buf number
	Reports the number of this buffer.  See |:buffers|.
	This example deletes a buffer from vim: >
		::vim::command "bdelete [$buf number]"
<
	$buf set {n} {string}				*tcl-buffer-set*
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}
	Replace one or several lines in the buffer.  If the list contains more
	elements than there are lines to replace, they are inserted into the
	buffer.  If the list contains fewer elements, any unreplaced line is
	deleted from the buffer.

	$buf windows					*tcl-buffer-windows*
	Creates a window command for each window that displays this buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set winlist [$buf windows]
		foreach win $winlist { $win height 4 }
<	See |tcl-window-cmds| for the available options.

	$buf command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-buffer-command*
	$buf expr {expr}				*tcl-buffer-expr*
	$buf option {opt} [val]				*tcl-buffer-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the buffer represented by $buf, instead of the
	current buffer.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to buffer' affects the buffer $buf.  Anything that affects or queries
	a window uses the first window in vim's window list that displays this
	buffer (i.e. the first entry in the list returned by "$buf windows").
	See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr| and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		if { [$buf option modified] } { $buf command "w" }

==============================================================================
6. Miscellaneous; Output from Tcl		*tcl-misc* *tcl-output*

The standard Tcl commands "exit" and "catch" are replaced by custom versions.
"exit" terminates the current Tcl script and returns to vim, which deletes the
Tcl interpreter.  Another call to ":tcl" then creates a new Tcl interpreter.
"exit" does NOT terminate vim!  "catch" works as before, except that it does
not prevent script termination from "exit".  An exit code != 0 causes the ex
command that invoked the Tcl script to return an error.

Two new I/O streams are available in Tcl, "vimout" and "vimerr".  All output
directed to them is displayed in the vim message area, as information messages
and error messages, respectively.  The standard Tcl output streams stdout and
stderr are mapped to vimout and vimerr, so that a normal "puts" command can be
used to display messages in vim.

==============================================================================
7. Known bugs & problems				*tcl-bugs*

Calling one of the Tcl Ex commands from inside Tcl (via "::vim::command") may
have unexpected side effects.  The command creates a new interpreter, which
has the same abilities as the standard interpreter - making "::vim::command"
available in a safe child interpreter therefore makes the child unsafe.  (It
would be trivial to block nested :tcl* calls or ensure that such calls from a
safe interpreter create only new safe interpreters, but quite pointless -
depending on vim's configuration, "::vim::command" may execute arbitrary code
in any number of other scripting languages.)  A call to "exit" within this new
interpreter does not affect the old interpreter; it only terminates the new
interpreter, then script processing continues normally in the old interpreter.

Input from stdin is currently not supported.

==============================================================================
8. Examples:						*tcl-examples*

Here are a few small (and maybe useful) Tcl scripts.

This script sorts the lines of the entire buffer (assume it contains a list
of names or something similar):
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set lines [$buf get top bottom]
	set lines [lsort -dictionary $lines]
	$buf set top bottom $lines

This script reverses the lines in the buffer.  Note the use of "::vim::lbase"
and "$buf last" to work with any line number setting.
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set t $::vim::lbase
	set b [$buf last]
	while { $t < $b } {
		set tl [$buf get $t]
		set bl [$buf get $b]
		$buf set $t $bl
		$buf set $b $tl
		incr t
		incr b -1
	}

This script adds a consecutive number to each line in the current range:
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set i $::vim::range(start)
	set n 1
	while { $i <= $::vim::range(end) } {
		set line [$buf get $i]
		$buf set $i "$n\t$line"
		incr i ; incr n
	}

The same can also be done quickly with two Ex commands, using ":tcldo":
	:tcl set n 1
	:[range]tcldo set line "$n\t$line" ; incr n

This procedure runs an Ex command on each buffer (idea stolen from Ron Aaron):
	proc eachbuf { cmd } {
		foreach b [::vim::buffer list] {
			$b command $cmd
		}
	}
Use it like this:
	:tcl eachbuf %s/foo/bar/g
Be careful with Tcl's string and backslash substitution, tough.  If in doubt,
surround the Ex command with curly braces.


If you want to add some Tcl procedures permanently to vim, just place them in
a file (e.g. "~/.vimrc.tcl" on Unix machines), and add these lines to your
startup file (usually "~/.vimrc" on Unix):
	if has("tcl")
		tclfile ~/.vimrc.tcl
	endif

==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading					*tcl-dynamic*

On MS-Windows the Tcl library can be loaded dynamically.  The |:version|
output then includes |+tcl/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Tcl DLL file only when needed.  When
you don't use the Tcl interface you don't need it, thus you can use Vim
without this DLL file.

To use the Tcl interface the Tcl DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The name of the DLL must match the Tcl version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "tcl83.dll".  That is for Tcl 8.3.  To know for sure
edit "gvim.exe" and search for "tcl\d*.dll\c".

Last change: 2014 Apr 23


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file is about indenting C programs and other files.

1. Indenting C style programs	|C-indenting|
2. Indenting by expression	|indent-expression|

==============================================================================
1. Indenting C style programs				*C-indenting*

The basics for C style indenting are explained in section |30.2| of the user
manual.

Vim has options for automatically indenting C style program files. Many
programming languages including Java and C++ follow very closely the
formatting conventions established with C.  These options affect only the
indent and do not perform other formatting.  There are additional options that
affect other kinds of formatting as well as indenting, see |format-comments|,
|fo-table|, |gq| and |formatting| for the main ones.

Note that this will not work when the |+smartindent| or |+cindent| features
have been disabled at compile time.

There are in fact four main methods available for indentation, each one
overrides the previous if it is enabled, or non-empty for 'indentexpr':
'autoindent'	uses the indent from the previous line.
'smartindent'	is like 'autoindent' but also recognizes some C syntax to
		increase/reduce the indent where appropriate.
'cindent'	Works more cleverly than the other two and is configurable to
		different indenting styles.
'indentexpr'	The most flexible of all: Evaluates an expression to compute
		the indent of a line.  When non-empty this method overrides
		the other ones.  See |indent-expression|.
The rest of this section describes the 'cindent' option.

Note that 'cindent' indenting does not work for every code scenario.  Vim
is not a C compiler: it does not recognize all syntax.  One requirement is
that toplevel functions have a '{' in the first column.  Otherwise they are
easily confused with declarations.

These four options control C program indenting:
'cindent'	Enables Vim to perform C program indenting automatically.
'cinkeys'	Specifies which keys trigger reindenting in insert mode.
'cinoptions'	Sets your preferred indent style.
'cinwords'	Defines keywords that start an extra indent in the next line.

If 'lisp' is not on and 'equalprg' is empty, the "=" operator indents using
Vim's built-in algorithm rather than calling an external program.

See |autocommand| for how to set the 'cindent' option automatically for C code
files and reset it for others.

					*cinkeys-format* *indentkeys-format*
The 'cinkeys' option is a string that controls Vim's indenting in response to
typing certain characters or commands in certain contexts.  Note that this not
only triggers C-indenting.  When 'indentexpr' is not empty 'indentkeys' is
used instead.  The format of 'cinkeys' and 'indentkeys' is equal.

The default is "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e" which specifies that indenting occurs
as follows:

	"0{"	if you type '{' as the first character in a line
	"0}"	if you type '}' as the first character in a line
	"0)"	if you type ')' as the first character in a line
	":"	if you type ':' after a label or case statement
	"0#"	if you type '#' as the first character in a line
	"!^F"	if you type CTRL-F (which is not inserted)
	"o"	if you type a <CR> anywhere or use the "o" command (not in
		insert mode!)
	"O"	if you use the "O" command (not in insert mode!)
	"e"	if you type the second 'e' for an "else" at the start of a
		line

Characters that can precede each key:				*i_CTRL-F*
!	When a '!' precedes the key, Vim will not insert the key but will
	instead reindent the current line.  This allows you to define a
	command key for reindenting the current line.  CTRL-F is the default
	key for this.  Be careful if you define CTRL-I for this because CTRL-I
	is the ASCII code for <Tab>.
*	When a '*' precedes the key, Vim will reindent the line before
	inserting the key.  If 'cinkeys' contains "*<Return>", Vim reindents
	the current line before opening a new line.
0	When a zero precedes the key (but appears after '!' or '*') Vim will
	reindent the line only if the key is the first character you type in
	the line.  When used before "=" Vim will only reindent the line if
	there is only white space before the word.

When neither '!' nor '*' precedes the key, Vim reindents the line after you
type the key.  So ';' sets the indentation of a line which includes the ';'.

Special key names:
<>	Angle brackets mean spelled-out names of keys.  For example: "<Up>",
	"<Ins>" (see |key-notation|).
^	Letters preceded by a caret (^) are control characters.  For example:
	"^F" is CTRL-F.
o	Reindent a line when you use the "o" command or when Vim opens a new
	line below the current one (e.g., when you type <Enter> in insert
	mode).
O	Reindent a line when you use the "O" command.
e	Reindent a line that starts with "else" when you type the second 'e'.
:	Reindent a line when a ':' is typed which is after a label or case
	statement.  Don't reindent for a ":" in "class::method" for C++.  To
	Reindent for any ":", use "<:>".
=word	Reindent when typing the last character of "word".  "word" may
	actually be part of another word.  Thus "=end" would cause reindenting
	when typing the "d" in "endif" or "endwhile".  But not when typing
	"bend".  Also reindent when completion produces a word that starts
	with "word".  "0=word" reindents when there is only white space before
	the word.
=~word	Like =word, but ignore case.

If you really want to reindent when you type 'o', 'O', 'e', '0', '<', '>',
'*', ':' or '!', use "<o>", "<O>", "<e>", "<0>", "<<>", "<>>", "<*>", "<:>" or
"<!>", respectively, for those keys.

For an emacs-style indent mode where lines aren't indented every time you
press <Enter> but only if you press <Tab>, I suggest:
	:set cinkeys=0{,0},:,0#,!<Tab>,!^F
You might also want to switch off 'autoindent' then.

Note: If you change the current line's indentation manually, Vim ignores the
cindent settings for that line.  This prevents vim from reindenting after you
have changed the indent by typing <BS>, <Tab>, or <Space> in the indent or
used CTRL-T or CTRL-D.

						*cinoptions-values*
The 'cinoptions' option sets how Vim performs indentation.  The value after
the option character can be one of these (N is any number):
	N	indent N spaces
	-N	indent N spaces to the left
	Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces
	-Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces to the left

In the list below,
"N" represents a number of your choice (the number can be negative).  When
there is an 's' after the number, Vim multiplies the number by 'shiftwidth':
"1s" is 'shiftwidth', "2s" is two times 'shiftwidth', etc.  You can use a
decimal point, too: "-0.5s" is minus half a 'shiftwidth'.
The examples below assume a 'shiftwidth' of 4.
							*cino->*
	>N    Amount added for "normal" indent.  Used after a line that should
	      increase the indent (lines starting with "if", an opening brace,
	      etc.).  (default 'shiftwidth').

		cino=		    cino=>2		cino=>2s >
		  if (cond)	      if (cond)		  if (cond)
		  {		      {			  {
		      foo;		foo;			  foo;
		  }		      }			  }
<
							*cino-e*

			c3,C0,/0,(2s,us,U0,w0,W0,k0,m0,j0,J0,)20,*70,#0

Vim puts a line in column 1 if:
- It starts with '#' (preprocessor directives), if 'cinkeys' contains '#0'.
- It starts with a label (a keyword followed by ':', other than "case" and
  "default") and 'cinoptions' does not contain an 'L' entry with a positive
  value.
- Any combination of indentations causes the line to have less than 0
  indentation.

==============================================================================
2. Indenting by expression				*indent-expression*

The basics for using flexible indenting are explained in section |30.3| of the
user manual.

If you want to write your own indent file, it must set the 'indentexpr'
option.  Setting the 'indentkeys' option is often useful.  See the
$VIMRUNTIME/indent directory for examples.


REMARKS ABOUT SPECIFIC INDENT FILES ~


CLOJURE					*ft-clojure-indent* *clojure-indent*

Clojure indentation differs somewhat from traditional Lisps, due in part to
the use of square and curly brackets, and otherwise by community convention.
These conventions are not universally followed, so the Clojure indent script
offers a few configurable options, listed below.

If the current vim does not include searchpairpos(), the indent script falls
back to normal 'lisp' indenting, and the following options are ignored.

							*g:clojure_maxlines*

Set maximum scan distance of searchpairpos(). Larger values trade performance
for correctness when dealing with very long forms. A value of 0 will scan
without limits.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_maxlines = 100
<
						*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist*

The 'lispwords' option is a list of comma-separated words that mark special
forms whose subforms must be indented with two spaces.

For example:
>
	(defn bad []
	      "Incorrect indentation")

	(defn good []
	  "Correct indentation")
<
If you would like to specify 'lispwords' with a |pattern| instead, you can use
the fuzzy indent feature:
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent = 1
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns = ['^with', '^def', '^let']
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist =
		\ ['-fn$', '\v^with-%(meta|out-str|loading-context)$']

	" Legacy comma-delimited string version; the list format above is
	" recommended. Note that patterns are implicitly anchored with ^ and $
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns = 'with.*,def.*,let.*'
<
|g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns| and |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist| are
|Lists| of patterns that will be matched against the unquoted, unqualified
symbol at the head of a list. This means that a pattern like "^foo" will match
all these candidates: "foobar", "my.ns/foobar", and "#'foobar".

Each candidate word is tested for special treatment in this order:

	1. Return true if word is literally in 'lispwords'
	2. Return false if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist|
	3. Return true if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns|
	4. Return false and indent normally otherwise

					*g:clojure_special_indent_words*

Some forms in Clojure are indented so that every subform is indented only two
spaces, regardless of 'lispwords'. If you have a custom construct that should
be indented in this idiosyncratic fashion, you can add your symbols to the
default list below.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_special_indent_words =
	   \ 'deftype,defrecord,reify,proxy,extend-type,extend-protocol,letfn'
<
					*g:clojure_align_multiline_strings*

Align subsequent lines in multiline strings to the column after the opening
quote, instead of the same column.

For example:
>
	(def default
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	  enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")

	(def aligned
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	   eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	   enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_multiline_strings = 0
<
						*g:clojure_align_subforms*

By default, parenthesized compound forms that look like function calls and
whose head subform is on its own line have subsequent subforms indented by
two spaces relative to the opening paren:
>
	(foo
	  bar
	  baz)
<
Setting this option changes this behavior so that all subforms are aligned to
the same column, emulating the default behavior of clojure-mode.el:
>
	(foo
	 bar
	 baz)
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_subforms = 0
<

FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-indent*

Block if, select case, where, and forall constructs are indented.  So are
type, interface, associate, block, and enum constructs.  The indenting of
subroutines, functions, modules, and program blocks is optional.  Comments,
labelled statements and continuation lines are indented if the Fortran is in
free source form, whereas they are not indented if the Fortran is in fixed
source form because of the left margin requirements.  Hence manual indent
corrections will be necessary for labelled statements and continuation lines
when fixed source form is being used.  For further discussion of the method
used for the detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.

Do loops ~
All do loops are left unindented by default.  Do loops can be unstructured in
Fortran with (possibly multiple) loops ending on a labelled executable
statement of almost arbitrary type.  Correct indentation requires
compiler-quality parsing.  Old code with do loops ending on labelled statements
of arbitrary type can be indented with elaborate programs such as Tidy
(http://www.unb.ca/chem/ajit/f_tidy.htm).  Structured do/continue loops are
also left unindented because continue statements are also used for purposes
other than ending a do loop.  Programs such as Tidy can convert structured
do/continue loops to the do/enddo form.  Do loops of the do/enddo variety can
be indented.  If you use only structured loops of the do/enddo form, you should
declare this by setting the fortran_do_enddo variable in your .vimrc as
follows >

   let fortran_do_enddo=1

in which case do loops will be indented.  If all your loops are of do/enddo
type only in, say, .f90 files, then you should set a buffer flag with an
autocommand such as >

  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.f90 let b:fortran_do_enddo=1

to get do loops indented in .f90 files and left alone in Fortran files with
other extensions such as .for.

Program units ~
The indenting of program units (subroutines, functions, modules, and program
blocks) is enabled by default but can be suppressed if a lighter, screen-width
preserving indent style is desired.  To suppress the indenting of program
units for all fortran files set the global fortran_indent_less variable in
your .vimrc as follows >

  let fortran_indent_less=1

A finer level of suppression can be achieved by setting the corresponding
buffer-local variable as follows >

  let b:fortran_indent_less=1


HTML				*ft-html-indent* *html-indent* *html-indenting*

This is about variables you can set in your vimrc to customize HTML indenting.

You can set the indent for the first line after <script> and <style>
"blocktags" (default "zero"): >

      :let g:html_indent_script1 = "inc"
      :let g:html_indent_style1 = "inc"
<
      VALUE	MEANING ~
      "zero"	zero indent
      "auto"	auto indent (same indent as the blocktag)
      "inc"	auto indent + one indent step

Many tags increase the indent for what follows per default (see "Add Indent
Tags" in the script).  You can add further tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_inctags = "html,body,head,tbody"

You can also remove such tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_autotags = "th,td,tr,tfoot,thead"

Default value is empty for both variables.  Note: the initial "inctags" are
only defined once per Vim session.

User variables are only read when the script is sourced.  To enable your
changes during a session, without reloading the HTML file, you can manually
do: >

      :call HtmlIndent_CheckUserSettings()

Detail:
  Calculation of indent inside "blocktags" with "alien" content:
      BLOCKTAG   INDENT EXPR	    WHEN APPLICABLE ~
      <script> : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : cindent(v:lnum)    if attributes empty or contain "java"
	       : -1		    else (vbscript, tcl, ...)
      <style>  : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : GetCSSIndent()	    else
      <!-- --> : -1


PHP				*ft-php-indent* *php-indent* *php-indenting*

NOTE:	PHP files will be indented correctly only if PHP |syntax| is active.

If you are editing a file in Unix 'fileformat' and '\r' characters are present
before new lines, indentation won't proceed correctly ; you have to remove
those useless characters first with a command like: >

    :%s /\r$//g

Or, you can simply |:let| the variable PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the
script will silently remove them when Vim loads a PHP file (at each |BufRead|).

OPTIONS: ~

PHP indenting can be altered in several ways by modifying the values of some
global variables:

					*php-comment* *PHP_autoformatcomment*
To not enable auto-formating of comments by default (if you want to use your
own 'formatoptions'): >
    :let g:PHP_autoformatcomment = 0

Else, 't' will be removed from the 'formatoptions' string and "qrowcb" will be
added, see |fo-table| for more information.
-------------

							*PHP_outdentSLComments*
To add extra indentation to single-line comments: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentSLComments = N

With N being the number of 'shiftwidth' to add.

Only single-line comments will be affected such as: >
    # Comment
    // Comment
    /* Comment */
-------------

							*PHP_default_indenting*
To add extra indentation to every PHP lines with N being the number of
'shiftwidth' to add: >
    :let g:PHP_default_indenting = N

For example, with N = 1, this will give:
>
    <?php
	if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
	    if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
		if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
		    $History_lst_sel=0;
		} else
		    $foo="bar";

	$command_hist = TRUE;
    ?>
(Notice the extra indentation between the PHP container markers and the code)
-------------

							*PHP_outdentphpescape*
To indent PHP escape tags as the surrounding non-PHP code (only affects the
PHP escape tags): >
:let g:PHP_outdentphpescape = 0
-------------

							*PHP_removeCRwhenUnix*
To automatically remove '\r' characters when the 'fileformat' is set to Unix: >
    :let g:PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1
-------------

							*PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel*
To indent braces at the same level than the code they contain: >
    :let g:PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1
    
This will give the following result: >
    if ($foo)
	{
	foo();
	}
Instead of: >
    if ($foo)
    {
	foo();
    }

NOTE:	Indenting will be a bit slower if this option is used because some
	optimizations won't be available.
-------------

							*PHP_vintage_case_default_indent*
To indent 'case:' and 'default:' statements in switch() blocks: >
    :let g:PHP_vintage_case_default_indent = 1

In PHP braces are not required inside 'case/default' blocks therefore 'case:'
and 'default:' are indented at the same level than the 'switch()' to avoid
meaningless indentation. You can use the above option to return to the
traditional way.


PYTHON							*ft-python-indent*

The amount of indent can be set for the following situations.  The examples
given are the defaults.  Note that the variables are set to an expression, so
that you can change the value of 'shiftwidth' later.

Indent after an open paren: >
	let g:pyindent_open_paren = '&sw * 2'
Indent after a nested paren: >
	let g:pyindent_nested_paren = '&sw'
Indent for a continuation line: >
	let g:pyindent_continue = '&sw * 2'


R								*ft-r-indent*

Function arguments are aligned if they span for multiple lines. If you prefer
do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
All lines beginning with a comment character, #, get the same indentation
level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have lines
beginning with a single # indented in the 40th column, ## indented as R code,
and ### not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
Any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS does not
indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<

SHELL							*ft-sh-indent*

The amount of indent applied under various circumstances in a shell file can
be configured by setting the following keys in the |Dictionary|
b:sh_indent_defaults to a specific amount or to a |Funcref| that references a
function that will return the amount desired:

b:sh_indent_options['default']	Default amount of indent.

b:sh_indent_options['continuation-line']
				Amount of indent to add to a continued line.

b:sh_indent_options['case-labels']
				Amount of indent to add for case labels.
				(not actually implemented)

b:sh_indent_options['case-statements']
				Amount of indent to add for case statements.

b:sh_indent_options['case-breaks']
				Amount of indent to add (or more likely
				remove) for case breaks.

VERILOG							*ft-verilog-indent*

General block statements such as if, for, case, always, initial, function,
specify and begin, etc., are indented.  The module block statements (first
level blocks) are not indented by default.  you can turn on the indent with
setting a variable in the .vimrc as follows: >

  let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1

then the module blocks will be indented.  To stop this, remove the variable: >

  :unlet b:verilog_indent_modules

To set the variable only for Verilog file.  The following statements can be
used: >

  au BufReadPost * if exists("b:current_syntax")
  au BufReadPost *   if b:current_syntax == "verilog"
  au BufReadPost *     let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1
  au BufReadPost *   endif
  au BufReadPost * endif

Furthermore, setting the variable b:verilog_indent_width to change the
indenting width (default is 'shiftwidth'): >

  let b:verilog_indent_width = 4
  let b:verilog_indent_width = &sw * 2

In addition, you can turn the verbose mode for debug issue: >

  let b:verilog_indent_verbose = 1

Make sure to do ":set cmdheight=2" first to allow the display of the message.


VHDL							*ft-vhdl-indent*

Alignment of generic/port mapping statements are performed by default. This
causes the following alignment example: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
         clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
       );
  END ENTITY sync;

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_genportmap = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
    clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
  );
  END ENTITY sync;

----------------------------------------

Alignment of right-hand side assignment "<=" statements are performed by
default. This causes the following alignment example: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
             (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
             (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_rhsassign = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
    (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
    (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

----------------------------------------

Full-line comments (lines that begin with "--") are indented to be aligned with
the very previous line's comment, PROVIDED that a whitespace follows after
"--".

For example: >

  sig_a <= sig_b; -- start of a comment
                  -- continuation of the comment
                  -- more of the same comment

While in Insert mode, after typing "-- " (note the space " "), hitting CTRL-F
will align the current "-- " with the previous line's "--".

If the very previous line does not contain "--", THEN the full-line comment
will be aligned with the start of the next non-blank line that is NOT a
full-line comment.

Indenting the following code: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
         -- comment 1
               -- comment 2
    --debug_code:
    --PROCESS(debug_in)
         --BEGIN
            --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
             --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
            --  END LOOP;
     --END PROCESS debug_code;

      -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
           -- comment 5

results in: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
                  -- comment 1
                  -- comment 2
  --debug_code:
  --PROCESS(debug_in)
  --BEGIN
  --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
  --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
  --  END LOOP;
  --END PROCESS debug_code;

  -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
                  -- comment 5

Notice that "--debug_code:" does not align with "-- comment 2"
because there is no whitespace that follows after "--" in "--debug_code:".

Given the dynamic nature of indenting comments, indenting should be done TWICE.
On the first pass, code will be indented. On the second pass, full-line
comments will be indented according to the correctly indented code.


VIM							*ft-vim-indent*

For indenting Vim scripts there is one variable that specifies the amount of
indent for a continuation line, a line that starts with a backslash: >

	:let g:vim_indent_cont = &sw * 3

Three times shiftwidth is the default value.

						*Insert* *Insert-mode*
Inserting and replacing text				*mode-ins-repl*

Most of this file is about Insert and Replace mode.  At the end are a few
commands for inserting text in other ways.

An overview of the most often used commands can be found in chapter 24 of the
user manual |usr_24.txt|.

1. Special keys						|ins-special-keys|
2. Special special keys					|ins-special-special|
3. 'textwidth' and 'wrapmargin' options			|ins-textwidth|
4. 'expandtab', 'smarttab' and 'softtabstop'  options	|ins-expandtab|
5. Replace mode						|Replace-mode|
6. Virtual Replace mode					|Virtual-Replace-mode|
7. Insert mode completion				|ins-completion|
8. Insert mode commands					|inserting|
9. Ex insert commands					|inserting-ex|
10. Inserting a file					|inserting-file|

Also see 'virtualedit', for moving the cursor to positions where there is no
character.  Useful for editing a table.

==============================================================================
1. Special keys						*ins-special-keys*

In Insert and Replace mode, the following characters have a special meaning;
other characters are inserted directly.  To insert one of these special
characters into the buffer, precede it with CTRL-V.  To insert a <Nul>
character use "CTRL-V CTRL-@" or "CTRL-V 000".  On some systems, you have to
use "CTRL-V 003" to insert a CTRL-C.  Note: When CTRL-V is mapped you can
often use CTRL-Q instead |i_CTRL-Q|.

If you are working in a special language mode when inserting text, see the
'langmap' option, |'langmap'|, on how to avoid switching this mode on and off
all the time.

If you have 'insertmode' set, <Esc> and a few other keys get another meaning.
See |'insertmode'|.

char		action	~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
						*i_CTRL-[* *i_<Esc>*
<Esc> or CTRL-[	End insert or Replace mode, go back to Normal mode.  Finish
		abbreviation.
		Note: If your <Esc> key is hard to hit on your keyboard, train
		yourself to use CTRL-[.
		If Esc doesn't work and you are using a Mac, try CTRL-Esc.
		Or disable Listening under Accessibility preferences.
						*i_CTRL-C*
CTRL-C		Quit insert mode, go back to Normal mode.  Do not check for
		abbreviations.  Does not trigger the |InsertLeave| autocommand
		event.

						*i_CTRL-@*
CTRL-@		Insert previously inserted text and stop insert.  {Vi: only
		when typed as first char, only up to 128 chars}
						*i_CTRL-A*
CTRL-A		Insert previously inserted text.  {not in Vi}

						*i_CTRL-H* *i_<BS>* *i_BS*
<BS> or CTRL-H	Delete the character before the cursor (see |i_backspacing|
		about joining lines).
		See |:fixdel| if your <BS> key does not do what you want.
		{Vi: does not delete autoindents}
						*i_<Del>* *i_DEL*
<Del>		Delete the character under the cursor.  If the cursor is at
		the end of the line, and the 'backspace' option includes
		"eol", delete the <EOL>; the next line is appended after the
		current one.
		See |:fixdel| if your <Del> key does not do what you want.
		{not in Vi}
						*i_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W		Delete the word before the cursor (see |i_backspacing| about
		joining lines).  See the section "word motions",
		|word-motions|, for the definition of a word.
						*i_CTRL-U*
CTRL-U		Delete all entered characters in the current line (see
		|i_backspacing| about joining lines).

						*i_CTRL-I* *i_<Tab>* *i_Tab*
<Tab> or CTRL-I Insert a tab.  If the 'expandtab' option is on, the
		equivalent number of spaces is inserted (use CTRL-V <Tab> to
		avoid the expansion; use CTRL-Q <Tab> if CTRL-V is mapped
		|i_CTRL-Q|).  See also the 'smarttab' option and
		|ins-expandtab|.
						*i_CTRL-J* *i_<NL>*
<NL> or CTRL-J	Begin new line.
						*i_CTRL-M* *i_<CR>*
<CR> or CTRL-M	Begin new line.
						*i_CTRL-K*
CTRL-K {char1} [char2]
		Enter digraph (see |digraphs|).  When {char1} is a special
		key, the code for that key is inserted in <> form.  For
		example, the string "<S-Space>" can be entered by typing
		<C-K><S-Space> (two keys).  Neither char is considered for
		mapping.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-N		Find next keyword (see |i_CTRL-N|).  {not in Vi}
CTRL-P		Find previous keyword (see |i_CTRL-P|).  {not in Vi}

CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#*+:.-=}					*i_CTRL-R*
		Insert the contents of a register.  Between typing CTRL-R and
		the second character, '"' will be displayed to indicate that
		you are expected to enter the name of a register.
		The text is inserted as if you typed it, but mappings and
		abbreviations are not used.  If you have options like
		'textwidth', 'formatoptions', or 'autoindent' set, this will
		influence what will be inserted.  This is different from what
		happens with the "p" command and pasting with the mouse.
		Special registers:
			'"'	the unnamed register, containing the text of
				the last delete or yank
			'%'	the current file name
			'#'	the alternate file name
			'*'	the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
			'+'	the clipboard contents
			'/'	the last search pattern
			':'	the last command-line
			'.'	the last inserted text
			'-'	the last small (less than a line) delete
							*i_CTRL-R_=*
			'='	the expression register: you are prompted to
				enter an expression (see |expression|)
				Note that 0x80 (128 decimal) is used for
				special keys.  E.g., you can use this to move
				the cursor up:
					CTRL-R ="\<Up>"
				Use CTRL-R CTRL-R to insert text literally.
				When the result is a |List| the items are used
				as lines.  They can have line breaks inside
				too.
				When the result is a Float it's automatically
				converted to a String.
				When append() or setline() is invoked the undo
				sequence will be broken.
		See |registers| about registers.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-R CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-R*
		Insert the contents of a register.  Works like using a single
		CTRL-R, but the text is inserted literally, not as if typed.
		This differs when the register contains characters like <BS>.
		Example, where register a contains "ab^Hc": >
	CTRL-R a		results in "ac".
	CTRL-R CTRL-R a		results in "ab^Hc".
<		Options 'textwidth', 'formatoptions', etc. still apply.  If
		you also want to avoid these, use "<C-R><C-O>r", see below.
		The '.' register (last inserted text) is still inserted as
		typed.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-R CTRL-O {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-O*
		Insert the contents of a register literally and don't
		auto-indent.  Does the same as pasting with the mouse
		|<MiddleMouse>|.
		Does not replace characters!
		The '.' register (last inserted text) is still inserted as
		typed.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-R CTRL-P {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-P*
		Insert the contents of a register literally and fix the
		indent, like |[<MiddleMouse>|.
		Does not replace characters!
		The '.' register (last inserted text) is still inserted as
		typed.  {not in Vi}

						*i_CTRL-T*
CTRL-T		Insert one shiftwidth of indent at the start of the current
		line.  The indent is always rounded to a 'shiftwidth' (this is
		vi compatible).  {Vi: only when in indent}
						*i_CTRL-D*
CTRL-D		Delete one shiftwidth of indent at the start of the current
		line.  The indent is always rounded to a 'shiftwidth' (this is
		vi compatible).  {Vi: CTRL-D works only when used after
		autoindent}
						*i_0_CTRL-D*
0 CTRL-D	Delete all indent in the current line.  {Vi: CTRL-D works
		only when used after autoindent}
						*i_^_CTRL-D*
^ CTRL-D	Delete all indent in the current line.  The indent is
		restored in the next line.  This is useful when inserting a
		label.  {Vi: CTRL-D works only when used after autoindent}

						*i_CTRL-V*
CTRL-V		Insert next non-digit literally.  For special keys, the
		terminal code is inserted.  It's also possible to enter the
		decimal, octal or hexadecimal value of a character
		|i_CTRL-V_digit|.
		The characters typed right after CTRL-V are not considered for
		mapping.  {Vi: no decimal byte entry}
		Note: When CTRL-V is mapped (e.g., to paste text) you can
		often use CTRL-Q instead |i_CTRL-Q|.

						*i_CTRL-Q*
CTRL-Q		Same as CTRL-V.
		Note: Some terminal connections may eat CTRL-Q, it doesn't
		work then.  It does work in the GUI.

CTRL-X		Enter CTRL-X mode.  This is a sub-mode where commands can
		be given to complete words or scroll the window.  See
		|i_CTRL-X| and |ins-completion|. {not in Vi}

						*i_CTRL-E*
CTRL-E		Insert the character which is below the cursor.  {not in Vi}
						*i_CTRL-Y*
CTRL-Y		Insert the character which is above the cursor.  {not in Vi}
		Note that for CTRL-E and CTRL-Y 'textwidth' is not used, to be
		able to copy characters from a long line.

						*i_CTRL-_*
CTRL-_		Switch between languages, as follows:
		-  When in a rightleft window, revins and nohkmap are toggled,
		   since English will likely be inserted in this case.
		-  When in a norightleft window, revins and hkmap are toggled,
		   since Hebrew will likely be inserted in this case.

		CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text.

		This command is only available when the 'allowrevins' option
		is set.
		Please refer to |rileft.txt| for more information about
		right-to-left mode.
		{not in Vi}
		Only if compiled with the |+rightleft| feature.

						*i_CTRL-^*
CTRL-^		Toggle the use of typing language characters.
		When language |:lmap| mappings are defined:
		- If 'iminsert' is 1 (langmap mappings used) it becomes 0 (no
		  langmap mappings used).
		- If 'iminsert' has another value it becomes 1, thus langmap
		  mappings are enabled.
		When no language mappings are defined:
		- If 'iminsert' is 2 (Input Method used) it becomes 0 (no
		  Input Method used).
		- If 'iminsert' has another value it becomes 2, thus the Input
		  Method is enabled.
		When set to 1, the value of the "b:keymap_name" variable, the
		'keymap' option or "<lang>" appears in the status line.
		The language mappings are normally used to type characters
		that are different from what the keyboard produces.  The
		'keymap' option can be used to install a whole number of them.
		{not in Vi}

						*i_CTRL-]*
CTRL-]		Trigger abbreviation, without inserting a character.  {not in
		Vi}

						*i_<Insert>*
<Insert>	Toggle between Insert and Replace mode.  {not in Vi}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

						*i_backspacing*
The effect of the <BS>, CTRL-W, and CTRL-U depend on the 'backspace' option
(unless 'revins' is set).  This is a comma separated list of items:

item	    action ~
indent	    allow backspacing over autoindent
eol	    allow backspacing over end-of-line (join lines)
start	    allow backspacing over the start position of insert; CTRL-W and
	    CTRL-U stop once at the start position

When 'backspace' is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used.  You cannot
backspace over autoindent, before column 1 or before where insert started.

For backwards compatibility the values "0", "1" and "2" are also allowed, see
|'backspace'|.

If the 'backspace' option does contain "eol" and the cursor is in column 1
when one of the three keys is used, the current line is joined with the
previous line.  This effectively deletes the <EOL> in front of the cursor.
{Vi: does not cross lines, does not delete past start position of insert}

						*i_CTRL-V_digit*
With CTRL-V the decimal, octal or hexadecimal value of a character can be
entered directly.  This way you can enter any character, except a line break
(<NL>, value 10).  There are five ways to enter the character value:

first char	mode	     max nr of chars   max value ~
(none)		decimal		   3		255
o or O		octal		   3		377	 (255)
x or X		hexadecimal	   2		ff	 (255)
u		hexadecimal	   4		ffff	 (65535)
U		hexadecimal	   8		7fffffff (2147483647)

Normally you would type the maximum number of characters.  Thus to enter a
space (value 32) you would type <C-V>032.  You can omit the leading zero, in
which case the character typed after the number must be a non-digit.  This
happens for the other modes as well: As soon as you type a character that is
invalid for the mode, the value before it will be used and the "invalid"
character is dealt with in the normal way.

If you enter a value of 10, it will end up in the file as a 0.  The 10 is a
<NL>, which is used internally to represent the <Nul> character.  When writing
the buffer to a file, the <NL> character is translated into <Nul>.  The <NL>
character is written at the end of each line.  Thus if you want to insert a
<NL> character in a file you will have to make a line break.

						*i_CTRL-X* *insert_expand*
CTRL-X enters a sub-mode where several commands can be used.  Most of these
commands do keyword completion; see |ins-completion|.  These are not available
when Vim was compiled without the |+insert_expand| feature.

Two commands can be used to scroll the window up or down, without exiting
insert mode:

						*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-E*
CTRL-X CTRL-E		scroll window one line up.
			When doing completion look here: |complete_CTRL-E|

						*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-Y*
CTRL-X CTRL-Y		scroll window one line down.
			When doing completion look here: |complete_CTRL-Y|

After CTRL-X is pressed, each CTRL-E (CTRL-Y) scrolls the window up (down) by
one line unless that would cause the cursor to move from its current position
in the file.  As soon as another key is pressed, CTRL-X mode is exited and
that key is interpreted as in Insert mode.


==============================================================================
2. Special special keys				*ins-special-special*

The following keys are special.  They stop the current insert, do something,
and then restart insertion.  This means you can do something without getting
out of Insert mode.  This is very handy if you prefer to use the Insert mode
all the time, just like editors that don't have a separate Normal mode.  You
may also want to set the 'backspace' option to "indent,eol,start" and set the
'insertmode' option.  You can use CTRL-O if you want to map a function key to
a command.

The changes (inserted or deleted characters) before and after these keys can
be undone separately.  Only the last change can be redone and always behaves
like an "i" command.

The CTRL-O command sometimes has a side effect: If the cursor was beyond the
end of the line, it will be put on the last character in the line.  In
mappings it's often better to use <Esc> (first put an "x" in the text, <Esc>
will then always put the cursor on it).  Or use CTRL-\ CTRL-O, but then
beware of the cursor possibly being beyond the end of the line.  Note that the
command following CTRL-\ CTRL-O can still move the cursor, it is not restored
to its original position.

The CTRL-O command takes you to Normal mode.  If you then use a command enter
Insert mode again it normally doesn't nest.  Thus when typing "a<C-O>a" and
then <Esc> takes you back to Normal mode, you do not need to type <Esc> twice.
An exception is when not typing the command, e.g. when executing a mapping or
sourcing a script.  This makes mappings work that briefly switch to Insert
mode.

The shifted cursor keys are not available on all terminals.

Another side effect is that a count specified before the "i" or "a" command is
ignored.  That is because repeating the effect of the command after CTRL-O is
too complicated.

An example for using CTRL-G u: >

	:inoremap <C-H> <C-G>u<C-H>

This redefines the backspace key to start a new undo sequence.  You can now
undo the effect of the backspace key, without changing what you typed before
that, with CTRL-O u.  Another example: >

	:inoremap <CR> <C-]><C-G>u<CR>

This breaks undo at each line break.  It also expands abbreviations before
this.

Using CTRL-O splits undo: the text typed before and after it is undone
separately.  If you want to avoid this (e.g., in a mapping) you might be able
to use CTRL-R = |i_CTRL-R|.  E.g., to call a function: >
	:imap <F2> <C-R>=MyFunc()<CR>

When the 'whichwrap' option is set appropriately, the <Left> and <Right>
keys on the first/last character in the line make the cursor wrap to the
previous/next line.

The CTRL-G j and CTRL-G k commands can be used to insert text in front of a
column.  Example: >
   int i;
   int j;
Position the cursor on the first "int", type "istatic <C-G>j       ".  The
result is: >
   static int i;
	  int j;
When inserting the same text in front of the column in every line, use the
Visual blockwise command "I" |v_b_I|.

==============================================================================
3. 'textwidth' and 'wrapmargin' options			*ins-textwidth*

The 'textwidth' option can be used to automatically break a line before it
gets too long.  Set the 'textwidth' option to the desired maximum line
length.  If you then type more characters (not spaces or tabs), the
last word will be put on a new line (unless it is the only word on the
line).  If you set 'textwidth' to 0, this feature is disabled.

The 'wrapmargin' option does almost the same.  The difference is that
'textwidth' has a fixed width while 'wrapmargin' depends on the width of the
screen.  When using 'wrapmargin' this is equal to using 'textwidth' with a
value equal to (columns - 'wrapmargin'), where columns is the width of the
screen.

When 'textwidth' and 'wrapmargin' are both set, 'textwidth' is used.

If you don't really want to break the line, but view the line wrapped at a
convenient place, see the 'linebreak' option.

The line is only broken automatically when using Insert mode, or when
appending to a line.  When in replace mode and the line length is not
changed, the line will not be broken.

Long lines are broken if you enter a non-white character after the margin.
The situations where a line will be broken can be restricted by adding
characters to the 'formatoptions' option:
"l"  Only break a line if it was not longer than 'textwidth' when the insert
     started.
"v"  Only break at a white character that has been entered during the
     current insert command.  This is mostly Vi-compatible.
"lv" Only break if the line was not longer than 'textwidth' when the insert
     started and only at a white character that has been entered during the
     current insert command.  Only differs from "l" when entering non-white
     characters while crossing the 'textwidth' boundary.

Normally an internal function will be used to decide where to break the line.
If you want to do it in a different way set the 'formatexpr' option to an
expression that will take care of the line break.

If you want to format a block of text, you can use the "gq" operator.  Type
"gq" and a movement command to move the cursor to the end of the block.  In
many cases, the command "gq}" will do what you want (format until the end of
paragraph).  Alternatively, you can use "gqap", which will format the whole
paragraph, no matter where the cursor currently is.  Or you can use Visual
mode: hit "v", move to the end of the block, and type "gq".  See also |gq|.

==============================================================================
4. 'expandtab', 'smarttab' and 'softtabstop' options	*ins-expandtab*

If the 'expandtab' option is on, spaces will be used to fill the amount of
whitespace of the tab.  If you want to enter a real <Tab>, type CTRL-V first
(use CTRL-Q when CTRL-V is mapped |i_CTRL-Q|).
The 'expandtab' option is off by default.  Note that in Replace mode, a single
character is replaced with several spaces.  The result of this is that the
number of characters in the line increases.  Backspacing will delete one
space at a time.  The original character will be put back for only one space
that you backspace over (the last one).  {Vi does not have the 'expandtab'
option}

							*ins-smarttab*
When the 'smarttab' option is on, a <Tab> inserts 'shiftwidth' positions at
the beginning of a line and 'tabstop' positions in other places.  This means
that often spaces instead of a <Tab> character are inserted.  When 'smarttab'
is off, a <Tab> always inserts 'tabstop' positions, and 'shiftwidth' is only
used for ">>" and the like.  {not in Vi}

							*ins-softtabstop*
When the 'softtabstop' option is non-zero, a <Tab> inserts 'softtabstop'
positions, and a <BS> used to delete white space, will delete 'softtabstop'
positions.  This feels like 'tabstop' was set to 'softtabstop', but a real
<Tab> character still takes 'tabstop' positions, so your file will still look
correct when used by other applications.

If 'softtabstop' is non-zero, a <BS> will try to delete as much white space to
move to the previous 'softtabstop' position, except when the previously
inserted character is a space, then it will only delete the character before
the cursor.  Otherwise you cannot always delete a single character before the
cursor.  You will have to delete 'softtabstop' characters first, and then type
extra spaces to get where you want to be.

==============================================================================
5. Replace mode				*Replace* *Replace-mode* *mode-replace*

Enter Replace mode with the "R" command in normal mode.

In Replace mode, one character in the line is deleted for every character you
type.  If there is no character to delete (at the end of the line), the
typed character is appended (as in Insert mode).  Thus the number of
characters in a line stays the same until you get to the end of the line.
If a <NL> is typed, a line break is inserted and no character is deleted.

Be careful with <Tab> characters.  If you type a normal printing character in
its place, the number of characters is still the same, but the number of
columns will become smaller.

If you delete characters in Replace mode (with <BS>, CTRL-W, or CTRL-U), what
happens is that you delete the changes.  The characters that were replaced
are restored.  If you had typed past the existing text, the characters you
added are deleted.  This is effectively a character-at-a-time undo.

If the 'expandtab' option is on, a <Tab> will replace one character with
several spaces.  The result of this is that the number of characters in the
line increases.  Backspacing will delete one space at a time.  The original
character will be put back for only one space that you backspace over (the
last one).  {Vi does not have the 'expandtab' option}

==============================================================================
6. Virtual Replace mode		*vreplace-mode* *Virtual-Replace-mode*

Enter Virtual Replace mode with the "gR" command in normal mode.
{not available when compiled without the |+vreplace| feature}
{Vi does not have Virtual Replace mode}

Virtual Replace mode is similar to Replace mode, but instead of replacing
actual characters in the file, you are replacing screen real estate, so that
characters further on in the file never appear to move.

So if you type a <Tab> it may replace several normal characters, and if you
type a letter on top of a <Tab> it may not replace anything at all, since the
<Tab> will still line up to the same place as before.

Typing a <NL> still doesn't cause characters later in the file to appear to
move.  The rest of the current line will be replaced by the <NL> (that is,
they are deleted), and replacing continues on the next line.  A new line is
NOT inserted unless you go past the end of the file.

Interesting effects are seen when using CTRL-T and CTRL-D.  The characters
before the cursor are shifted sideways as normal, but characters later in the
line still remain still.  CTRL-T will hide some of the old line under the
shifted characters, but CTRL-D will reveal them again.

As with Replace mode, using <BS> etc will bring back the characters that were
replaced.  This still works in conjunction with 'smartindent', CTRL-T and
CTRL-D, 'expandtab', 'smarttab', 'softtabstop', etc.

In 'list' mode, Virtual Replace mode acts as if it was not in 'list' mode,
unless "L" is in 'cpoptions'.

Note that the only situations for which characters beyond the cursor should
appear to move are in List mode |'list'|, and occasionally when 'wrap' is set
(and the line changes length to become shorter or wider than the width of the
screen).  In other cases spaces may be inserted to avoid following characters
to move.

This mode is very useful for editing <Tab> separated columns in tables, for
entering new data while keeping all the columns aligned.

==============================================================================
7. Insert mode completion				*ins-completion*

In Insert and Replace mode, there are several commands to complete part of a
keyword or line that has been typed.  This is useful if you are using
complicated keywords (e.g., function names with capitals and underscores).

These commands are not available when the |+insert_expand| feature was
disabled at compile time.

Completion can be done for:

1. Whole lines						|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|
2. keywords in the current file				|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-N|
3. keywords in 'dictionary'				|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|
4. keywords in 'thesaurus', thesaurus-style		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|
5. keywords in the current and included files		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|
6. tags							|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]|
7. file names						|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-F|
8. definitions or macros				|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
9. Vim command-line					|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V|
10. User defined completion				|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
11. omni completion					|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|
12. Spelling suggestions				|i_CTRL-X_s|
13. keywords in 'complete'				|i_CTRL-N|

All these (except 2) are done in CTRL-X mode.  This is a sub-mode of Insert
and Replace modes.  You enter CTRL-X mode by typing CTRL-X and one of the
CTRL-X commands.  You exit CTRL-X mode by typing a key that is not a valid
CTRL-X mode command.  Valid keys are the CTRL-X command itself, CTRL-N (next),
and CTRL-P (previous).

Also see the 'infercase' option if you want to adjust the case of the match.

							*complete_CTRL-E*
When completion is active you can use CTRL-E to stop it and go back to the
originally typed text.  The CTRL-E will not be inserted.

							*complete_CTRL-Y*
When the popup menu is displayed you can use CTRL-Y to stop completion and
accept the currently selected entry.  The CTRL-Y is not inserted.  Typing a
space, Enter, or some other unprintable character will leave completion mode
and insert that typed character.

When the popup menu is displayed there are a few more special keys, see
|popupmenu-keys|.

Note: The keys that are valid in CTRL-X mode are not mapped.  This allows for
":map ^F ^X^F" to work (where ^F is CTRL-F and ^X is CTRL-X).  The key that
ends CTRL-X mode (any key that is not a valid CTRL-X mode command) is mapped.
Also, when doing completion with 'complete' mappings apply as usual.

Note: While completion is active Insert mode can't be used recursively.
Mappings that somehow invoke ":normal i.." will generate an E523 error.

The following mappings are suggested to make typing the completion commands
a bit easier (although they will hide other commands): >
    :inoremap ^] ^X^]
    :inoremap ^F ^X^F
    :inoremap ^D ^X^D
    :inoremap ^L ^X^L

As a special case, typing CTRL-R to perform register insertion (see
|i_CTRL-R|) will not exit CTRL-X mode.  This is primarily to allow the use of
the '=' register to call some function to determine the next operation.  If
the contents of the register (or result of the '=' register evaluation) are
not valid CTRL-X mode keys, then CTRL-X mode will be exited as if those keys
had been typed.

For example, the following will map <Tab> to either actually insert a <Tab> if
the current line is currently only whitespace, or start/continue a CTRL-N
completion operation: >

	function! CleverTab()
	   if strpart( getline('.'), 0, col('.')-1 ) =~ '^\s*$'
	      return "\<Tab>"
	   else
	      return "\<C-N>"
	   endif
	endfunction
	inoremap <Tab> <C-R>=CleverTab()<CR>



Completing whole lines					*compl-whole-line*

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L*
CTRL-X CTRL-L		Search backwards for a line that starts with the
			same characters as those in the current line before
			the cursor.  Indent is ignored.  The matching line is
			inserted in front of the cursor.
			The 'complete' option is used to decide which buffers
			are searched for a match.  Both loaded and unloaded
			buffers are used.
	CTRL-L	or
	CTRL-P		Search backwards for next matching line.  This line
			replaces the previous matching line.

	CTRL-N		Search forward for next matching line.  This line
			replaces the previous matching line.

	CTRL-X CTRL-L	After expanding a line you can additionally get the
			line next to it by typing CTRL-X CTRL-L again, unless
			a double CTRL-X is used.  Only works for loaded
			buffers.

Completing keywords in current file			*compl-current*

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-P*
							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-N*
CTRL-X CTRL-N		Search forwards for words that start with the keyword
			in front of the cursor.  The found keyword is inserted
			in front of the cursor.

CTRL-X CTRL-P		Search backwards for words that start with the keyword
			in front of the cursor.  The found keyword is inserted
			in front of the cursor.

	CTRL-N		Search forward for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-P		Search backwards for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-X CTRL-N or
	CTRL-X CTRL-P	Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-N or CTRL-X CTRL-P will
			copy the words following the previous expansion in
			other contexts unless a double CTRL-X is used.

If there is a keyword in front of the cursor (a name made out of alphabetic
characters and characters in 'iskeyword'), it is used as the search pattern,
with "\<" prepended (meaning: start of a word).  Otherwise "\<\k\k" is used
as search pattern (start of any keyword of at least two characters).

In Replace mode, the number of characters that are replaced depends on the
length of the matched string.  This works like typing the characters of the
matched string in Replace mode.

If there is not a valid keyword character before the cursor, any keyword of
at least two characters is matched.
	e.g., to get:
	    printf("(%g, %g, %g)", vector[0], vector[1], vector[2]);
	just type:
	    printf("(%g, %g, %g)", vector[0], ^P[1], ^P[2]);

The search wraps around the end of the file, the value of 'wrapscan' is not
used here.

Multiple repeats of the same completion are skipped; thus a different match
will be inserted at each CTRL-N and CTRL-P (unless there is only one
matching keyword).

Single character matches are never included, as they usually just get in
the way of what you were really after.
	e.g., to get:
		printf("name = %s\n", name);
	just type:
		printf("name = %s\n", n^P);
	or even:
		printf("name = %s\n", ^P);
The 'n' in '\n' is skipped.

After expanding a word, you can use CTRL-X CTRL-P or CTRL-X CTRL-N to get the
word following the expansion in other contexts.  These sequences search for
the text just expanded and further expand by getting an extra word.  This is
useful if you need to repeat a sequence of complicated words.  Although CTRL-P
and CTRL-N look just for strings of at least two characters, CTRL-X CTRL-P and
CTRL-X CTRL-N can be used to expand words of just one character.
	e.g., to get:
		M&eacute;xico
	you can type:
		M^N^P^X^P^X^P
CTRL-N starts the expansion and then CTRL-P takes back the single character
"M", the next two CTRL-X CTRL-P's get the words "&eacute" and ";xico".

If the previous expansion was split, because it got longer than 'textwidth',
then just the text in the current line will be used.

If the match found is at the end of a line, then the first word in the next
line will be inserted and the message "word from next line" displayed, if
this word is accepted the next CTRL-X CTRL-P or CTRL-X CTRL-N will search
for those lines starting with this word.


Completing keywords in 'dictionary'			*compl-dictionary*

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K*
CTRL-X CTRL-K		Search the files given with the 'dictionary' option
			for words that start with the keyword in front of the
			cursor.  This is like CTRL-N, but only the dictionary
			files are searched, not the current file.  The found
			keyword is inserted in front of the cursor.  This
			could potentially be pretty slow, since all matches
			are found before the first match is used.  By default,
			the 'dictionary' option is empty.
			For suggestions where to find a list of words, see the
			'dictionary' option.

	CTRL-K	or
	CTRL-N		Search forward for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-P		Search backwards for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T*
CTRL-X CTRL-T		Works as CTRL-X CTRL-K, but in a special way.  It uses
			the 'thesaurus' option instead of 'dictionary'.  If a
			match is found in the thesaurus file, all the
			remaining words on the same line are included as
			matches, even though they don't complete the word.
			Thus a word can be completely replaced.

			For an example, imagine the 'thesaurus' file has a
			line like this: >
				angry furious mad enraged
<			Placing the cursor after the letters "ang" and typing
			CTRL-X CTRL-T would complete the word "angry";
			subsequent presses would change the word to "furious",
			"mad" etc.
			Other uses include translation between two languages,
			or grouping API functions by keyword.

	CTRL-T	or
	CTRL-N		Search forward for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-P		Search backwards for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.


Completing keywords in the current and included files	*compl-keyword*

The 'include' option is used to specify a line that contains an include file
name.  The 'path' option is used to search for include files.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I*
CTRL-X CTRL-I		Search for the first keyword in the current and
			included files that starts with the same characters
			as those before the cursor.  The matched keyword is
			inserted in front of the cursor.

	CTRL-N		Search forwards for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.
			Note: CTRL-I is the same as <Tab>, which is likely to
			be typed after a successful completion, therefore
			CTRL-I is not used for searching for the next match.

	CTRL-P		Search backward for previous matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-X CTRL-I	Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-I will copy the words
			following the previous expansion in other contexts
			unless a double CTRL-X is used.

Completing tags						*compl-tag*
							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]*
CTRL-X CTRL-]		Search for the first tag that starts with the same
			characters as before the cursor.  The matching tag is
			inserted in front of the cursor.  Alphabetic
			characters and characters in 'iskeyword' are used
			to decide which characters are included in the tag
			name (same as for a keyword).  See also |CTRL-]|.
			The 'showfulltag' option can be used to add context
			from around the tag definition.
	CTRL-]	or
	CTRL-N		Search forwards for next matching tag.  This tag
			replaces the previous matching tag.

	CTRL-P		Search backward for previous matching tag.  This tag
			replaces the previous matching tag.


Completing file names					*compl-filename*
							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-F*
CTRL-X CTRL-F		Search for the first file name that starts with the
			same characters as before the cursor.  The matching
			file name is inserted in front of the cursor.
			Alphabetic characters and characters in 'isfname'
			are used to decide which characters are included in
			the file name.  Note: the 'path' option is not used
			here (yet).
	CTRL-F	or
	CTRL-N		Search forwards for next matching file name.  This
			file name replaces the previous matching file name.

	CTRL-P		Search backward for previous matching file name.
			This file name replaces the previous matching file
			name.


Completing definitions or macros			*compl-define*

The 'define' option is used to specify a line that contains a definition.
The 'include' option is used to specify a line that contains an include file
name.  The 'path' option is used to search for include files.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D*
CTRL-X CTRL-D		Search in the current and included files for the
			first definition (or macro) name that starts with
			the same characters as before the cursor.  The found
			definition name is inserted in front of the cursor.
	CTRL-D	or
	CTRL-N		Search forwards for next matching macro name.  This
			macro name replaces the previous matching macro
			name.

	CTRL-P		Search backward for previous matching macro name.
			This macro name replaces the previous matching macro
			name.

	CTRL-X CTRL-D	Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-D will copy the words
			following the previous expansion in other contexts
			unless a double CTRL-X is used.


Completing Vim commands					*compl-vim*

Completion is context-sensitive.  It works like on the Command-line.  It
completes an Ex command as well as its arguments.  This is useful when writing
a Vim script.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V*
CTRL-X CTRL-V		Guess what kind of item is in front of the cursor and
			find the first match for it.
			Note: When CTRL-V is mapped you can often use CTRL-Q
			instead of |i_CTRL-Q|.
	CTRL-V	or
	CTRL-N		Search forwards for next match.  This match replaces
			the previous one.

	CTRL-P		Search backwards for previous match.  This match
			replaces the previous one.

	CTRL-X CTRL-V	Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-V will do the same as
			CTRL-V.  This allows mapping a key to do Vim command
			completion, for example: >
				:imap <Tab> <C-X><C-V>

User defined completion					*compl-function*

Completion is done by a function that can be defined by the user with the
'completefunc' option.  See below for how the function is called and an
example |complete-functions|.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U*
CTRL-X CTRL-U		Guess what kind of item is in front of the cursor and
			find the first match for it.
	CTRL-U	or
	CTRL-N		Use the next match.  This match replaces the previous
			one.

	CTRL-P		Use the previous match.  This match replaces the
			previous one.


Omni completion						*compl-omni*

Completion is done by a function that can be defined by the user with the
'omnifunc' option.  This is to be used for filetype-specific completion.

See below for how the function is called and an example |complete-functions|.
For remarks about specific filetypes see |compl-omni-filetypes|.
More completion scripts will appear, check www.vim.org.  Currently there is a
first version for C++.

							*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O*
CTRL-X CTRL-O		Guess what kind of item is in front of the cursor and
			find the first match for it.
	CTRL-O	or
	CTRL-N		Use the next match.  This match replaces the previous
			one.

	CTRL-P		Use the previous match.  This match replaces the
			previous one.


Spelling suggestions					*compl-spelling*

A word before or at the cursor is located and correctly spelled words are
suggested to replace it.  If there is a badly spelled word in the line, before
or under the cursor, the cursor is moved to after it.  Otherwise the word just
before the cursor is used for suggestions, even though it isn't badly spelled.

NOTE: CTRL-S suspends display in many Unix terminals.  Use 's' instead.  Type
CTRL-Q to resume displaying.

						*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-S* *i_CTRL-X_s*
CTRL-X CTRL-S   or
CTRL-X s		Locate the word in front of the cursor and find the
			first spell suggestion for it.
	CTRL-S	or
	CTRL-N		Use the next suggestion.  This replaces the previous
			one.  Note that you can't use 's' here.

	CTRL-P		Use the previous suggestion.  This replaces the
			previous one.


Completing keywords from different sources		*compl-generic*

							*i_CTRL-N*
CTRL-N			Find next match for words that start with the
			keyword in front of the cursor, looking in places
			specified with the 'complete' option.  The found
			keyword is inserted in front of the cursor.

							*i_CTRL-P*
CTRL-P			Find previous match for words that start with the
			keyword in front of the cursor, looking in places
			specified with the 'complete' option.  The found
			keyword is inserted in front of the cursor.

	CTRL-N		Search forward for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-P		Search backwards for next matching keyword.  This
			keyword replaces the previous matching keyword.

	CTRL-X CTRL-N or
	CTRL-X CTRL-P	Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-N or CTRL-X CTRL-P will
			copy the words following the previous expansion in
			other contexts unless a double CTRL-X is used.


FUNCTIONS FOR FINDING COMPLETIONS			*complete-functions*

This applies to 'completefunc' and 'omnifunc'.

The function is called in two different ways:
- First the function is called to find the start of the text to be completed.
- Later the function is called to actually find the matches.

On the first invocation the arguments are:
   a:findstart  1
   a:base	empty

The function must return the column where the completion starts.  It must be a
number between zero and the cursor column "col('.')".  This involves looking
at the characters just before the cursor and including those characters that
could be part of the completed item.  The text between this column and the
cursor column will be replaced with the matches.

Special return values:
   -1 If no completion can be done, the completion will be cancelled with an
      error message.
   -2 To cancel silently and stay in completion mode.
   -3 To cancel silently and leave completion mode.

On the second invocation the arguments are:
   a:findstart  0
   a:base	the text with which matches should match; the text that was
		located in the first call (can be empty)

The function must return a List with the matching words.  These matches
usually include the "a:base" text.  When there are no matches return an empty
List.

In order to return more information than the matching words, return a Dict
that contains the List.  The Dict can have these items:
	words		The List of matching words (mandatory).
	refresh		A string to control re-invocation of the function
			(optional).
			The only value currently recognized is "always", the
			effect is that the function is called whenever the
			leading text is changed.
Other items are ignored.

For acting upon end of completion, see the |CompleteDone| autocommand event.

For example, the function can contain this: >
	let matches = ... list of words ...
	return {'words': matches, 'refresh': 'always'}
<
						*complete-items*
Each list item can either be a string or a Dictionary.  When it is a string it
is used as the completion.  When it is a Dictionary it can contain these
items:
	word		the text that will be inserted, mandatory
	abbr		abbreviation of "word"; when not empty it is used in
			the menu instead of "word"
	menu		extra text for the popup menu, displayed after "word"
			or "abbr"
	info		more information about the item, can be displayed in a
			preview window
	kind		single letter indicating the type of completion
	icase		when non-zero case is to be ignored when comparing
			items to be equal; when omitted zero is used, thus
			items that only differ in case are added
	dup		when non-zero this match will be added even when an
			item with the same word is already present.
	empty		when non-zero this match will be added even when it is
			an empty string

All of these except 'icase', 'dup' and 'empty' must be a string.  If an item
does not meet these requirements then an error message is given and further
items in the list are not used.  You can mix string and Dictionary items in
the returned list.

The "menu" item is used in the popup menu and may be truncated, thus it should
be relatively short.  The "info" item can be longer, it will  be displayed in
the preview window when "preview" appears in 'completeopt'.  The "info" item
will also remain displayed after the popup menu has been removed.  This is
useful for function arguments.  Use a single space for "info" to remove
existing text in the preview window.  The size of the preview window is three
lines, but 'previewheight' is used when it has a value of 1 or 2.

The "kind" item uses a single letter to indicate the kind of completion.  This
may be used to show the completion differently (different color or icon).
Currently these types can be used:
	v	variable
	f	function or method
	m	member of a struct or class
	t	typedef
	d	#define or macro

When searching for matches takes some time call |complete_add()| to add each
match to the total list.  These matches should then not appear in the returned
list!  Call |complete_check()| now and then to allow the user to press a key
while still searching for matches.  Stop searching when it returns non-zero.

							*E839* *E840*
The function is allowed to move the cursor, it is restored afterwards.
The function is not allowed to move to another window or delete text.

An example that completes the names of the months: >
	fun! CompleteMonths(findstart, base)
	  if a:findstart
	    " locate the start of the word
	    let line = getline('.')
	    let start = col('.') - 1
	    while start > 0 && line[start - 1] =~ '\a'
	      let start -= 1
	    endwhile
	    return start
	  else
	    " find months matching with "a:base"
	    let res = []
	    for m in split("Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec")
	      if m =~ '^' . a:base
		call add(res, m)
	      endif
	    endfor
	    return res
	  endif
	endfun
	set completefunc=CompleteMonths
<
The same, but now pretending searching for matches is slow: >
	fun! CompleteMonths(findstart, base)
	  if a:findstart
	    " locate the start of the word
	    let line = getline('.')
	    let start = col('.') - 1
	    while start > 0 && line[start - 1] =~ '\a'
	      let start -= 1
	    endwhile
	    return start
	  else
	    " find months matching with "a:base"
	    for m in split("Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec")
	      if m =~ '^' . a:base
		call complete_add(m)
	      endif
	      sleep 300m	" simulate searching for next match
	      if complete_check()
		break
	      endif
	    endfor
	    return []
	  endif
	endfun
	set completefunc=CompleteMonths

INSERT COMPLETION POPUP MENU				*ins-completion-menu*
							*popupmenu-completion*
Vim can display the matches in a simplistic popup menu.

The menu is used when:
- The 'completeopt' option contains "menu" or "menuone".
- The terminal supports at least 8 colors.
- There are at least two matches.  One if "menuone" is used.

The 'pumheight' option can be used to set a maximum height.  The default is to
use all space available.

There are three states:
1. A complete match has been inserted, e.g., after using CTRL-N or CTRL-P.
2. A cursor key has been used to select another match.  The match was not
   inserted then, only the entry in the popup menu is highlighted.
3. Only part of a match has been inserted and characters were typed or the
   backspace key was used.  The list of matches was then adjusted for what is
   in front of the cursor.

You normally start in the first state, with the first match being inserted.
When "longest" is in 'completeopt' and there is more than one match you start
in the third state.

If you select another match, e.g., with CTRL-N or CTRL-P, you go to the first
state.  This doesn't change the list of matches.

When you are back at the original text then you are in the third state.  To
get there right away you can use a mapping that uses CTRL-P right after
starting the completion: >
	:imap <F7> <C-N><C-P>
<
						*popupmenu-keys*
In the first state these keys have a special meaning:
<BS> and CTRL-H   Delete one character, find the matches for the word before
		  the cursor.  This reduces the list of matches, often to one
		  entry, and switches to the second state.
Any non-special character:
		  Stop completion without changing the match and insert the
		  typed character.

In the second and third state these keys have a special meaning:
<BS> and CTRL-H   Delete one character, find the matches for the shorter word
		  before the cursor.  This may find more matches.
CTRL-L		  Add one character from the current match, may reduce the
		  number of matches.
any printable, non-white character:
		  Add this character and reduce the number of matches.

In all three states these can be used:
CTRL-Y		  Yes: Accept the currently selected match and stop completion.
CTRL-E		  End completion, go back to what was there before selecting a
		  match (what was typed or longest common string).
<PageUp>	  Select a match several entries back, but don't insert it.
<PageDown>	  Select a match several entries further, but don't insert it.
<Up>		  Select the previous match, as if CTRL-P was used, but don't
		  insert it.
<Down>		  Select the next match, as if CTRL-N was used, but don't
		  insert it.
<Space> or <Tab>  Stop completion without changing the match and insert the
		  typed character.

The behavior of the <Enter> key depends on the state you are in:
first state:	  Use the text as it is and insert a line break.
second state:	  Insert the currently selected match.
third state:	  Use the text as it is and insert a line break.

In other words: If you used the cursor keys to select another entry in the
list of matches then the <Enter> key inserts that match.  If you typed
something else then <Enter> inserts a line break.


The colors of the menu can be changed with these highlight groups:
Pmenu		normal item  |hl-Pmenu|
PmenuSel	selected item  |hl-PmenuSel|
PmenuSbar	scrollbar  |hl-PmenuSbar|
PmenuThumb	thumb of the scrollbar  |hl-PmenuThumb|

There are no special mappings for when the popup menu is visible.  However,
you can use an Insert mode mapping that checks the |pumvisible()| function to
do something different.  Example: >
	:inoremap <Down> <C-R>=pumvisible() ? "\<lt>C-N>" : "\<lt>Down>"<CR>

You can use of <expr> in mapping to have the popup menu used when typing a
character and some condition is met.  For example, for typing a dot: >
	inoremap <expr> . MayComplete()
	func MayComplete()
	    if (can complete)
	      return ".\<C-X>\<C-O>"
	    endif
	    return '.'
	endfunc

See |:map-<expr>| for more info.


FILETYPE-SPECIFIC REMARKS FOR OMNI COMPLETION	    *compl-omni-filetypes*

The file used for {filetype} should be autoload/{filetype}complete.vim
in 'runtimepath'.  Thus for "java" it is autoload/javacomplete.vim.


C							*ft-c-omni*

Completion of C code requires a tags file.  You should use Exuberant ctags,
because it adds extra information that is needed for completion.  You can find
it here: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/  Version 5.6 or later is recommended.

For version 5.5.4 you should add a patch that adds the "typename:" field:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unstable/patches/ctags-5.5.4.patch
A compiled .exe for MS-Windows can be found at:
	http://georgevreilly.com/vim/ctags.html

If you want to complete system functions you can do something like this.  Use
ctags to generate a tags file for all the system header files: >
	% ctags -R -f ~/.vim/systags /usr/include /usr/local/include
In your vimrc file add this tags file to the 'tags' option: >
	set tags+=~/.vim/systags

When using CTRL-X CTRL-O after a name without any "." or "->" it is completed
from the tags file directly.  This works for any identifier, also function
names.  If you want to complete a local variable name, which does not appear
in the tags file, use CTRL-P instead.

When using CTRL-X CTRL-O after something that has "." or "->" Vim will attempt
to recognize the type of the variable and figure out what members it has.
This means only members valid for the variable will be listed.

When a member name already was complete, CTRL-X CTRL-O will add a "." or
"->" for composite types.

Vim doesn't include a C compiler, only the most obviously formatted
declarations are recognized.  Preprocessor stuff may cause confusion.
When the same structure name appears in multiple places all possible members
are included.


CSS							*ft-css-omni*

Complete properties and their appropriate values according to CSS 2.1
specification.


HTML							*ft-html-omni*
XHTML							*ft-xhtml-omni*

CTRL-X CTRL-O provides completion of various elements of (X)HTML files.  It is
designed to support writing of XHTML 1.0 Strict files but will also work for
other versions of HTML. Features:

- after "<" complete tag name depending on context (no div suggestion inside
  of an a tag); '/>' indicates empty tags
- inside of tag complete proper attributes (no width attribute for an a tag);
  show also type of attribute; '*' indicates required attributes
- when attribute has limited number of possible values help to complete them
- complete names of entities
- complete values of "class" and "id" attributes with data obtained from
  <style> tag and included CSS files
- when completing value of "style" attribute or working inside of "style" tag
  switch to |ft-css-omni| completion
- when completing values of events attributes or working inside of "script"
  tag switch to |ft-javascript-omni| completion
- when used after "</" CTRL-X CTRL-O will close the last opened tag

Note: When used first time completion menu will be shown with little delay
- this is time needed for loading of data file.
Note: Completion may fail in badly formatted documents. In such case try to
run |:make| command to detect formatting problems.


HTML flavor						*html-flavor*

The default HTML completion depends on the filetype.  For HTML files it is
HTML 4.01 Transitional ('filetype' is "html"), for XHTML it is XHTML 1.0
Strict ('filetype' is "xhtml").

When doing completion outside of any other tag you will have possibility to
choose DOCTYPE and the appropriate data file will be loaded and used for all
next completions.

More about format of data file in |xml-omni-datafile|. Some of the data files
may be found on the Vim website (|www|).

Note that b:html_omni_flavor may point to a file with any XML data.  This
makes possible to mix PHP (|ft-php-omni|) completion with any XML dialect
(assuming you have data file for it).  Without setting that variable XHTML 1.0
Strict will be used.


JAVASCRIPT					       *ft-javascript-omni*

Completion of most elements of JavaScript language and DOM elements.

Complete:

- variables
- function name; show function arguments
- function arguments
- properties of variables trying to detect type of variable
- complete DOM objects and properties depending on context
- keywords of language

Completion works in separate JavaScript files (&ft==javascript), inside of
<script> tag of (X)HTML and in values of event attributes (including scanning
of external files).

DOM compatibility

At the moment (beginning of 2006) there are two main browsers - MS Internet
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. These two applications are covering over 90% of
market. Theoretically standards are created by W3C organisation
(http://www.w3c.org) but they are not always followed/implemented.

		IE	FF	W3C  Omni completion ~
		+/-	+/-	+    +		     ~
		+	+	-    +		     ~
		+	-	-    -		     ~
		-	+	-    -		     ~

Regardless from state of implementation in browsers but if element is defined
in standards, completion plugin will place element in suggestion list. When
both major engines implemented element, even if this is not in standards it
will be suggested. All other elements are not placed in suggestion list.


PHP							*ft-php-omni*

Completion of PHP code requires a tags file for completion of data from
external files and for class aware completion. You should use Exuberant ctags
version 5.5.4 or newer. You can find it here: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

Script completes:

- after $ variables name
  - if variable was declared as object add "->", if tags file is available show
    name of class
  - after "->" complete only function and variable names specific for given
    class. To find class location and contents tags file is required. Because
    PHP isn't strongly typed language user can use @var tag to declare class: >

	/* @var $myVar myClass */
	$myVar->
<
    Still, to find myClass contents tags file is required.

- function names with additional info:
  - in case of built-in functions list of possible arguments and after | type
    data returned by function
  - in case of user function arguments and name of file where function was
    defined (if it is not current file)

- constants names
- class names after "new" declaration


Note: when doing completion first time Vim will load all necessary data into
memory. It may take several seconds. After next use of completion delay
should not be noticeable.

Script detects if cursor is inside <?php ?> tags. If it is outside it will
automatically switch to HTML/CSS/JavaScript completion. Note: contrary to
original HTML files completion of tags (and only tags) isn't context aware.


RUBY							*ft-ruby-omni*

Completion of Ruby code requires that vim be built with |+ruby|.

Ruby completion will parse your buffer on demand in order to provide a list of
completions.  These completions will be drawn from modules loaded by 'require'
and modules defined in the current buffer.

The completions provided by CTRL-X CTRL-O are sensitive to the context:

	  CONTEXT			   COMPLETIONS PROVIDED ~

 1. Not inside a class definition    Classes, constants and globals

 2. Inside a class definition	     Methods or constants defined in the class

 3. After '.', '::' or ':'	     Methods applicable to the object being
				       dereferenced

 4. After ':' or ':foo'		     Symbol name (beginning with 'foo')

Notes:
 - Vim will load/evaluate code in order to provide completions.  This may
   cause some code execution, which may be a concern. This is no longer 
   enabled by default, to enable this feature add >
     let g:rubycomplete_buffer_loading = 1
<- In context 1 above, Vim can parse the entire buffer to add a list of
   classes to the completion results. This feature is turned off by default,
   to enable it add >
     let g:rubycomplete_classes_in_global = 1
<  to your vimrc
 - In context 2 above, anonymous classes are not supported.
 - In context 3 above, Vim will attempt to determine the methods supported by
   the object.
 - Vim can detect and load the Rails environment for files within a rails
   project. The feature is disabled by default, to enable it add >
     let g:rubycomplete_rails = 1
<  to your vimrc


SYNTAX							*ft-syntax-omni*

Vim has the ability to color syntax highlight nearly 500 languages.  Part of
this highlighting includes knowing what keywords are part of a language.  Many
filetypes already have custom completion scripts written for them, the
syntaxcomplete plugin provides basic completion for all other filetypes.  It
does this by populating the omni completion list with the text Vim already
knows how to color highlight.  It can be used for any filetype and provides a
minimal language-sensitive completion.

To enable syntax code completion you can run: >
    setlocal omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete

You can automate this by placing the following in your |.vimrc| (after any
":filetype" command): >
    if has("autocmd") && exists("+omnifunc")
	autocmd Filetype *
		    \	if &omnifunc == "" |
		    \		setlocal omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete |
		    \	endif
    endif

The above will set completion to this script only if a specific plugin does
not already exist for that filetype.

Each filetype can have a wide range of syntax items.  The plugin allows you to
customize which syntax groups to include or exclude from the list.  Let's have
a look at the PHP filetype to see how this works.

If you edit a file called, index.php, run the following command: >
    syntax list

The first thing you will notice is that there are many different syntax groups.
The PHP language can include elements from different languages like HTML,
JavaScript and many more.  The syntax plugin will only include syntax groups
that begin with the filetype, "php", in this case.  For example these syntax
groups are included by default with the PHP: phpEnvVar, phpIntVar,
phpFunctions.

If you wish non-filetype syntax items to also be included, you can use a 
regular expression syntax (added in version 13.0 of autoload\syntaxcomplete.vim)
to add items.  Looking at the output from ":syntax list" while editing a PHP file 
I can see some of these entries: >
    htmlArg,htmlTag,htmlTagName,javaScriptStatement,javaScriptGlobalObjects

To pick up any JavaScript and HTML keyword syntax groups while editing a PHP
file, you can use 3 different regexs, one for each language.  Or you can 
simply restrict the include groups to a particular value, without using 
a regex string: >
    let g:omni_syntax_group_include_php = 'php\w\+,javaScript\w\+,html\w\+'
    let g:omni_syntax_group_include_php = 'phpFunctions,phpMethods'
<
The basic form of this variable is: >
    let g:omni_syntax_group_include_{filetype} = 'regex,comma,separated'

The PHP language has an enormous number of items which it knows how to syntax
highlight.  These items will be available within the omni completion list.

Some people may find this list unwieldy or are only interested in certain
items.  There are two ways to prune this list (if necessary).  If you find
certain syntax groups you do not wish displayed you can use two different 
methods to identify these groups.  The first specifically lists the syntax 
groups by name.  The second uses a regular expression to identify both 
syntax groups.  Simply add one the following to your vimrc: >
    let g:omni_syntax_group_exclude_php = 'phpCoreConstant,phpConstant'
    let g:omni_syntax_group_exclude_php = 'php\w*Constant'

Add as many syntax groups to this list by comma separating them.  The basic
form of this variable is: >
    let g:omni_syntax_group_exclude_{filetype} = 'regex,comma,separated'

You can create as many of these variables as you need, varying only the
filetype at the end of the variable name.

The plugin uses the isKeyword option to determine where word boundaries are
for the syntax items.  For example, in the Scheme language completion should
include the "-", call-with-output-file.  Depending on your filetype, this may
not provide the words you are expecting.  Setting the
g:omni_syntax_use_iskeyword option to 0 will force the syntax plugin to break
on word characters.   This can be controlled adding the following to your
vimrc: >
    let g:omni_syntax_use_iskeyword = 0

For plugin developers, the plugin exposes a public function OmniSyntaxList.
This function can be used to request a List of syntax items.  When editing a
SQL file (:e syntax.sql) you can use the ":syntax list" command to see the 
various groups and syntax items.  For example: >
    syntax list 

Yields data similar to this: >
    sqlOperator    xxx some prior all like and any escape exists in is not 
                       or intersect minus between distinct
                       links to Operator
    sqlType        xxx varbit varchar nvarchar bigint int uniqueidentifier 
                       date money long tinyint unsigned xml text smalldate 
                       double datetime nchar smallint numeric time bit char 
                       varbinary binary smallmoney
                       image float integer timestamp real decimal

There are two syntax groups listed here: sqlOperator and sqlType.  To retrieve
a List of syntax items you can call OmniSyntaxList a number of different 
ways.  To retrieve all syntax items regardless of syntax group:  >
    echo OmniSyntaxList( [] )

To retrieve only the syntax items for the sqlOperator syntax group: >
    echo OmniSyntaxList( ['sqlOperator'] )

To retrieve all syntax items for both the sqlOperator and sqlType groups: >
    echo OmniSyntaxList( ['sqlOperator', 'sqlType'] )

A regular expression can also be used: >
    echo OmniSyntaxList( ['sql\w\+'] )

From within a plugin, you would typically assign the output to a List: >
    let myKeywords = []
    let myKeywords = OmniSyntaxList( ['sqlKeyword'] )

    

SQL							*ft-sql-omni*

Completion for the SQL language includes statements, functions, keywords.
It will also dynamically complete tables, procedures, views and column lists
with data pulled directly from within a database.  For detailed instructions
and a tutorial see |omni-sql-completion|.

The SQL completion plugin can be used in conjunction with other completion
plugins.  For example, the PHP filetype has its own completion plugin.
Since PHP is often used to generate dynamic website by accessing a database,
the SQL completion plugin can also be enabled.  This allows you to complete
PHP code and SQL code at the same time.


XML							*ft-xml-omni*

Vim 7 provides a mechanism for context aware completion of XML files.  It
depends on a special |xml-omni-datafile| and two commands: |:XMLns| and
|:XMLent|.  Features are:

- after "<" complete the tag name, depending on context
- inside of a tag complete proper attributes
- when an attribute has a limited number of possible values help to complete
  them
- complete names of entities (defined in |xml-omni-datafile| and in the
  current file with "<!ENTITY" declarations)
- when used after "</" CTRL-X CTRL-O will close the last opened tag

Format of XML data file					*xml-omni-datafile*

XML data files are stored in the "autoload/xml" directory in 'runtimepath'.
Vim distribution provides examples of data files in the
"$VIMRUNTIME/autoload/xml" directory.  They have a meaningful name which will
be used in commands.  It should be a unique name which will not create
conflicts.  For example, the name xhtml10s.vim means it is the data file for
XHTML 1.0 Strict.

Each file contains a variable with a name like g:xmldata_xhtml10s . It is
a compound from two parts:

1. "g:xmldata_"  general prefix, constant for all data files
2. "xhtml10s"    the name of the file and the name of the described XML
		 dialect; it will be used as an argument for the |:XMLns|
		 command

Part two must be exactly the same as name of file.

The variable is a |Dictionary|.  Keys are tag names and each value is a two
element |List|.  The first element of the List is also a List with the names
of possible children.  The second element is a |Dictionary| with the names of
attributes as keys and the possible values of attributes as values.  Example: >

    let g:xmldata_crippled = {
    \ "vimxmlentities": ["amp", "lt", "gt", "apos", "quot"],
    \ 'vimxmlroot': ['tag1'],
    \ 'tag1':
    \ [ ['childoftag1a', 'childoftag1b'], {'attroftag1a': [],
    \ 'attroftag1b': ['valueofattr1', 'valueofattr2']}],
    \ 'childoftag1a':
    \ [ [], {'attrofchild': ['attrofchild']}],
    \ 'childoftag1b':
    \ [ ['childoftag1a'], {'attrofchild': []}],
    \ "vimxmltaginfo": {
    \ 'tag1': ['Menu info', 'Long information visible in preview window']},
    \ 'vimxmlattrinfo': {
    \ 'attrofchild': ['Menu info', 'Long information visible in preview window']}}

This example would be put in the "autoload/xml/crippled.vim" file and could
help to write this file: >

    <tag1 attroftag1b="valueofattr1">
        <childoftag1a attrofchild>
                &amp; &lt;
        </childoftag1a>
        <childoftag1b attrofchild="5">
            <childoftag1a>
                &gt; &apos; &quot;
            </childoftag1a>
        </childoftag1b>
    </tag1>

In the example four special elements are visible:

1. "vimxmlentities" - a special key with List containing entities of this XML
   dialect.
2. If the list containing possible values of attributes has one element and
   this element is equal to the name of the attribute this attribute will be
   treated as boolean and inserted as 'attrname' and not as 'attrname="'
3. "vimxmltaginfo" - a special key with a Dictionary containing tag
   names as keys and two element List as values, for additional menu info and
   the long description.
4. "vimxmlattrinfo" - special key with Dictionary containing attribute names
   as keys and two element List as values, for additional menu info and long
   description.

Note: Tag names in the data file MUST not contain a namespace description.
Check xsl.vim for an example.
Note: All data and functions are publicly available as global
variables/functions and can be used for personal editing functions.


DTD -> Vim							*dtd2vim*

On |www| is the script |dtd2vim| which parses DTD and creates an XML data file
for Vim XML omni completion.

    dtd2vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1462

Check the beginning of that file for usage details.
The script requires perl and:

    perlSGML: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/perlsgml


Commands

:XMLns {name} [{namespace}]					*:XMLns*

Vim has to know which data file should be used and with which namespace.  For
loading of the data file and connecting data with the proper namespace use
|:XMLns| command.  The first (obligatory) argument is the name of the data
(xhtml10s, xsl).  The second argument is the code of namespace (h, xsl).  When
used without a second argument the dialect will be used as default - without
namespace declaration.  For example to use XML completion in .xsl files: >

	:XMLns xhtml10s
	:XMLns xsl xsl


:XMLent {name}							*:XMLent*

By default entities will be completed from the data file of the default
namespace.  The XMLent command should be used in case when there is no default
namespace: >

	:XMLent xhtml10s

Usage

While used in this situation (after declarations from previous part, | is
cursor position): >

	<|

Will complete to an appropriate XHTML tag, and in this situation: >

	<xsl:|

Will complete to an appropriate XSL tag.


The script xmlcomplete.vim, provided through the |autoload| mechanism,
has the xmlcomplete#GetLastOpenTag() function which can be used in XML files
to get the name of the last open tag (b:unaryTagsStack has to be defined): >

	:echo xmlcomplete#GetLastOpenTag("b:unaryTagsStack")



==============================================================================
8. Insert mode commands					*inserting*

The following commands can be used to insert new text into the buffer.  They
can all be undone and repeated with the "." command.

							*a*
a			Append text after the cursor [count] times.  If the
			cursor is in the first column of an empty line Insert
			starts there.  But not when 'virtualedit' is set!

							*A*
A			Append text at the end of the line [count] times.

<insert>	or				*i* *insert* *<Insert>*
i			Insert text before the cursor [count] times.
			When using CTRL-O in Insert mode |i_CTRL-O| the count
			is not supported.

							*I*
I			Insert text before the first non-blank in the line
			[count] times.
			When the 'H' flag is present in 'cpoptions' and the
			line only contains blanks, insert start just before
			the last blank.

							*gI*
gI			Insert text in column 1 [count] times.  {not in Vi}

							*gi*
gi			Insert text in the same position as where Insert mode
			was stopped last time in the current buffer.
			This uses the |'^| mark.  It's different from "`^i"
			when the mark is past the end of the line.
			The position is corrected for inserted/deleted lines,
			but NOT for inserted/deleted characters.
			When the |:keepjumps| command modifier is used the |'^|
			mark won't be changed.
			{not in Vi}

							*o*
o			Begin a new line below the cursor and insert text,
			repeat [count] times.  {Vi: blank [count] screen
			lines}
			When the '#' flag is in 'cpoptions' the count is
			ignored.

							*O*
O			Begin a new line above the cursor and insert text,
			repeat [count] times.  {Vi: blank [count] screen
			lines}
			When the '#' flag is in 'cpoptions' the count is
			ignored.

These commands are used to start inserting text.  You can end insert mode with
<Esc>.  See |mode-ins-repl| for the other special characters in Insert mode.
The effect of [count] takes place after Insert mode is exited.

When 'autoindent' is on, the indent for a new line is obtained from the
previous line.  When 'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on, the indent for a line
is automatically adjusted for C programs.

'textwidth' can be set to the maximum width for a line.  When a line becomes
too long when appending characters a line break is automatically inserted.


==============================================================================
9. Ex insert commands					*inserting-ex*

							*:a* *:append*
:{range}a[ppend][!]	Insert several lines of text below the specified
			line.  If the {range} is missing, the text will be
			inserted after the current line.
			Adding [!] toggles 'autoindent' for the time this
			command is executed.

							*:i* *:in* *:insert*
:{range}i[nsert][!]	Insert several lines of text above the specified
			line.  If the {range} is missing, the text will be
			inserted before the current line.
			Adding [!] toggles 'autoindent' for the time this
			command is executed.

These two commands will keep on asking for lines, until you type a line
containing only a ".".  Watch out for lines starting with a backslash, see
|line-continuation|.

When in Ex mode (see |-e|) a backslash at the end of the line can be used to
insert a NUL character.  To be able to have a line ending in a backslash use
two backslashes.  This means that the number of backslashes is halved, but
only at the end of the line.

NOTE: These commands cannot be used with |:global| or |:vglobal|.
":append" and ":insert" don't work properly in between ":if" and
":endif", ":for" and ":endfor", ":while" and ":endwhile".

							*:start* *:startinsert*
:star[tinsert][!]	Start Insert mode just after executing this command.
			Works like typing "i" in Normal mode.  When the ! is
			included it works like "A", append to the line.
			Otherwise insertion starts at the cursor position.
			Note that when using this command in a function or
			script, the insertion only starts after the function
			or script is finished.
			This command does not work from |:normal|.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+ex_extra|
			feature}

							*:stopi* *:stopinsert*
:stopi[nsert]		Stop Insert mode as soon as possible.  Works like
			typing <Esc> in Insert mode.
			Can be used in an autocommand, example: >
				:au BufEnter scratch stopinsert
<
					*replacing-ex* *:startreplace*
:startr[eplace][!]	Start Replace mode just after executing this command.
			Works just like typing "R" in Normal mode.  When the
			! is included it acts just like "$R" had been typed
			(ie. begin replace mode at the end-of-line).  Other-
			wise replacement begins at the cursor position.
			Note that when using this command in a function or
			script that the replacement will only start after
			the function or script is finished.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+ex_extra|
			feature}

							*:startgreplace*
:startg[replace][!]	Just like |:startreplace|, but use Virtual Replace
			mode, like with |gR|.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+ex_extra|
			feature}

==============================================================================
10. Inserting a file					*inserting-file*

							*:r* *:re* *:read*
:r[ead] [++opt] [name]
			Insert the file [name] (default: current file) below
			the cursor.
			See |++opt| for the possible values of [++opt].

:{range}r[ead] [++opt] [name]
			Insert the file [name] (default: current file) below
			the specified line.
			See |++opt| for the possible values of [++opt].

							*:r!* *:read!*
:[range]r[ead] [++opt] !{cmd}
			Execute {cmd} and insert its standard output below
			the cursor or the specified line.  A temporary file is
			used to store the output of the command which is then
			read into the buffer.  'shellredir' is used to save
			the output of the command, which can be set to include
			stderr or not.  {cmd} is executed like with ":!{cmd}",
			any '!' is replaced with the previous command |:!|.
			See |++opt| for the possible values of [++opt].

These commands insert the contents of a file, or the output of a command,
into the buffer.  They can be undone.  They cannot be repeated with the "."
command.  They work on a line basis, insertion starts below the line in which
the cursor is, or below the specified line.  To insert text above the first
line use the command ":0r {name}".

After the ":read" command, the cursor is left on the first non-blank in the
first new line.  Unless in Ex mode, then the cursor is left on the last new
line (sorry, this is Vi compatible).

If a file name is given with ":r", it becomes the alternate file.  This can be
used, for example, when you want to edit that file instead: ":e! #".  This can
be switched off by removing the 'a' flag from the 'cpoptions' option.

Of the [++opt] arguments one is specifically for ":read", the ++edit argument.
This is useful when the ":read" command is actually used to read a file into
the buffer as if editing that file.  Use this command in an empty buffer: >
	:read ++edit filename
The effect is that the 'fileformat', 'fileencoding', 'bomb', etc. options are
set to what has been detected for "filename".  Note that a single empty line
remains, you may want to delete it.

							*file-read*
The 'fileformat' option sets the <EOL> style for a file:
'fileformat'    characters	   name				~
  "dos"		<CR><NL> or <NL>   DOS format
  "unix"	<NL>		   Unix format
  "mac"		<CR>		   Mac format
Previously 'textmode' was used.  It is obsolete now.

If 'fileformat' is "dos", a <CR> in front of an <NL> is ignored and a CTRL-Z
at the end of the file is ignored.

If 'fileformat' is "mac", a <NL> in the file is internally represented by a
<CR>.  This is to avoid confusion with a <NL> which is used to represent a
<NUL>.  See |CR-used-for-NL|.

If the 'fileformats' option is not empty Vim tries to recognize the type of
<EOL> (see |file-formats|).  However, the 'fileformat' option will not be
changed, the detected format is only used while reading the file.
A similar thing happens with 'fileencodings'.

On non-MS-DOS, Win32, and OS/2 systems the message "[dos format]" is shown if
a file is read in DOS format, to remind you that something unusual is done.
On Macintosh, MS-DOS, Win32, and OS/2 the message "[unix format]" is shown if
a file is read in Unix format.
On non-Macintosh systems, the message "[Mac format]" is shown if a file is
read in Mac format.

An example on how to use ":r !": >
	:r !uuencode binfile binfile
This command reads "binfile", uuencodes it and reads it into the current
buffer.  Useful when you are editing e-mail and want to include a binary
file.

							*read-messages*
When reading a file Vim will display a message with information about the read
file.  In the table is an explanation for some of the items.  The others are
self explanatory.  Using the long or the short version depends on the
'shortmess' option.

	long		short		meaning ~
	[readonly]	{RO}		the file is write protected
	[fifo/socket]			using a stream
	[fifo]				using a fifo stream
	[socket]			using a socket stream
	[CR missing]			reading with "dos" 'fileformat' and a
					NL without a preceding CR was found.
	[NL found]			reading with "mac" 'fileformat' and a
					NL was found (could be "unix" format)
	[long lines split]		at least one line was split in two
	[NOT converted]			conversion from 'fileencoding' to
					'encoding' was desired but not
					possible
	[converted]			conversion from 'fileencoding' to
					'encoding' done
	[crypted]			file was decrypted
	[READ ERRORS]			not all of the file could be read

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*intro*

Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so many
improvements that a name change was appropriate.  Vim is a text editor which
includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot of new
ones.  It is very useful for editing programs and other plain text.
   All commands are given with the keyboard.  This has the advantage that you
can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen.  For those
who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and
menus (see |gui.txt|).

An overview of this manual can be found in the file "help.txt", |help.txt|.
It can be accessed from within Vim with the <Help> or <F1> key and with the
|:help| command (just type ":help", without the bars or quotes).
   The 'helpfile' option can be set to the name of the help file, in case it
is not located in the default place.  You can jump to subjects like with tags:
Use CTRL-] to jump to a subject under the cursor, use CTRL-T to jump back.

Throughout this manual the differences between Vi and Vim are mentioned in
curly braces, like this: {Vi does not have on-line help}.  See |vi_diff.txt|
for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

This manual refers to Vim on various machines.  There may be small differences
between different computers and terminals.  Besides the remarks given in this
document, there is a separate document for each supported system, see
|sys-file-list|.

							*pronounce*
Vim is pronounced as one word, like Jim, not vi-ai-em.  It's written with a
capital, since it's a name, again like Jim.

This manual is a reference for all the Vim commands and options.  This is not
an introduction to the use of Vi or Vim, it gets a bit complicated here and
there.  For beginners, there is a hands-on |tutor|.  To learn using Vim, read
the user manual |usr_toc.txt|.

							*book*
There are many books on Vi that contain a section for beginners.  There are
two books I can recommend:

	"Vim - Vi Improved" by Steve Oualline

This is the very first book completely dedicated to Vim.  It is very good for
beginners.  The most often used commands are explained with pictures and
examples.  The less often used commands are also explained, the more advanced
features are summarized.  There is a comprehensive index and a quick
reference.  Parts of this book have been included in the user manual
|frombook|.
Published by New Riders Publishing.  ISBN: 0735710015
For more information try one of these:
	http://iccf-holland.org/click5.html
	http://www.vim.org/iccf/click5.html

	"Learning the Vi editor" by Linda Lamb and Arnold Robbins

This is a book about Vi that includes a chapter on Vim (in the sixth edition).
The first steps in Vi are explained very well.  The commands that Vim adds are
only briefly mentioned.  There is also a German translation.
Published by O'Reilly.  ISBN: 1-56592-426-6.

==============================================================================
2. Vim on the internet					*internet*

			*www* *WWW*  *faq* *FAQ* *distribution* *download*
The Vim pages contain the most recent information about Vim.  They also
contain links to the most recent version of Vim.  The FAQ is a list of
Frequently Asked Questions.  Read this if you have problems.

Usenet News group where Vim is discussed:		*news* *usenet*
	comp.editors
This group is also for other editors.  If you write about Vim, don't forget to
mention that.

						*mail-list* *maillist*
There are several mailing lists for Vim:
<vim@vim.org>
	For discussions about using existing versions of Vim: Useful mappings,
	questions, answers, where to get a specific version, etc.  There are
	quite a few people watching this list and answering questions, also
	for beginners.  Don't hesitate to ask your question here.
<vim-dev@vim.org>				*vim-dev* *vimdev*
	For discussions about changing Vim: New features, porting, patches,
	beta-test versions, etc.
<vim-announce@vim.org>				*vim-announce*
	Announcements about new versions of Vim; also for beta-test versions
	and ports to different systems.  This is a read-only list.
<vim-multibyte@vim.org>				*vim-multibyte*
	For discussions about using and improving the multi-byte aspects of
	Vim.
<vim-mac@vim.org>				*vim-mac*
	For discussions about using and improving the Macintosh version of
	Vim.

See http://www.vim.org/maillist.php for the latest information.

NOTE:
- You can only send messages to these lists if you have subscribed!
- You need to send the messages from the same location as where you subscribed
  from (to avoid spam mail).
- Maximum message size is 40000 characters.

						*subscribe-maillist*
If you want to join, send a message to
	<vim-subscribe@vim.org>
Make sure that your "From:" address is correct.  Then the list server will
give you help on how to subscribe.

						*maillist-archive*
For more information and archives look on the Vim maillist page:
http://www.vim.org/maillist.php


Bug reports:				*bugs* *bug-reports* *bugreport.vim*

Send bug reports to: Vim Developers <vim_dev@vim.org>
This is a maillist, you need to become a member first and many people will see
the message.  If you don't want that, e.g. because it is a security issue,
send it to <bugs@vim.org>, this only goes to the Vim maintainer (that's Bram).

Please be brief; all the time that is spent on answering mail is subtracted
from the time that is spent on improving Vim!  Always give a reproducible
example and try to find out which settings or other things influence the
appearance of the bug.  Try different machines, if possible.  Send me patches
if you can!

It will help to include information about the version of Vim you are using and
your setup.  You can get the information with this command: >
   :so $VIMRUNTIME/bugreport.vim
This will create a file "bugreport.txt" in the current directory, with a lot
of information of your environment.  Before sending this out, check if it
doesn't contain any confidential information!

If Vim crashes, please try to find out where.  You can find help on this here:
|debug.txt|.

In case of doubt or when you wonder if the problem has already been fixed but
you can't find a fix for it, become a member of the vim-dev maillist and ask
your question there. |maillist|

							*year-2000* *Y2K*
Since Vim internally doesn't use dates for editing, there is no year 2000
problem to worry about.  Vim does use the time in the form of seconds since
January 1st 1970.  It is used for a time-stamp check of the edited file and
the swap file, which is not critical and should only cause warning messages.

There might be a year 2038 problem, when the seconds don't fit in a 32 bit int
anymore.  This depends on the compiler, libraries and operating system.
Specifically, time_t and the ctime() function are used.  And the time_t is
stored in four bytes in the swap file.  But that's only used for printing a
file date/time for recovery, it will never affect normal editing.

The Vim strftime() function directly uses the strftime() system function.
localtime() uses the time() system function.  getftime() uses the time
returned by the stat() system function.  If your system libraries are year
2000 compliant, Vim is too.

The user may create scripts for Vim that use external commands.  These might
introduce Y2K problems, but those are not really part of Vim itself.

*love* *peace* *friendship* *gross-national-happiness*


In this documentation there are several references to other versions of Vi:
							*Vi* *vi*
Vi	"the original".  Without further remarks this is the version
	of Vi that appeared in Sun OS 4.x.  ":version" returns
	"Version 3.7, 6/7/85".  Sometimes other versions are referred
	to.  Only runs under Unix.  Source code only available with a
	license.  More information on Vi can be found through:
		http://vi-editor.org	[doesn't currently work...]
							*Posix*
Posix	From the IEEE standard 1003.2, Part 2: Shell and utilities.
	Generally known as "Posix".  This is a textual description of
	how Vi is supposed to work.
	See |posix-compliance|.
							*Nvi*
Nvi	The "New" Vi.  The version of Vi that comes with BSD 4.4 and FreeBSD.
	Very good compatibility with the original Vi, with a few extensions.
	The version used is 1.79.  ":version" returns "Version 1.79
	(10/23/96)".  There has been no release the last few years, although
	there is a development version 1.81.
	Source code is freely available.
							*Elvis*
Elvis	Another Vi clone, made by Steve Kirkendall.  Very compact but isn't
	as flexible as Vim.
	The version used is 2.1.  It is still being developed.  Source code is
	freely available.

==============================================================================
4. Notation						*notation*

When syntax highlighting is used to read this, text that is not typed
literally is often highlighted with the Special group.  These are items in [],
{} and <>, and CTRL-X.

Note that Vim uses all possible characters in commands.  Sometimes the [], {}
and <> are part of what you type, the context should make this clear.


[]		Characters in square brackets are optional.

						    *count* *[count]*
[count]		An optional number that may precede the command to multiply
		or iterate the command.  If no number is given, a count of one
		is used, unless otherwise noted.  Note that in this manual the
		[count] is not mentioned in the description of the command,
		but only in the explanation.  This was done to make the
		commands easier to look up.  If the 'showcmd' option is on,
		the (partially) entered count is shown at the bottom of the
		window.  You can use <Del> to erase the last digit (|N<Del>|).

							*[quotex]*
["x]		An optional register designation where text can be stored.
		See |registers|.  The x is a single character between 'a' and
		'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"', and in some cases (with the put
		command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#', or others.  The
		uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register,
		but the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous
		register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to
		append to the previous register contents.  Without the ""x" or
		with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.

							*{}*
{}		Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear,
		but which can take a number of different values.  The
		differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces
		(this will be clear from the context).

							*{char1-char2}*
{char1-char2}	A single character from the range char1 to char2.  For
		example: {a-z} is a lowercase letter.  Multiple ranges may be
		concatenated.  For example, {a-zA-Z0-9} is any alphanumeric
		character.

						*{motion}* *movement*
{motion}	A command that moves the cursor.  These are explained in
		|motion.txt|.  Examples:
			w		to start of next word
			b		to begin of current word
			4j		four lines down
			/The<CR>	to next occurrence of "The"
		This is used after an |operator| command to move over the text
		that is to be operated upon.
		- If the motion includes a count and the operator also has a
		  count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w"
		  deletes six words.
		- The motion can be backwards, e.g. "db" to delete to the
		  start of the word.
		- The motion can also be a mouse click.  The mouse is not
		  supported in every terminal though.
		- The ":omap" command can be used to map characters while an
		  operator is pending.
		- Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.  This can be
		  used to call a function that does some complicated motion.
		  The motion is always characterwise exclusive, no matter
		  what ":" command is used.  This means it's impossible to
		  include the last character of a line without the line break
		  (unless 'virtualedit' is set).
		  If the Ex command changes the text before where the operator
		  starts or jumps to another buffer the result is
		  unpredictable.  It is possible to change the text further
		  down.  Jumping to another buffer is possible if the current
		  buffer is not unloaded.

							*{Visual}*
{Visual}	A selected text area.  It is started with the "v", "V", or
		CTRL-V command, then any cursor movement command can be used
		to change the end of the selected text.
		This is used before an |operator| command to highlight the
		text that is to be operated upon.
		See |Visual-mode|.

							*<character>*
<character>	A special character from the table below, optionally with
		modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.

							*'character'*
'c'		A single ASCII character.

							*CTRL-{char}*
CTRL-{char}	{char} typed as a control character; that is, typing {char}
		while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of {char} does not
		matter; thus CTRL-A and CTRL-a are equivalent.  But on some
		terminals, using the SHIFT key will produce another code,
		don't use it then.

							*'option'*
'option'	An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is
		enclosed in single quotes.  See |options|.

							*quotecommandquote*
"command"	A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in
		double quotes.
`command`	New style command, this distinguishes it from other quoted
		text and strings.

					*key-notation* *key-codes* *keycodes*
These names for keys are used in the documentation.  They can also be used
with the ":map" command (insert the key name by pressing CTRL-K and then the
key you want the name for).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The shifted cursor keys, the help key, and the undo key are only
available on a few terminals.  On the Amiga, shifted function key 10 produces
a code (CSI) that is also used by key sequences.  It will be recognized only
after typing another key.

Note: There are two codes for the delete key.  127 is the decimal ASCII value
for the delete key, which is always recognized.  Some delete keys send another
value, in which case this value is obtained from the termcap entry "kD".  Both
values have the same effect.  Also see |:fixdel|.

Note: The keypad keys are used in the same way as the corresponding "normal"
keys.  For example, <kHome> has the same effect as <Home>.  If a keypad key
sends the same raw key code as its non-keypad equivalent, it will be
recognized as the non-keypad code.  For example, when <kHome> sends the same
code as <Home>, when pressing <kHome> Vim will think <Home> was pressed.
Mapping <kHome> will not work then.

								*<>*
Examples are often given in the <> notation.  Sometimes this is just to make
clear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with
the ":map" command.  The rules are:
 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and '<'
 2.  A backslash is represented with "\\", double backslash, or "<Bslash>".
 3.  A real '<' is represented with "\<" or "<lt>".  When there is no
     confusion possible, a '<' can be used directly.
 4.  "<key>" means the special key typed.  This is the notation explained in
     the table above.  A few examples:
	   <Esc>		Escape key
	   <C-G>		CTRL-G
	   <Up>			cursor up key
	   <C-LeftMouse>	Control- left mouse click
	   <S-F11>		Shifted function key 11
	   <M-a>		Meta- a  ('a' with bit 8 set)
	   <M-A>		Meta- A  ('A' with bit 8 set)
	   <t_kd>		"kd" termcap entry (cursor down key)

If you want to use the full <> notation in Vim, you have to make sure the '<'
flag is excluded from 'cpoptions' (when 'compatible' is not set, it already is
by default). >
	:set cpo-=<
The <> notation uses <lt> to escape the special meaning of key names.  Using a
backslash also works, but only when 'cpoptions' does not include the 'B' flag.

Examples for mapping CTRL-H to the six characters "<Home>": >
	:imap <C-H> \<Home>
	:imap <C-H> <lt>Home>
The first one only works when the 'B' flag is not in 'cpoptions'.  The second
one always works.
To get a literal "<lt>" in a mapping: >
	:map <C-L> <lt>lt>

For mapping, abbreviation and menu commands you can then copy-paste the
examples and use them directly.  Or type them literally, including the '<' and
'>' characters.  This does NOT work for other commands, like ":set" and
":autocmd"!

==============================================================================
5. Modes, introduction				*vim-modes-intro* *vim-modes*

Vim has six BASIC modes:

					*Normal* *Normal-mode* *command-mode*
Normal mode		In Normal mode you can enter all the normal editor
			commands.  If you start the editor you are in this
			mode (unless you have set the 'insertmode' option,
			see below).  This is also known as command mode.

Visual mode		This is like Normal mode, but the movement commands
			extend a highlighted area.  When a non-movement
			command is used, it is executed for the highlighted
			area.  See |Visual-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VISUAL --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Select mode		This looks most like the MS-Windows selection mode.
			Typing a printable character deletes the selection
			and starts Insert mode.  See |Select-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- SELECT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Insert mode		In Insert mode the text you type is inserted into the
			buffer.  See |Insert-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- INSERT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Command-line mode	In Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) you
Cmdline mode		can enter one line of text at the bottom of the
			window.  This is for the Ex commands, ":", the pattern
			search commands, "?" and "/", and the filter command,
			"!".  |Cmdline-mode|

Ex mode			Like Command-line mode, but after entering a command
			you remain in Ex mode.  Very limited editing of the
			command line.  |Ex-mode|

There are six ADDITIONAL modes.  These are variants of the BASIC modes:

				*Operator-pending* *Operator-pending-mode*
Operator-pending mode	This is like Normal mode, but after an operator
			command has started, and Vim is waiting for a {motion}
			to specify the text that the operator will work on.

Replace mode		Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode.  You
			can do the same things as in Insert mode, but for
			each character you enter, one character of the existing
			text is deleted.  See |Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- REPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Virtual Replace mode	Virtual Replace mode is similar to Replace mode, but
			instead of file characters you are replacing screen
			real estate.  See |Virtual-Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VREPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Normal mode	Entered when CTRL-O given in Insert mode.  This is
			like Normal mode, but after executing one command Vim
			returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Visual mode	Entered when starting a Visual selection from Insert
			mode, e.g., by using CTRL-O and then "v", "V" or
			CTRL-V.  When the Visual selection ends, Vim returns
			to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) VISUAL --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Select mode	Entered when starting Select mode from Insert mode.
			E.g., by dragging the mouse or <S-Right>.
			When the Select mode ends, Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) SELECT --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

==============================================================================
6. Switching from mode to mode				*mode-switching*

If for any reason you do not know which mode you are in, you can always get
back to Normal mode by typing <Esc> twice.  This doesn't work for Ex mode
though, use ":visual".
You will know you are back in Normal mode when you see the screen flash or
hear the bell after you type <Esc>.  However, when pressing <Esc> after using
CTRL-O in Insert mode you get a beep but you are still in Insert mode, type
<Esc> again.

							*i_esc*
		TO mode						    ~
		Normal	Visual	Select	Insert	  Replace   Cmd-line  Ex ~
FROM mode								 ~
Normal			v V ^V	  *4	 *1	   R gR     : / ? !   Q
Visual		 *2		  ^G	 c C	    --	      :       --
Select		 *5	^O ^G		 *6	    --	      --      --
Insert		 <Esc>	  --	  --		  <Insert>    --      --
Replace		 <Esc>	  --	  --	<Insert>	      --      --
Command-line	 *3	  --	  --	 :start	    --		      --
Ex		 :vi	  --	  --	 --	    --	      --

-- not possible

*1 Go from Normal mode to Insert mode by giving the command "i", "I", "a",
   "A", "o", "O", "c", "C", "s" or S".
*2 Go from Visual mode to Normal mode by giving a non-movement command, which
   causes the command to be executed, or by hitting <Esc> "v", "V" or "CTRL-V"
   (see |v_v|), which just stops Visual mode without side effects.
*3 Go from Command-line mode to Normal mode by:
   - Hitting <CR> or <NL>, which causes the entered command to be executed.
   - Deleting the complete line (e.g., with CTRL-U) and giving a final <BS>.
   - Hitting CTRL-C or <Esc>, which quits the command-line without executing
     the command.
   In the last case <Esc> may be the character defined with the 'wildchar'
   option, in which case it will start command-line completion.  You can
   ignore that and type <Esc> again.  {Vi: when hitting <Esc> the command-line
   is executed.  This is unexpected for most people; therefore it was changed
   in Vim.  But when the <Esc> is part of a mapping, the command-line is
   executed.  If you want the Vi behaviour also when typing <Esc>, use ":cmap
   ^V<Esc> ^V^M"}
*4 Go from Normal to Select mode by:
   - use the mouse to select text while 'selectmode' contains "mouse"
   - use a non-printable command to move the cursor while keeping the Shift
     key pressed, and the 'selectmode' option contains "key"
   - use "v", "V" or "CTRL-V" while 'selectmode' contains "cmd"
   - use "gh", "gH" or "g CTRL-H"  |g_CTRL-H|
*5 Go from Select mode to Normal mode by using a non-printable command to move
   the cursor, without keeping the Shift key pressed.
*6 Go from Select mode to Insert mode by typing a printable character.  The
   selection is deleted and the character is inserted.

If the 'insertmode' option is on, editing a file will start in Insert mode.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-N*
Additionally the command CTRL-\ CTRL-N or <C-\><C-N> can be used to go to
Normal mode from any other mode.  This can be used to make sure Vim is in
Normal mode, without causing a beep like <Esc> would.  However, this does not
work in Ex mode.  When used after a command that takes an argument, such as
|f| or |m|, the timeout set with 'ttimeoutlen' applies.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-G*
The command CTRL-\ CTRL-G or <C-\><C-G> can be used to go to Insert mode when
'insertmode' is set.  Otherwise it goes to Normal mode.  This can be used to
make sure Vim is in the mode indicated by 'insertmode', without knowing in
what mode Vim currently is.

				    *Q* *mode-Ex* *Ex-mode* *Ex* *EX* *E501*
Q			Switch to "Ex" mode.  This is a bit like typing ":"
			commands one after another, except:
			- You don't have to keep pressing ":".
			- The screen doesn't get updated after each command.
			- There is no normal command-line editing.
			- Mappings and abbreviations are not used.
			In fact, you are editing the lines with the "standard"
			line-input editing commands (<Del> or <BS> to erase,
			CTRL-U to kill the whole line).
			Vim will enter this mode by default if it's invoked as
			"ex" on the command-line.
			Use the ":vi" command |:visual| to exit "Ex" mode.
			Note: In older versions of Vim "Q" formatted text,
			that is now done with |gq|.  But if you use the
			|vimrc_example.vim| script "Q" works like "gq".

					*gQ*
gQ			Switch to "Ex" mode like with "Q", but really behave
			like typing ":" commands after another.  All command
			line editing, completion etc. is available.
			Use the ":vi" command |:visual| to exit "Ex" mode.
			{not in Vi}

==============================================================================
7. The window contents					*window-contents*

In Normal mode and Insert/Replace mode the screen window will show the current
contents of the buffer: What You See Is What You Get.  There are two
exceptions:
- When the 'cpoptions' option contains '$', and the change is within one line,
  the text is not directly deleted, but a '$' is put at the last deleted
  character.
- When inserting text in one window, other windows on the same text are not
  updated until the insert is finished.
{Vi: The screen is not always updated on slow terminals}

Lines longer than the window width will wrap, unless the 'wrap' option is off
(see below).  The 'linebreak' option can be set to wrap at a blank character.

If the window has room after the last line of the buffer, Vim will show '~' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|some line		|
	|last line		|
	|~			|
	|~			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '~' lines indicate that the end of the buffer was reached.

If the last line in a window doesn't fit, Vim will indicate this with a '@' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|@			|
	|@			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '@' lines indicate that there is a line that doesn't fit in the
window.

When the "lastline" flag is present in the 'display' option, you will not see
'@' characters at the left side of window.  If the last line doesn't fit
completely, only the part that fits is shown, and the last three characters of
the last line are replaced with "@@@", like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|a very long line that d|
	|oesn't fit in the wi@@@|
	+-----------------------+

If there is a single line that is too long to fit in the window, this is a
special situation.  Vim will show only part of the line, around where the
cursor is.  There are no special characters shown, so that you can edit all
parts of this line.
{Vi: gives an "internal error" on lines that do not fit in the window}

The '@' occasion in the 'highlight' option can be used to set special
highlighting for the '@' and '~' characters.  This makes it possible to
distinguish them from real characters in the buffer.

The 'showbreak' option contains the string to put in front of wrapped lines.

							*wrap-off*
If the 'wrap' option is off, long lines will not wrap.  Only the part that
fits on the screen is shown.  If the cursor is moved to a part of the line
that is not shown, the screen is scrolled horizontally.  The advantage of
this method is that columns are shown as they are and lines that cannot fit
on the screen can be edited.  The disadvantage is that you cannot see all the
characters of a line at once.  The 'sidescroll' option can be set to the
minimal number of columns to scroll.  {Vi: has no 'wrap' option}

All normal ASCII characters are displayed directly on the screen.  The <Tab>
is replaced with the number of spaces that it represents.  Other non-printing
characters are replaced with "^{char}", where {char} is the non-printing
character with 64 added.  Thus character 7 (bell) will be shown as "^G".
Characters between 127 and 160 are replaced with "~{char}", where {char} is
the character with 64 subtracted.  These characters occupy more than one
position on the screen.  The cursor can only be positioned on the first one.

If you set the 'number' option, all lines will be preceded with their
number.  Tip: If you don't like wrapping lines to mix with the line numbers,
set the 'showbreak' option to eight spaces:
	":set showbreak=\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "

If you set the 'list' option, <Tab> characters will not be shown as several
spaces, but as "^I".  A '$' will be placed at the end of the line, so you can
find trailing blanks.

In Command-line mode only the command-line itself is shown correctly.  The
display of the buffer contents is updated as soon as you go back to Command
mode.

The last line of the window is used for status and other messages.  The
status messages will only be used if an option is on:

status message			option	     default	Unix default	~
current mode			'showmode'	on	    on
command characters		'showcmd'	on	    off
cursor position			'ruler'		off	    off

The current mode is "-- INSERT --" or "-- REPLACE --", see |'showmode'|.  The
command characters are those that you typed but were not used yet.  {Vi: does
not show the characters you typed or the cursor position}

If you have a slow terminal you can switch off the status messages to speed
up editing:
	:set nosc noru nosm

If there is an error, an error message will be shown for at least one second
(in reverse video).  {Vi: error messages may be overwritten with other
messages before you have a chance to read them}

Some commands show how many lines were affected.  Above which threshold this
happens can be controlled with the 'report' option (default 2).

On the Amiga Vim will run in a CLI window.  The name Vim and the full name of
the current file name will be shown in the title bar.  When the window is
resized, Vim will automatically redraw the window.  You may make the window as
small as you like, but if it gets too small not a single line will fit in it.
Make it at least 40 characters wide to be able to read most messages on the
last line.

On most Unix systems, resizing the window is recognized and handled correctly
by Vim.  {Vi: not ok}

==============================================================================
8. Definitions						*definitions*

  screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be
			a terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim
			window".
  window		A view on a buffer.

A screen contains one or more windows, separated by status lines and with the
command line at the bottom.

	+-------------------------------+
screen	| window 1	| window 2	|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|= status line =|= status line =|
	| window 3			|
	|				|
	|				|
	|==== status line ==============|
	|command line			|
	+-------------------------------+

The command line is also used for messages.  It scrolls up the screen when
there is not enough room in the command line.

A difference is made between four types of lines:

  buffer lines		The lines in the buffer.  This is the same as the
			lines as they are read from/written to a file.  They
			can be thousands of characters long.
  logical lines		The buffer lines with folding applied.  Buffer lines
			in a closed fold are changed to a single logical line:
			"+-- 99 lines folded".  They can be thousands of
			characters long.
  window lines		The lines displayed in a window: A range of logical
			lines with wrapping, line breaks, etc.  applied.  They
			can only be as long as the width of the window allows,
			longer lines are wrapped or truncated.
  screen lines		The lines of the screen that Vim uses.  Consists of
			the window lines of all windows, with status lines
			and the command line added.  They can only be as long
			as the width of the screen allows.  When the command
			line gets longer it wraps and lines are scrolled to
			make room.

1. Key mapping				*key-mapping* *mapping* *macro*

Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys.  The most common use
is to define a sequence commands for a function key.  Example: >

	:map <F2> a<C-R>=strftime("%c")<CR><Esc>

This appends the current date and time after the cursor (in <> notation |<>|).


1.1 MAP COMMANDS					*:map-commands*

There are commands to enter new mappings, remove mappings and list mappings.
See |map-overview| for the various forms of "map" and their relationships with
modes.

{lhs}	means left-hand-side	*{lhs}*
{rhs}	means right-hand-side	*{rhs}*

:map	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|		*:map*
:nm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|		*:nm* *:nmap*
:vm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-v|		*:vm* *:vmap*
:xm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-x|		*:xm* *:xmap*
:smap	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-s|		    *:smap*
:om[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-o|		*:om* *:omap*

:lm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|		*:lm* *:lmap*
:cm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|		*:cm* *:cmap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  The result, including
			{rhs}, is then further scanned for mappings.  This
			allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.

						*:nore* *:norem*
:no[remap]  {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|	*:no*  *:noremap* *:nor*
:nn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|	*:nn*  *:nnoremap*

:ln[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|	*:ln*  *:lnoremap*
:cno[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|	*:cno* *:cnoremap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  Disallow mapping of
			{rhs}, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.  Often
			used to redefine a command.  {not in Vi}

:lu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-l|		*:lu*   *:lunmap*
:cu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-c|		*:cu*   *:cunmap*
			Remove the mapping of {lhs} for the modes where the
			map command applies.  The mapping may remain defined
			for other modes where it applies.
			Note: Trailing spaces are included in the {lhs}.  This
			unmap does NOT work: >

:lmapc[lear]			|mapmode-l|		*:lmapc*  *:lmapclear*
:cmapc[lear]			|mapmode-c|		*:cmapc*  *:cmapclear*
			Remove ALL mappings for the modes where the map
			command applies.  {not in Vi}
			Use the <buffer> argument to remove buffer-local

:cm[ap] {lhs}			|mapmode-c|		*:cmap_l*
			List the key mappings for the key sequences starting
			with {lhs} in the modes where the map command applies.
			{not in Vi}

These commands are used to map a key or key sequence to a string of
characters.  You can use this to put command sequences under function keys,
translate one key into another, etc.  See |:mkexrc| for how to save and
restore the current mappings.

							*map-ambiguous*
When two mappings start with the same sequence of characters, they are
ambiguous.  Example: >
	:imap aa foo
	:imap aaa bar
When Vim has read "aa", it will need to get another character to be able to
decide if "aa" or "aaa" should be mapped.  This means that after typing "aa"
that mapping won't get expanded yet, Vim is waiting for another character.
If you type a space, then "foo" will get inserted, plus the space.  If you
type "a", then "bar" will get inserted.
{Vi does not allow ambiguous mappings}


1.2 SPECIAL ARGUMENTS					*:map-arguments*

"<buffer>", "<nowait>", "<silent>", "<special>", "<script>", "<expr>" and
"<unique>" can be used in any order.  They must appear right after the
command, before any other arguments.

				*:map-local* *:map-<buffer>* *E224* *E225*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<buffer>" the mapping will
be effective in the current buffer only.  Example: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
Then you can map ",w" to something else in another buffer: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
The local buffer mappings are used before the global ones.  See <nowait> below
to make a short local mapping not taking effect when a longer global one
exists.
The "<buffer>" argument can also be used to clear mappings: >
	:unmap <buffer> ,w
	:mapclear <buffer>
Local mappings are also cleared when a buffer is deleted, but not when it is
unloaded.  Just like local option values.
Also see |map-precedence|.

						*:map-<nowait>* *:map-nowait*
When defining a buffer-local mapping for "," there may be a global mapping
that starts with ",".  Then you need to type another character for Vim to know
whether to use the "," mapping or the longer one.  To avoid this add the
<nowait> argument.  Then the mapping will be used when it matches, Vim does
not wait for more characters to be typed.  However, if the characters were
already type they are used.

						*:map-<silent>* *:map-silent*
To define a mapping which will not be echoed on the command line, add
"<silent>" as the first argument.  Example: >
	:map <silent> ,h /Header<CR>
The search string will not be echoed when using this mapping.  Messages from
the executed command are still given though.  To shut them up too, add a
":silent" in the executed command: >
	:map <silent> ,h :exe ":silent normal /Header\r"<CR>
Prompts will still be given, e.g., for inputdialog().
Using "<silent>" for an abbreviation is possible, but will cause redrawing of
the command line to fail.

						*:map-<special>* *:map-special*
Define a mapping with <> notation for special keys, even though the "<" flag
may appear in 'cpoptions'.  This is useful if the side effect of setting
'cpoptions' is not desired.  Example: >
	:map <special> <F12> /Header<CR>
<
						*:map-<script>* *:map-script*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<script>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the mapping will only remap characters
in the {rhs} using mappings that were defined local to a script, starting with
"<SID>".  This can be used to avoid that mappings from outside a script
interfere (e.g., when CTRL-V is remapped in mswin.vim), but do use other
mappings defined in the script.
Note: ":map <script>" and ":noremap <script>" do the same thing.  The
"<script>" overrules the command name.  Using ":noremap <script>" is
preferred, because it's clearer that remapping is (mostly) disabled.

						*:map-<unique>* *E226* *E227*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<unique>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the command will fail if the mapping or
abbreviation already exists.  Example: >
	:map <unique> ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
When defining a local mapping, there will also be a check if a global map
already exists which is equal.
Example of what will fail: >
	:map ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
	:map <buffer> <unique> ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
If you want to map a key and then have it do what it was originally mapped to,
have a look at |maparg()|.

						*:map-<expr>* *:map-expression*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<expr>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the argument is an expression.  The
expression is evaluated to obtain the {rhs} that is used.  Example: >
	:inoremap <expr> . InsertDot()
The result of the InsertDot() function will be inserted.  It could check the
text before the cursor and start omni completion when some condition is met.

For abbreviations |v:char| is set to the character that was typed to trigger
the abbreviation.  You can use this to decide how to expand the {lhs}.  You
should not either insert or change the v:char.

Be very careful about side effects!  The expression is evaluated while
obtaining characters, you may very well make the command dysfunctional.
For this reason the following is blocked:
- Changing the buffer text |textlock|.
- Editing another buffer.
- The |:normal| command.
- Moving the cursor is allowed, but it is restored afterwards.
If you want the mapping to do any of these let the returned characters do
that.

You can use getchar(), it consumes typeahead if there is any. E.g., if you
have these mappings: >
  inoremap <expr> <C-L> nr2char(getchar())
  inoremap <expr> <C-L>x "foo"
If you now type CTRL-L nothing happens yet, Vim needs the next character to
decide what mapping to use.  If you type 'x' the second mapping is used and
"foo" is inserted.  If you type any other key the first mapping is used,
getchar() gets the typed key and returns it.

Here is an example that inserts a list number that increases: >
	let counter = 0
	inoremap <expr> <C-L> ListItem()
	inoremap <expr> <C-R> ListReset()

	func ListItem()
	  let g:counter += 1
	  return g:counter . '. '
	endfunc

	func ListReset()
	  let g:counter = 0
	  return ''
	endfunc

CTRL-L inserts the next number, CTRL-R resets the count.  CTRL-R returns an
empty string, so that nothing is inserted.

Note that there are some tricks to make special keys work and escape CSI bytes
in the text.  The |:map| command also does this, thus you must avoid that it
is done twice.  This does not work: >
	:imap <expr> <F3> "<Char-0x611B>"
Because the <Char- sequence is escaped for being a |:imap| argument and then
again for using <expr>.  This does work: >
	:imap <expr> <F3> "\u611B"
Using 0x80 as a single byte before other text does not work, it will be seen
as a special key.


1.3 MAPPING AND MODES					*:map-modes*
			*mapmode-nvo* *mapmode-n* *mapmode-v* *mapmode-o*

There are six sets of mappings
- For Normal mode: When typing commands.
- For Visual mode: When typing commands while the Visual area is highlighted.
- For Select mode: like Visual mode but typing text replaces the selection.
- For Operator-pending mode: When an operator is pending (after "d", "y", "c",
  etc.).  See below: |omap-info|.
- For Insert mode.  These are also used in Replace mode.
- For Command-line mode: When entering a ":" or "/" command.

Special case: While typing a count for a command in Normal mode, mapping zero
is disabled.  This makes it possible to map zero without making it impossible
to type a count with a zero.

						*map-overview* *map-modes*
Overview of which map command works in which mode.  More details below.
     COMMANDS                    MODES ~
:map   :noremap  :unmap     Normal, Visual, Select, Operator-pending
:nmap  :nnoremap :nunmap    Normal
:vmap  :vnoremap :vunmap    Visual and Select
:smap  :snoremap :sunmap    Select
:xmap  :xnoremap :xunmap    Visual
:omap  :onoremap :ounmap    Operator-pending
:map!  :noremap! :unmap!    Insert and Command-line
:imap  :inoremap :iunmap    Insert
:lmap  :lnoremap :lunmap    Insert, Command-line, Lang-Arg
:cmap  :cnoremap :cunmap    Command-line


    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
				       Normal  Visual+Select  Operator-pending ~
:map   :noremap   :unmap   :mapclear	 yes	    yes		   yes
:nmap  :nnoremap  :nunmap  :nmapclear	 yes	     -		    -
:vmap  :vnoremap  :vunmap  :vmapclear	  -	    yes		    -
:omap  :onoremap  :ounmap  :omapclear	  -	     -		   yes

:nunmap can also be used outside of a monastery.
						*mapmode-x* *mapmode-s*
Some commands work both in Visual and Select mode, some in only one.  Note
that quite often "Visual" is mentioned where both Visual and Select mode
apply. |Select-mode-mapping|
NOTE: Mapping a printable character in Select mode may confuse the user.  It's
better to explicitly use :xmap and :smap for printable characters.  Or use
:sunmap after defining the mapping.

    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
					  Visual    Select ~
:vmap  :vnoremap  :vunmap  :vmapclear	    yes      yes
:xmap  :xnoremap  :xunmap  :xmapclear	    yes       -
:smap  :snoremap  :sunmap  :smapclear	    -	     yes

			*mapmode-ic* *mapmode-i* *mapmode-c* *mapmode-l*
Some commands work both in Insert mode and Command-line mode, some not:

    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
					  Insert  Command-line	Lang-Arg ~
:map!  :noremap!  :unmap!  :mapclear!	    yes	       yes	   -
:imap  :inoremap  :iunmap  :imapclear	    yes		-	   -
:cmap  :cnoremap  :cunmap  :cmapclear	     -	       yes	   -
:lmap  :lnoremap  :lunmap  :lmapclear	    yes*       yes*	  yes*

The original Vi did not have separate mappings for
Normal/Visual/Operator-pending mode and for Insert/Command-line mode.
Therefore the ":map" and ":map!" commands enter and display mappings for
several modes.  In Vim you can use the ":nmap", ":vmap", ":omap", ":cmap" and
":imap" commands to enter mappings for each mode separately.

							*omap-info*
Operator-pending mappings can be used to define a movement command that can be
used with any operator.  Simple example: ":omap { w" makes "y{" work like "yw"
and "d{" like "dw".

To ignore the starting cursor position and select different text, you can have
the omap start Visual mode to select the text to be operated upon.  Example
that operates on a function name in the current line: >
	onoremap <silent> F :<C-U>normal! 0f(hviw<CR>
The CTRL-U (<C-U>) is used to remove the range that Vim may insert.  The
Normal mode commands find the first '(' character and select the first word
before it.  That usually is the function name.

To enter a mapping for Normal and Visual mode, but not Operator-pending mode,
first define it for all three modes, then unmap it for Operator-pending mode:
	:map    xx something-difficult
	:ounmap xx
Likewise for a mapping for Visual and Operator-pending mode or Normal and
Operator-pending mode.

						*language-mapping*
":lmap" defines a mapping that applies to:
- Insert mode
- Command-line mode
- when entering a search pattern
- the argument of the commands that accept a text character, such as "r" and
  "f"
- for the input() line
Generally: Whenever a character is to be typed that is part of the text in the
buffer, not a Vim command character.  "Lang-Arg" isn't really another mode,
it's just used here for this situation.
   The simplest way to load a set of related language mappings is by using the
'keymap' option.  See |45.5|.
   In Insert mode and in Command-line mode the mappings can be disabled with
the CTRL-^ command |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|. These commands change the value of
the 'iminsert' option.  When starting to enter a normal command line (not a
search pattern) the mappings are disabled until a CTRL-^ is typed.  The state
last used is remembered for Insert mode and Search patterns separately.  The
state for Insert mode is also used when typing a character as an argument to
command like "f" or "t".
   Language mappings will never be applied to already mapped characters.  They
are only used for typed characters.  This assumes that the language mapping
was already done when typing the mapping.


1.4 LISTING MAPPINGS					*map-listing*

When listing mappings the characters in the first two columns are:

      CHAR	MODE	~
     <Space>	Normal, Visual, Select and Operator-pending
	n	Normal
	v	Visual and Select
	s	Select
	x	Visual
	o	Operator-pending
	!	Insert and Command-line
	i	Insert
	l	":lmap" mappings for Insert, Command-line and Lang-Arg
	c	Command-line

Just before the {rhs} a special character can appear:
	*	indicates that it is not remappable
	&	indicates that only script-local mappings are remappable
	@	indicates a buffer-local mapping

Everything from the first non-blank after {lhs} up to the end of the line
(or '|') is considered to be part of {rhs}.  This allows the {rhs} to end
with a space.

Note: When using mappings for Visual mode, you can use the "'<" mark, which
is the start of the last selected Visual area in the current buffer |'<|.

							*:map-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a key map will also display where it was
last defined.  Example: >

	:verbose map <C-W>*
	n  <C-W>*      * <C-W><C-S>*
		Last set from /home/abcd/.vimrc

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.


1.5 MAPPING SPECIAL KEYS				*:map-special-keys*

There are three ways to map a special key:
1. The Vi-compatible method: Map the key code.  Often this is a sequence that
   starts with <Esc>.  To enter a mapping like this you type ":map " and then
   you have to type CTRL-V before hitting the function key.  Note that when
   the key code for the key is in the termcap (the t_ options), it will
   automatically be translated into the internal code and become the second
   way of mapping (unless the 'k' flag is included in 'cpoptions').
2. The second method is to use the internal code for the function key.  To
   enter such a mapping type CTRL-K and then hit the function key, or use
   the form "#1", "#2", .. "#9", "#0", "<Up>", "<S-Down>", "<S-F7>", etc.
   (see table of keys |key-notation|, all keys from <Up> can be used).  The
   first ten function keys can be defined in two ways: Just the number, like
   "#2", and with "<F>", like "<F2>".  Both stand for function key 2.  "#0"
   refers to function key 10, defined with option 't_f10', which may be
   function key zero on some keyboards.  The <> form cannot be used when
   'cpoptions' includes the '<' flag.
3. Use the termcap entry, with the form <t_xx>, where "xx" is the name of the
   termcap entry.  Any string entry can be used.  For example: >
     :map <t_F3> G
<  Maps function key 13 to "G".  This does not work if 'cpoptions' includes
   the '<' flag.

The advantage of the second and third method is that the mapping will work on
different terminals without modification (the function key will be
translated into the same internal code or the actual key code, no matter what
terminal you are using.  The termcap must be correct for this to work, and you
must use the same mappings).

DETAIL: Vim first checks if a sequence from the keyboard is mapped.  If it
isn't the terminal key codes are tried (see |terminal-options|).  If a
terminal code is found it is replaced with the internal code.  Then the check
for a mapping is done again (so you can map an internal code to something
else).  What is written into the script file depends on what is recognized.
If the terminal key code was recognized as a mapping the key code itself is
written to the script file.  If it was recognized as a terminal code the
internal code is written to the script file.


1.6 SPECIAL CHARACTERS					*:map-special-chars*
							*map_backslash*
Note that only CTRL-V is mentioned here as a special character for mappings
and abbreviations.  When 'cpoptions' does not contain 'B', a backslash can
also be used like CTRL-V.  The <> notation can be fully used then |<>|.  But
you cannot use "<C-V>" like CTRL-V to escape the special meaning of what
follows.

To map a backslash, or use a backslash literally in the {rhs}, the special
sequence "<Bslash>" can be used.  This avoids the need to double backslashes
when using nested mappings.

							*map_CTRL-C*
Using CTRL-C in the {lhs} is possible, but it will only work when Vim is
waiting for a key, not when Vim is busy with something.  When Vim is busy
CTRL-C interrupts/breaks the command.
When using the GUI version on MS-Windows CTRL-C can be mapped to allow a Copy
command to the clipboard.  Use CTRL-Break to interrupt Vim.

							*map_space_in_lhs*
To include a space in {lhs} precede it with a CTRL-V (type two CTRL-Vs for
each space).
							*map_space_in_rhs*
If you want a {rhs} that starts with a space, use "<Space>".  To be fully Vi
compatible (but unreadable) don't use the |<>| notation, precede {rhs} with a
single CTRL-V (you have to type CTRL-V two times).
							*map_empty_rhs*
You can create an empty {rhs} by typing nothing after a single CTRL-V (you
have to type CTRL-V two times).  Unfortunately, you cannot do this in a vimrc
file.
							*<Nop>*
An easier way to get a mapping that doesn't produce anything, is to use
"<Nop>" for the {rhs}.  This only works when the |<>| notation is enabled.
For example, to make sure that function key 8 does nothing at all: >
	:map  <F8>  <Nop>
	:map! <F8>  <Nop>
<
							*map-multibyte*
It is possible to map multibyte characters, but only the whole character.  You
cannot map the first byte only.  This was done to prevent problems in this
scenario: >
	:set encoding=latin1
	:imap <M-C> foo
	:set encoding=utf-8
The mapping for <M-C> is defined with the latin1 encoding, resulting in a 0xc3
byte.  If you type the character  (0xe1 <M-a>) in UTF-8 encoding this is the
two bytes 0xc3 0xa1.  You don't want the 0xc3 byte to be mapped then or
otherwise it would be impossible to type the  character.

					*<Leader>* *mapleader*
To define a mapping which uses the "mapleader" variable, the special string
"<Leader>" can be used.  It is replaced with the string value of "mapleader".
If "mapleader" is not set or empty, a backslash is used instead.  Example: >
	:map <Leader>A  oanother line<Esc>
Works like: >
	:map \A  oanother line<Esc>
But after: >
	:let mapleader = ","
It works like: >
	:map ,A  oanother line<Esc>

Note that the value of "mapleader" is used at the moment the mapping is
defined.  Changing "mapleader" after that has no effect for already defined
mappings.

					*<LocalLeader>* *maplocalleader*
<LocalLeader> is just like <Leader>, except that it uses "maplocalleader"
instead of "mapleader".  <LocalLeader> is to be used for mappings which are
local to a buffer.  Example: >
      :map <buffer> <LocalLeader>A  oanother line<Esc>
<
In a global plugin <Leader> should be used and in a filetype plugin
<LocalLeader>.  "mapleader" and "maplocalleader" can be equal.  Although, if
you make them different, there is a smaller chance of mappings from global
plugins to clash with mappings for filetype plugins.  For example, you could
keep "mapleader" at the default backslash, and set "maplocalleader" to an
underscore.

							*map-<SID>*
In a script the special key name "<SID>" can be used to define a mapping
that's local to the script.  See |<SID>| for details.

							*<Plug>*
The special key name "<Plug>" can be used for an internal mapping, which is
not to be matched with any key sequence.  This is useful in plugins
|using-<Plug>|.

							*<Char>* *<Char->*
To map a character by its decimal, octal or hexadecimal number the <Char>
construct can be used:
	<Char-123>	character 123
	<Char-033>	character 27
	<Char-0x7f>	character 127
	<S-Char-114>    character 114 ('r') shifted ('R')
This is useful to specify a (multi-byte) character in a 'keymap' file.
Upper and lowercase differences are ignored.

							*map-comments*
It is not possible to put a comment after these commands, because the '"'
character is considered to be part of the {lhs} or {rhs}.

							*map_bar*
Since the '|' character is used to separate a map command from the next
command, you will have to do something special to include  a '|' in {rhs}.
There are three methods:
   use	     works when			   example	~
   <Bar>     '<' is not in 'cpoptions'	   :map _l :!ls <Bar> more^M
   \|	     'b' is not in 'cpoptions'	   :map _l :!ls \| more^M
   ^V|	     always, in Vim and Vi	   :map _l :!ls ^V| more^M

(here ^V stands for CTRL-V; to get one CTRL-V you have to type it twice; you
cannot use the <> notation "<C-V>" here).

All three work when you use the default setting for 'cpoptions'.

When 'b' is present in 'cpoptions', "\|" will be recognized as a mapping
ending in a '\' and then another command.  This is Vi compatible, but
illogical when compared to other commands.

							*map_return*
When you have a mapping that contains an Ex command, you need to put a line
terminator after it to have it executed.  The use of <CR> is recommended for
this (see |<>|).  Example: >
   :map  _ls  :!ls -l %:S<CR>:echo "the end"<CR>

To avoid mapping of the characters you type in insert or Command-line mode,
type a CTRL-V first.  The mapping in Insert mode is disabled if the 'paste'
option is on.
							*map-error*
Note that when an error is encountered (that causes an error message or beep)
the rest of the mapping is not executed.  This is Vi-compatible.

Note that the second character (argument) of the commands @zZtTfF[]rm'`"v
and CTRL-X is not mapped.  This was done to be able to use all the named
registers and marks, even when the command with the same name has been
mapped.


1.7 WHAT KEYS TO MAP					*map-which-keys*

If you are going to map something, you will need to choose which key(s) to use
for the {lhs}.  You will have to avoid keys that are used for Vim commands,
otherwise you would not be able to use those commands anymore.  Here are a few
suggestions:
- Function keys <F2>, <F3>, etc..  Also the shifted function keys <S-F1>,
  <S-F2>, etc.  Note that <F1> is already used for the help command.
- Meta-keys (with the ALT key pressed).  Depending on your keyboard accented
  characters may be used as well. |:map-alt-keys|
- Use the '_' or ',' character and then any other character.  The "_" and ","
  commands do exist in Vim (see |_| and |,|), but you probably never use them.
- Use a key that is a synonym for another command.  For example: CTRL-P and
  CTRL-N.  Use an extra character to allow more mappings.
- The key defined by <Leader> and one or more other keys.  This is especially
  useful in scripts. |mapleader|

See the file "index" for keys that are not used and thus can be mapped without
losing any builtin function.  You can also use ":help {key}^D" to find out if
a key is used for some command.  ({key} is the specific key you want to find
out about, ^D is CTRL-D).


1.8 EXAMPLES						*map-examples*

A few examples (given as you type them, for "<CR>" you type four characters;
the '<' flag must not be present in 'cpoptions' for this to work). >

   :map <F3>  o#include
   :map <M-g> /foo<CR>cwbar<Esc>
   :map _x    d/END/e<CR>
   :map! qq   quadrillion questions


Multiplying a count

When you type a count before triggering a mapping, it's like the count was
typed before the {lhs}.  For example, with this mapping: >
   :map <F4>  3w
Typing 2<F4> will result in "23w". Thus not moving 2 * 3 words but 23 words.
If you want to multiply counts use the expression register: >
   :map <F4>  @='3w'<CR>
The part between quotes is the expression being executed. |@=|


1.9 USING MAPPINGS					*map-typing*

Vim will compare what you type with the start of a mapped sequence.  If there
is an incomplete match, it will get more characters until there either is a
complete match or until there is no match at all.  Example: If you map! "qq",
the first 'q' will not appear on the screen until you type another
character.  This is because Vim cannot know if the next character will be a
'q' or not.  If the 'timeout' option is on (which is the default) Vim will
only wait for one second (or as long as specified with the 'timeoutlen'
option).  After that it assumes that the 'q' is to be interpreted as such.  If
you type slowly, or your system is slow, reset the 'timeout' option.  Then you
might want to set the 'ttimeout' option.

                            				*map-precedence*
Buffer-local mappings (defined using |:map-<buffer>|) take precedence over
global mappings.  When a buffer-local mapping is the same as a global mapping,
Vim will use the buffer-local mapping.  In addition, Vim will use a complete
mapping immediately if it was defined with <nowait>, even if a longer mapping
has the same prefix.  For example, given the following two mappings: >
    :map <buffer> <nowait> \a   :echo "Local \a"<CR>
    :map                   \abc :echo "Global \abc"<CR>
When typing \a the buffer-local mapping will be used immediately.  Vim will
not wait for more characters to see if the user might be typing \abc.

							*map-keys-fails*
There are situations where key codes might not be recognized:
- Vim can only read part of the key code.  Mostly this is only the first
  character.  This happens on some Unix versions in an xterm.
- The key code is after character(s) that are mapped.  E.g., "<F1><F1>" or
  "g<F1>".

The result is that the key code is not recognized in this situation, and the
mapping fails.  There are two actions needed to avoid this problem:

- Remove the 'K' flag from 'cpoptions'.  This will make Vim wait for the rest
  of the characters of the function key.
- When using <F1> to <F4> the actual key code generated may correspond to
  <xF1> to <xF4>.  There are mappings from <xF1> to <F1>, <xF2> to <F2>, etc.,
  but these are not recognized after another half a mapping.  Make sure the
  key codes for <F1> to <F4> are correct: >
	:set <F1>=<type CTRL-V><type F1>
< Type the <F1> as four characters.  The part after the "=" must be done with
  the actual keys, not the literal text.
Another solution is to use the actual key code in the mapping for the second
special key: >
	:map <F1><Esc>OP :echo "yes"<CR>
Don't type a real <Esc>, Vim will recognize the key code and replace it with
<F1> anyway.

Another problem may be that when keeping ALT or Meta pressed the terminal
prepends ESC instead of setting the 8th bit.  See |:map-alt-keys|.

						*recursive_mapping*
If you include the {lhs} in the {rhs} you have a recursive mapping.  When
{lhs} is typed, it will be replaced with {rhs}.  When the {lhs} which is
included in {rhs} is encountered it will be replaced with {rhs}, and so on.
This makes it possible to repeat a command an infinite number of times.  The
only problem is that the only way to stop this is by causing an error.  The
macros to solve a maze uses this, look there for an example.  There is one
exception: If the {rhs} starts with {lhs}, the first character is not mapped
again (this is Vi compatible).
For example: >
   :map ab abcd
will execute the "a" command and insert "bcd" in the text.  The "ab" in the
{rhs} will not be mapped again.

If you want to exchange the meaning of two keys you should use the :noremap
command.  For example: >
   :noremap k j
   :noremap j k
This will exchange the cursor up and down commands.

With the normal :map command, when the 'remap' option is on, mapping takes
place until the text is found not to be a part of a {lhs}.  For example, if
you use: >
   :map x y
   :map y x
Vim will replace x with y, and then y with x, etc.  When this has happened
'maxmapdepth' times (default 1000), Vim will give the error message
"recursive mapping".

							*:map-undo*
If you include an undo command inside a mapped sequence, this will bring the
text back in the state before executing the macro.  This is compatible with
the original Vi, as long as there is only one undo command in the mapped
sequence (having two undo commands in a mapped sequence did not make sense
in the original Vi, you would get back the text before the first undo).


1.10 MAPPING ALT-KEYS					*:map-alt-keys*

In the GUI Vim handles the Alt key itself, thus mapping keys with ALT should
always work.  But in a terminal Vim gets a sequence of bytes and has to figure
out whether ALT was pressed or not.

By default Vim assumes that pressing the ALT key sets the 8th bit of a typed
character.  Most decent terminals can work that way, such as xterm, aterm and
rxvt.  If your <A-k> mappings don't work it might be that the terminal is
prefixing the character with an ESC character.  But you can just as well type
ESC before a character, thus Vim doesn't know what happened (except for
checking the delay between characters, which is not reliable).

As of this writing, some mainstream terminals like gnome-terminal and konsole
use the ESC prefix.  There doesn't appear a way to have them use the 8th bit
instead.  Xterm should work well by default.  Aterm and rxvt should work well
when started with the "--meta8" argument.  You can also tweak resources like
"metaSendsEscape", "eightBitInput" and "eightBitOutput".

On the Linux console, this behavior can be toggled with the "setmetamode"
command.  Bear in mind that not using an ESC prefix could get you in trouble
with other programs.  You should make sure that bash has the "convert-meta"
option set to "on" in order for your Meta keybindings to still work on it
(it's the default readline behavior, unless changed by specific system
configuration).  For that, you can add the line: >

	set convert-meta on

to your ~/.inputrc file. If you're creating the file, you might want to use: >

	$include /etc/inputrc

as the first line, if that file exists on your system, to keep global options.
This may cause a problem for entering special characters, such as the umlaut.
Then you should use CTRL-V before that character.

Bear in mind that convert-meta has been reported to have troubles when used in
UTF-8 locales.  On terminals like xterm, the "metaSendsEscape" resource can be
toggled on the fly through the "Main Options" menu, by pressing Ctrl-LeftClick
on the terminal; that's a good last resource in case you want to send ESC when
using other applications but not when inside VIM.


1.11 MAPPING AN OPERATOR				*:map-operator*

An operator is used before a {motion} command.  To define your own operator
you must create mapping that first sets the 'operatorfunc' option and then
invoke the |g@| operator.  After the user types the {motion} command the
specified function will be called.

							*g@* *E774* *E775*
g@{motion}		Call the function set by the 'operatorfunc' option.
			The '[ mark is positioned at the start of the text
			moved over by {motion}, the '] mark on the last
			character of the text.
			The function is called with one String argument:
			    "line"	{motion} was |linewise|
			    "char"	{motion} was |characterwise|
			    "block"	{motion} was |blockwise-visual|
			Although "block" would rarely appear, since it can
			only result from Visual mode where "g@" is not useful.
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}

Here is an example that counts the number of spaces with <F4>: >

	nmap <silent> <F4> :set opfunc=CountSpaces<CR>g@
	vmap <silent> <F4> :<C-U>call CountSpaces(visualmode(), 1)<CR>

	function! CountSpaces(type, ...)
	  let sel_save = &selection
	  let &selection = "inclusive"
	  let reg_save = @@

	  if a:0  " Invoked from Visual mode, use gv command.
	    silent exe "normal! gvy"
	  elseif a:type == 'line'
	    silent exe "normal! '[V']y"
	  else
	    silent exe "normal! `[v`]y"
	  endif

	  echomsg strlen(substitute(@@, '[^ ]', '', 'g'))

	  let &selection = sel_save
	  let @@ = reg_save
	endfunction

Note that the 'selection' option is temporarily set to "inclusive" to be able
to yank exactly the right text by using Visual mode from the '[ to the ']
mark.

Also note that there is a separate mapping for Visual mode.  It removes the
"'<,'>" range that ":" inserts in Visual mode and invokes the function with
visualmode() and an extra argument.

==============================================================================
2. Abbreviations			*abbreviations* *Abbreviations*

Abbreviations are used in Insert mode, Replace mode and Command-line mode.
If you enter a word that is an abbreviation, it is replaced with the word it
stands for.  This can be used to save typing for often used long words.  And
you can use it to automatically correct obvious spelling errors.
Examples:

	:iab ms Microsoft
	:iab tihs this

There are three types of abbreviations:

full-id	  The "full-id" type consists entirely of keyword characters (letters
	  and characters from 'iskeyword' option).  This is the most common
	  abbreviation.

	  Examples: "foo", "g3", "-1"

end-id	  The "end-id" type ends in a keyword character, but all the other
	  characters are not keyword characters.

	  Examples: "#i", "..f", "$/7"

non-id	  The "non-id" type ends in a non-keyword character, the other
	  characters may be of any type, excluding space and tab.  {this type
	  is not supported by Vi}

	  Examples: "def#", "4/7$"

Examples of strings that cannot be abbreviations: "a.b", "#def", "a b", "_$r"

An abbreviation is only recognized when you type a non-keyword character.
This can also be the <Esc> that ends insert mode or the <CR> that ends a
command.  The non-keyword character which ends the abbreviation is inserted
after the expanded abbreviation.  An exception to this is the character <C-]>,
which is used to expand an abbreviation without inserting any extra
characters.

Example: >
   :ab hh	hello
<	    "hh<Space>" is expanded to "hello<Space>"
	    "hh<C-]>" is expanded to "hello"

The characters before the cursor must match the abbreviation.  Each type has
an additional rule:

full-id	  In front of the match is a non-keyword character, or this is where
	  the line or insertion starts.  Exception: When the abbreviation is
	  only one character, it is not recognized if there is a non-keyword
	  character in front of it, other than a space or a tab.

end-id	  In front of the match is a keyword character, or a space or a tab,
	  or this is where the line or insertion starts.

non-id	  In front of the match is a space, tab or the start of the line or
	  the insertion.

Examples: ({CURSOR} is where you type a non-keyword character) >
   :ab foo   four old otters
<		" foo{CURSOR}"	  is expanded to " four old otters"
		" foobar{CURSOR}" is not expanded
		"barfoo{CURSOR}"  is not expanded
>
   :ab #i #include
<		"#i{CURSOR}"	  is expanded to "#include"
		">#i{CURSOR}"	  is not expanded
>
   :ab ;; <endofline>
<		"test;;"	  is not expanded
		"test ;;"	  is expanded to "test <endofline>"

To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode: Type CTRL-V before the character
that would trigger the abbreviation.  E.g. CTRL-V <Space>.  Or type part of
the abbreviation, exit insert mode with <Esc>, re-enter insert mode with "a"
and type the rest.

To avoid the abbreviation in Command-line mode: Type CTRL-V twice somewhere in
the abbreviation to avoid it to be replaced.  A CTRL-V in front of a normal
character is mostly ignored otherwise.

It is possible to move the cursor after an abbreviation: >
   :iab if if ()<Left>
This does not work if 'cpoptions' includes the '<' flag. |<>|

You can even do more complicated things.  For example, to consume the space
typed after an abbreviation: >
   func Eatchar(pat)
      let c = nr2char(getchar(0))
      return (c =~ a:pat) ? '' : c
   endfunc
   iabbr <silent> if if ()<Left><C-R>=Eatchar('\s')<CR>

There are no default abbreviations.

Abbreviations are never recursive.  You can use ":ab f f-o-o" without any
problem.  But abbreviations can be mapped.  {some versions of Vi support
recursive abbreviations, for no apparent reason}

Abbreviations are disabled if the 'paste' option is on.

				*:abbreviate-local* *:abbreviate-<buffer>*
Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.  This is mostly
used in a |filetype-plugin| file.  Example for a C plugin file: >
	:abb <buffer> FF  for (i = 0; i < ; ++i)
<
						*:ab* *:abbreviate*
:ab[breviate]		list all abbreviations.  The character in the first
			column indicates the mode where the abbreviation is
			used: 'i' for insert mode, 'c' for Command-line
			mode, '!' for both.  These are the same as for
			mappings, see |map-listing|.

						*:abbreviate-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing an abbreviation will also display where it
was last defined.  Example: >

	:verbose abbreviate
	!  teh		 the
		Last set from /home/abcd/vim/abbr.vim

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

:ab[breviate] {lhs}	list the abbreviations that start with {lhs}
			You may need to insert a CTRL-V (type it twice) to
			avoid that a typed {lhs} is expanded, since
			command-line abbreviations apply here.

:ab[breviate] [<expr>] [<buffer>] {lhs} {rhs}
			add abbreviation for {lhs} to {rhs}.  If {lhs} already
			existed it is replaced with the new {rhs}.  {rhs} may
			contain spaces.
			See |:map-<expr>| for the optional <expr> argument.
			See |:map-<buffer>| for the optional <buffer> argument.

						*:una* *:unabbreviate*
:una[bbreviate] {lhs}	Remove abbreviation for {lhs} from the list.  If none
			is found, remove abbreviations in which {lhs} matches
			with the {rhs}.  This is done so that you can even
			remove abbreviations after expansion.  To avoid
			expansion insert a CTRL-V (type it twice).

						*:norea* *:noreabbrev*
:norea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but no remapping for this {rhs} {not
			in Vi}

						*:ca* *:cabbrev*
:ca[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Command-line mode only.  {not
			in Vi}

						*:cuna* *:cunabbrev*
:cuna[bbrev] {lhs}	same as ":una", but for Command-line mode only.  {not
			in Vi}

						*:cnorea* *:cnoreabbrev*
:cnorea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Command-line mode only and no
			remapping for this {rhs} {not in Vi}

						*:ia* *:iabbrev*
:ia[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Insert mode only.  {not in Vi}

						*:iuna* *:iunabbrev*
:iuna[bbrev] {lhs}	same as ":una", but for insert mode only.  {not in
			Vi}

						*:inorea* *:inoreabbrev*
:inorea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Insert mode only and no
			remapping for this {rhs} {not in Vi}

							*:abc* *:abclear*
:abc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations.  {not in Vi}

							*:iabc* *:iabclear*
:iabc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations for Insert mode.  {not in Vi}

							*:cabc* *:cabclear*
:cabc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations for Command-line mode.  {not
			in Vi}

							*using_CTRL-V*
It is possible to use special characters in the rhs of an abbreviation.
CTRL-V has to be used to avoid the special meaning of most non printable
characters.  How many CTRL-Vs need to be typed depends on how you enter the
abbreviation.  This also applies to mappings.  Let's use an example here.

Suppose you want to abbreviate "esc" to enter an <Esc> character.  When you
type the ":ab" command in Vim, you have to enter this: (here ^V is a CTRL-V
and ^[ is <Esc>)

You type:   ab esc ^V^V^V^V^V^[

	All keyboard input is subjected to ^V quote interpretation, so
	the first, third, and fifth ^V  characters simply allow the second,
	and fourth ^Vs, and the ^[, to be entered into the command-line.

You see:    ab esc ^V^V^[

	The command-line contains two actual ^Vs before the ^[.  This is
	how it should appear in your .exrc file, if you choose to go that
	route.  The first ^V is there to quote the second ^V; the :ab
	command uses ^V as its own quote character, so you can include quoted
	whitespace or the | character in the abbreviation.  The :ab command
	doesn't do anything special with the ^[ character, so it doesn't need
	to be quoted.  (Although quoting isn't harmful; that's why typing 7
	[but not 8!] ^Vs works.)

Stored as:  esc     ^V^[

	After parsing, the abbreviation's short form ("esc") and long form
	(the two characters "^V^[") are stored in the abbreviation table.
	If you give the :ab command with no arguments, this is how the
	abbreviation will be displayed.

	Later, when the abbreviation is expanded because the user typed in
	the word "esc", the long form is subjected to the same type of
	^V interpretation as keyboard input.  So the ^V protects the ^[
	character from being interpreted as the "exit Insert mode" character.
	Instead, the ^[ is inserted into the text.

Expands to: ^[

[example given by Steve Kirkendall]

==============================================================================
3. Local mappings and functions				*script-local*

When using several Vim script files, there is the danger that mappings and
functions used in one script use the same name as in other scripts.  To avoid
this, they can be made local to the script.

						*<SID>* *<SNR>* *E81*
The string "<SID>" can be used in a mapping or menu.  This requires that the
'<' flag is not present in 'cpoptions'.
   When executing the map command, Vim will replace "<SID>" with the special
key code <SNR>, followed by a number that's unique for the script, and an
underscore.  Example: >
	:map <SID>Add
could define a mapping "<SNR>23_Add".

When defining a function in a script, "s:" can be prepended to the name to
make it local to the script.  But when a mapping is executed from outside of
the script, it doesn't know in which script the function was defined.  To
avoid this problem, use "<SID>" instead of "s:".  The same translation is done
as for mappings.  This makes it possible to define a call to the function in
a mapping.

When a local function is executed, it runs in the context of the script it was
defined in.  This means that new functions and mappings it defines can also
use "s:" or "<SID>" and it will use the same unique number as when the
function itself was defined.  Also, the "s:var" local script variables can be
used.

When executing an autocommand or a user command, it will run in the context of
the script it was defined in.  This makes it possible that the command calls a
local function or uses a local mapping.

Otherwise, using "<SID>" outside of a script context is an error.

If you need to get the script number to use in a complicated script, you can
use this function: >
	function s:SID()
	  return matchstr(expand('<sfile>'), '<SNR>\zs\d\+\ze_SID$')
	endfun

The "<SNR>" will be shown when listing functions and mappings.  This is useful
to find out what they are defined to.

The |:scriptnames| command can be used to see which scripts have been sourced
and what their <SNR> number is.

This is all {not in Vi} and {not available when compiled without the |+eval|
feature}.

==============================================================================
4. User-defined commands				*user-commands*

It is possible to define your own Ex commands.  A user-defined command can act
just like a built-in command (it can have a range or arguments, arguments can
be completed as filenames or buffer names, etc), except that when the command
is executed, it is transformed into a normal Ex command and then executed.

For starters: See section |40.2| in the user manual.

					*E183* *E841* *user-cmd-ambiguous*
All user defined commands must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid
confusion with builtin commands.  Exceptions are these builtin commands:
	:Next
	:X
They cannot be used for a user defined command.  ":Print" is also an existing
command, but it is deprecated and can be overruled.

The other characters of the user command can be uppercase letters, lowercase
letters or digits.  When using digits, note that other commands that take a
numeric argument may become ambiguous.  For example, the command ":Cc2" could
be the user command ":Cc2" without an argument, or the command ":Cc" with
argument "2".  It is advised to put a space between the command name and the
argument to avoid these problems.

When using a user-defined command, the command can be abbreviated.  However, if
an abbreviation is not unique, an error will be issued.  Furthermore, a
built-in command will always take precedence.

Example: >
	:command Rename ...
	:command Renumber ...
	:Rena				" Means "Rename"
	:Renu				" Means "Renumber"
	:Ren				" Error - ambiguous
	:command Paste ...
	:P				" The built-in :Print

It is recommended that full names for user-defined commands are used in
scripts.

:com[mand]						*:com* *:command*
			List all user-defined commands.  When listing commands,
			the characters in the first two columns are
			    !	Command has the -bang attribute
			    "	Command has the -register attribute
			    b	Command is local to current buffer
			(see below for details on attributes)

:com[mand] {cmd}	List the user-defined commands that start with {cmd}

							*:command-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a command will also display where it was
last defined. Example: >

    :verbose command TOhtml
<	Name	    Args Range Complete  Definition ~
	TOhtml	    0	 %		 :call Convert2HTML(<line1>, <line2>) ~
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/plugin/tohtml.vim ~

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

							*E174* *E182*
:com[mand][!] [{attr}...] {cmd} {rep}
			Define a user command.  The name of the command is
			{cmd} and its replacement text is {rep}.  The command's
			attributes (see below) are {attr}.  If the command
			already exists, an error is reported, unless a ! is
			specified, in which case the command is redefined.

:delc[ommand] {cmd}				*:delc* *:delcommand* *E184*
			Delete the user-defined command {cmd}.

:comc[lear]						*:comc* *:comclear*
			Delete all user-defined commands.

Command attributes

User-defined commands are treated by Vim just like any other Ex commands.  They
can have arguments, or have a range specified.  Arguments are subject to
completion as filenames, buffers, etc.  Exactly how this works depends upon the
command's attributes, which are specified when the command is defined.

There are a number of attributes, split into four categories: argument
handling, completion behavior, range handling, and special cases.  The
attributes are described below, by category.

Argument handling				*E175* *E176* *:command-nargs*

By default, a user defined command will take no arguments (and an error is
reported if any are supplied).  However, it is possible to specify that the
command can take arguments, using the -nargs attribute.  Valid cases are:

	-nargs=0    No arguments are allowed (the default)
	-nargs=1    Exactly one argument is required, it includes spaces 
	-nargs=*    Any number of arguments are allowed (0, 1, or many),
		    separated by white space
	-nargs=?    0 or 1 arguments are allowed
	-nargs=+    Arguments must be supplied, but any number are allowed

Arguments are considered to be separated by (unescaped) spaces or tabs in this
context, except when there is one argument, then the white space is part of
the argument.

Note that arguments are used as text, not as expressions.  Specifically,
"s:var" will use the script-local variable in the script where the command was
defined, not where it is invoked!  Example:
    script1.vim: >
	:let s:error = "None"
	:command -nargs=1 Error echoerr <args>
<   script2.vim: >
	:source script1.vim
	:let s:error = "Wrong!"
	:Error s:error
Executing script2.vim will result in "None" being echoed.  Not what you
intended!  Calling a function may be an alternative.

Completion behavior				*:command-completion* *E179*
					*E180* *E181* *:command-complete*
By default, the arguments of user defined commands do not undergo completion.
However, by specifying one or the other of the following attributes, argument
completion can be enabled:

	-complete=augroup	autocmd groups
	-complete=buffer	buffer names
	-complete=behave	:behave suboptions
	-complete=color		color schemes
	-complete=command	Ex command (and arguments)
	-complete=compiler	compilers
	-complete=cscope	|:cscope| suboptions
	-complete=dir		directory names
	-complete=environment	environment variable names
	-complete=event		autocommand events
	-complete=expression	Vim expression
	-complete=file		file and directory names
	-complete=file_in_path	file and directory names in |'path'|
	-complete=filetype	filetype names |'filetype'|
	-complete=function	function name
	-complete=help		help subjects
	-complete=highlight	highlight groups
	-complete=history	:history suboptions
	-complete=locale	locale names (as output of locale -a)
	-complete=mapping	mapping name
	-complete=menu		menus
	-complete=option	options
	-complete=shellcmd	Shell command
	-complete=sign		|:sign| suboptions
	-complete=syntax	syntax file names |'syntax'|
	-complete=syntime	|:syntime| suboptions
	-complete=tag		tags
	-complete=tag_listfiles	tags, file names are shown when CTRL-D is hit
	-complete=user		user names
	-complete=var		user variables
	-complete=custom,{func} custom completion, defined via {func}
	-complete=customlist,{func} custom completion, defined via {func}

Note: That some completion methods might expand environment variables.


Custom completion			*:command-completion-custom*
					*:command-completion-customlist*
					*E467* *E468*
It is possible to define customized completion schemes via the "custom,{func}"
or the "customlist,{func}" completion argument.  The {func} part should be a
function with the following signature: >

	:function {func}(ArgLead, CmdLine, CursorPos)

The function need not use all these arguments. The function should provide the
completion candidates as the return value.

For the "custom" argument, the function should return the completion
candidates one per line in a newline separated string.

For the "customlist" argument, the function should return the completion
candidates as a Vim List.  Non-string items in the list are ignored.

The function arguments are:
	ArgLead		the leading portion of the argument currently being
			completed on
	CmdLine		the entire command line
	CursorPos	the cursor position in it (byte index)
The function may use these for determining context.  For the "custom"
argument, it is not necessary to filter candidates against the (implicit
pattern in) ArgLead.  Vim will filter the candidates with its regexp engine
after function return, and this is probably more efficient in most cases. For
the "customlist" argument, Vim will not filter the returned completion
candidates and the user supplied function should filter the candidates.

The following example lists user names to a Finger command >
    :com -complete=custom,ListUsers -nargs=1 Finger !finger <args>
    :fun ListUsers(A,L,P)
    :    return system("cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd")
    :endfun

The following example completes filenames from the directories specified in
the 'path' option: >
    :com -nargs=1 -bang -complete=customlist,EditFileComplete
			\ EditFile edit<bang> <args>
    :fun EditFileComplete(A,L,P)
    :    return split(globpath(&path, a:A), "\n")
    :endfun
<
This example does not work for file names with spaces!


Range handling				*E177* *E178* *:command-range*
							*:command-count*
By default, user-defined commands do not accept a line number range.  However,
it is possible to specify that the command does take a range (the -range
attribute), or that it takes an arbitrary count value, either in the line
number position (-range=N, like the |:split| command) or as a "count"
argument (-count=N, like the |:Next| command).  The count will then be
available in the argument with |<count>|.

Possible attributes are:

	-range	    Range allowed, default is current line
	-range=%    Range allowed, default is whole file (1,$)
	-range=N    A count (default N) which is specified in the line
		    number position (like |:split|); allows for zero line
		    number.
	-count=N    A count (default N) which is specified either in the line
		    number position, or as an initial argument (like |:Next|).
		    Specifying -count (without a default) acts like -count=0

Note that -range=N and -count=N are mutually exclusive - only one should be
specified.

Special cases				*:command-bang* *:command-bar*
					*:command-register* *:command-buffer*
There are some special cases as well:

	-bang	    The command can take a ! modifier (like :q or :w)
	-bar	    The command can be followed by a "|" and another command.
		    A "|" inside the command argument is not allowed then.
		    Also checks for a " to start a comment.
	-register   The first argument to the command can be an optional
		    register name (like :del, :put, :yank).
	-buffer	    The command will only be available in the current buffer.

In the cases of the -count and -register attributes, if the optional argument
is supplied, it is removed from the argument list and is available to the
replacement text separately.
Note that these arguments can be abbreviated, but that is a deprecated
feature.  Use the full name for new scripts.

Replacement text

The replacement text for a user defined command is scanned for special escape
sequences, using <...> notation.  Escape sequences are replaced with values
from the entered command line, and all other text is copied unchanged.  The
resulting string is executed as an Ex command.  To avoid the replacement use
<lt> in place of the initial <.  Thus to include "<bang>" literally use
"<lt>bang>".

The valid escape sequences are

						*<line1>*
	<line1>	The starting line of the command range.
						*<line2>*
	<line2>	The final line of the command range.
						*<count>*
	<count>	Any count supplied (as described for the '-range'
		and '-count' attributes).
						*<bang>*
	<bang>	(See the '-bang' attribute) Expands to a ! if the
		command was executed with a ! modifier, otherwise
		expands to nothing.
						*<reg>* *<register>*
	<reg>	(See the '-register' attribute) The optional register,
		if specified.  Otherwise, expands to nothing.  <register>
		is a synonym for this.
						*<args>*
	<args>	The command arguments, exactly as supplied (but as
		noted above, any count or register can consume some
		of the arguments, which are then not part of <args>).
	<lt>	A single '<' (Less-Than) character.  This is needed if you
		want to get a literal copy of one of these escape sequences
		into the expansion - for example, to get <bang>, use
		<lt>bang>.

							*<q-args>*
If the first two characters of an escape sequence are "q-" (for example,
<q-args>) then the value is quoted in such a way as to make it a valid value
for use in an expression.  This uses the argument as one single value.
When there is no argument <q-args> is an empty string.
							*<f-args>*
To allow commands to pass their arguments on to a user-defined function, there
is a special form <f-args> ("function args").  This splits the command
arguments at spaces and tabs, quotes each argument individually, and the
<f-args> sequence is replaced by the comma-separated list of quoted arguments.
See the Mycmd example below.  If no arguments are given <f-args> is removed.
   To embed whitespace into an argument of <f-args>, prepend a backslash.
<f-args> replaces every pair of backslashes (\\) with one backslash.  A
backslash followed by a character other than white space or a backslash
remains unmodified.  Overview:

	command		   <f-args> ~
	XX ab		   'ab'
	XX a\b		   'a\b'
	XX a\ b		   'a b'
	XX a\  b	   'a ', 'b'
	XX a\\b		   'a\b'
	XX a\\ b	   'a\', 'b'
	XX a\\\b	   'a\\b'
	XX a\\\ b	   'a\ b'
	XX a\\\\b	   'a\\b'
	XX a\\\\ b	   'a\\', 'b'

Examples >

   " Delete everything after here to the end
   :com Ddel +,$d

   " Rename the current buffer
   :com -nargs=1 -bang -complete=file Ren f <args>|w<bang>

   " Replace a range with the contents of a file
   " (Enter this all as one line)
   :com -range -nargs=1 -complete=file
	 Replace <line1>-pu_|<line1>,<line2>d|r <args>|<line1>d

   " Count the number of lines in the range
   :com! -range -nargs=0 Lines  echo <line2> - <line1> + 1 "lines"

   " Call a user function (example of <f-args>)
   :com -nargs=* Mycmd call Myfunc(<f-args>)

When executed as: >
	:Mycmd arg1 arg2
This will invoke: >
	:call Myfunc("arg1","arg2")

   :" A more substantial example
   :function Allargs(command)
   :   let i = 0
   :   while i < argc()
   :	  if filereadable(argv(i))
   :	     execute "e " . argv(i)
   :	     execute a:command
   :      endif
   :      let i = i + 1
   :   endwhile
   :endfunction
   :command -nargs=+ -complete=command Allargs call Allargs(<q-args>)

The command Allargs takes any Vim command(s) as argument and executes it on all
files in the argument list.  Usage example (note use of the "e" flag to ignore
errors and the "update" command to write modified buffers): >
	:Allargs %s/foo/bar/ge|update
This will invoke: >
	:call Allargs("%s/foo/bar/ge|update")
<
When defining a user command in a script, it will be able to call functions
local to the script and use mappings local to the script.  When the user
invokes the user command, it will run in the context of the script it was
defined in.  This matters if |<SID>| is used in a command.

not be represented using one byte (one octet).  Examples are Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.  Unicode is also covered here.

For an introduction to the most common features, see |usr_45.txt| in the user
manual.

==============================================================================
1. Getting started					*mbyte-first*

This is a summary of the multibyte features in Vim.  If you are lucky it works
as described and you can start using Vim without much trouble.  If something
doesn't work you will have to read the rest.  Don't be surprised if it takes
quite a bit of work and experimenting to make Vim use all the multi-byte
features.  Unfortunately, every system has its own way to deal with multibyte
languages and it is quite complicated.


COMPILING

If you already have a compiled Vim program, check if the |+multi_byte| feature
is included.  The |:version| command can be used for this.

If +multi_byte is not included, you should compile Vim with "normal", "big" or
"huge" features.  You can further tune what features are included.  See the
INSTALL files in the source directory.


LOCALE

First of all, you must make sure your current locale is set correctly.  If
your system has been installed to use the language, it probably works right
away.  If not, you can often make it work by setting the $LANG environment
variable in your shell: >

	setenv LANG ja_JP.EUC

Unfortunately, the name of the locale depends on your system.  Japanese might
also be called "ja_JP.EUCjp" or just "ja".  To see what is currently used: >

	:language

To change the locale inside Vim use: >

	:language ja_JP.EUC

Vim will give an error message if this doesn't work.  This is a good way to
experiment and find the locale name you want to use.  But it's always better
to set the locale in the shell, so that it is used right from the start.

See |mbyte-locale| for details.


ENCODING

If your locale works properly, Vim will try to set the 'encoding' option
accordingly.  If this doesn't work you can overrule its value: >

	:set encoding=utf-8

See |encoding-values| for a list of acceptable values.

The result is that all the text that is used inside Vim will be in this
encoding.  Not only the text in the buffers, but also in registers, variables,
etc.  This also means that changing the value of 'encoding' makes the existing
text invalid!  The text doesn't change, but it will be displayed wrong.

You can edit files in another encoding than what 'encoding' is set to.  Vim
will convert the file when you read it and convert it back when you write it.
See 'fileencoding', 'fileencodings' and |++enc|.


DISPLAY AND FONTS

If you are working in a terminal (emulator) you must make sure it accepts the
same encoding as which Vim is working with.  If this is not the case, you can
use the 'termencoding' option to make Vim convert text automatically.

For the GUI you must select fonts that work with the current 'encoding'.  This
is the difficult part.  It depends on the system you are using, the locale and
a few other things.  See the chapters on fonts: |mbyte-fonts-X11| for
X-Windows and |mbyte-fonts-MSwin| for MS-Windows.

For GTK+ 2, you can skip most of this section.  The option 'guifontset' does
no longer exist.  You only need to set 'guifont' and everything should "just
work".  If your system comes with Xft2 and fontconfig and the current font
does not contain a certain glyph, a different font will be used automatically
if available.  The 'guifontwide' option is still supported but usually you do
not need to set it.  It is only necessary if the automatic font selection does
not suit your needs.

For X11 you can set the 'guifontset' option to a list of fonts that together
cover the characters that are used.  Example for Korean: >

	:set guifontset=k12,r12

Alternatively, you can set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.  'guifont' is used for
the single-width characters, 'guifontwide' for the double-width characters.
Thus the 'guifontwide' font must be exactly twice as wide as 'guifont'.
Example for UTF-8: >

	:set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1
	:set guifontwide=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-180-iso10646-1

You can also set 'guifont' alone, Vim will try to find a matching
'guifontwide' for you.


INPUT

There are several ways to enter multi-byte characters:
- For X11 XIM can be used.  See |XIM|.
- For MS-Windows IME can be used.  See |IME|.
- For all systems keymaps can be used.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

==============================================================================
2.  Locale						*mbyte-locale*

The easiest setup is when your whole system uses the locale you want to work
in.  But it's also possible to set the locale for one shell you are working
in, or just use a certain locale inside Vim.


WHAT IS A LOCALE?					*locale*

There are many of languages in the world.  And there are different cultures
and environments at least as much as the number of languages.	A linguistic
environment corresponding to an area is called "locale".  This includes
information about the used language, the charset, collating order for sorting,
date format, currency format and so on.  For Vim only the language and charset
really matter.

You can only use a locale if your system has support for it.  Some systems
have only a few locales, especially in the USA.  The language which you want
to use may not be on your system.  In that case you might be able to install
it as an extra package.  Check your system documentation for how to do that.

The location in which the locales are installed varies from system to system.
For example, "/usr/share/locale" or "/usr/lib/locale".  See your system's
setlocale() man page.

Looking in these directories will show you the exact name of each locale.
Mostly upper/lowercase matters, thus "ja_JP.EUC" and "ja_jp.euc" are
different.  Some systems have a locale.alias file, which allows translation
from a short name like "nl" to the full name "nl_NL.ISO_8859-1".

Note that X-windows has its own locale stuff.  And unfortunately uses locale
names different from what is used elsewhere.  This is confusing!  For Vim it
matters what the setlocale() function uses, which is generally NOT the
X-windows stuff.  You might have to do some experiments to find out what
really works.

							*locale-name*
The (simplified) format of |locale| name is:

	language
or	language_territory
or	language_territory.codeset

Territory means the country (or part of it), codeset means the |charset|.  For
example, the locale name "ja_JP.eucJP" means:
	ja	the language is Japanese
	JP	the country is Japan
	eucJP	the codeset is EUC-JP
But it also could be "ja", "ja_JP.EUC", "ja_JP.ujis", etc.  And unfortunately,
the locale name for a specific language, territory and codeset is not unified
and depends on your system.

Examples of locale name:
    charset	    language		  locale name ~
    GB2312	    Chinese (simplified)  zh_CN.EUC, zh_CN.GB2312
    Big5	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW.BIG5, zh_TW.Big5
    CNS-11643	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW
    EUC-JP	    Japanese		  ja, ja_JP.EUC, ja_JP.ujis, ja_JP.eucJP
    Shift_JIS	    Japanese		  ja_JP.SJIS, ja_JP.Shift_JIS
    EUC-KR	    Korean		  ko, ko_KR.EUC


USING A LOCALE

To start using a locale for the whole system, see the documentation of your
system.  Mostly you need to set it in a configuration file in "/etc".

To use a locale in a shell, set the $LANG environment value.  When you want to
use Korean and the |locale| name is "ko", do this:

    sh:    export LANG=ko
    csh:   setenv LANG ko

You can put this in your ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc file to always use it.

To use a locale in Vim only, use the |:language| command: >

	:language ko

Put this in your ~/.vimrc file to use it always.

Or specify $LANG when starting Vim:

   sh:    LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}
   csh:	  env LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}

You could make a small shell script for this.

==============================================================================
3.  Encoding				*mbyte-encoding*

Vim uses the 'encoding' option to specify how characters are identified and
encoded when they are used inside Vim.  This applies to all the places where
text is used, including buffers (files loaded into memory), registers and
variables.

							*charset* *codeset*
Charset is another name for encoding.  There are subtle differences, but these
don't matter when using Vim.  "codeset" is another similar name.

Each character is encoded as one or more bytes.  When all characters are
encoded with one byte, we call this a single-byte encoding.  The most often
used one is called "latin1".  This limits the number of characters to 256.
Some of these are control characters, thus even fewer can be used for text.

When some characters use two or more bytes, we call this a multi-byte
encoding.  This allows using much more than 256 characters, which is required
for most East Asian languages.

Most multi-byte encodings use one byte for the first 127 characters.  These
are equal to ASCII, which makes it easy to exchange plain-ASCII text, no
matter what language is used.  Thus you might see the right text even when the
encoding was set wrong.

							*encoding-names*
Vim can use many different character encodings.  There are three major groups:

1   8bit	Single-byte encodings, 256 different characters.  Mostly used
		in USA and Europe.  Example: ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).  All
		characters occupy one screen cell only.

2   2byte	Double-byte encodings, over 10000 different characters.
		Mostly used in Asian countries.  Example: euc-kr (Korean)
		The number of screen cells is equal to the number of bytes
		(except for euc-jp when the first byte is 0x8e).

u   Unicode	Universal encoding, can replace all others.  ISO 10646.
		Millions of different characters.  Example: UTF-8.  The
		relation between bytes and screen cells is complex.

Other encodings cannot be used by Vim internally.  But files in other
encodings can be edited by using conversion, see 'fileencoding'.
Note that all encodings must use ASCII for the characters up to 128 (except
when compiled for EBCDIC).

Supported 'encoding' values are:			*encoding-values*
1   latin1	8-bit characters (ISO 8859-1, also used for cp1252)
1   iso-8859-n	ISO_8859 variant (n = 2 to 15)
1   koi8-r	Russian
1   koi8-u	Ukrainian
1   macroman    MacRoman (Macintosh encoding)
1   8bit-{name} any 8-bit encoding (Vim specific name)
1   cp437	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp737	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp775	Baltic
1   cp850	similar to iso-8859-4
1   cp852	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp855	similar to iso-8859-2
1   cp857	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp860	similar to iso-8859-9
1   cp861	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp862	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp863	similar to iso-8859-8
1   cp865	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp866	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp869	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp874	Thai
1   cp1250	Czech, Polish, etc.
1   cp1251	Cyrillic
1   cp1253	Greek
1   cp1254	Turkish
1   cp1255	Hebrew
1   cp1256	Arabic
1   cp1257	Baltic
1   cp1258	Vietnamese
1   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed single-byte codepage
2   cp932	Japanese (Windows only)
2   euc-jp	Japanese (Unix only)
2   sjis	Japanese (Unix only)
2   cp949	Korean (Unix and Windows)
2   euc-kr	Korean (Unix only)
2   cp936	simplified Chinese (Windows only)
2   euc-cn	simplified Chinese (Unix only)
2   cp950	traditional Chinese (on Unix alias for big5)
2   big5	traditional Chinese (on Windows alias for cp950)
2   euc-tw	traditional Chinese (Unix only)
2   2byte-{name} Unix: any double-byte encoding (Vim specific name)
2   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed double-byte codepage
u   utf-8	32 bit UTF-8 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2	16 bit UCS-2 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2le	like ucs-2, little endian
u   utf-16	ucs-2 extended with double-words for more characters
u   utf-16le	like utf-16, little endian
u   ucs-4	32 bit UCS-4 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-4le	like ucs-4, little endian

The {name} can be any encoding name that your system supports.  It is passed
to iconv() to convert between the encoding of the file and the current locale.
For MS-Windows "cp{number}" means using codepage {number}.
Examples: >
		:set encoding=8bit-cp1252
		:set encoding=2byte-cp932

The MS-Windows codepage 1252 is very similar to latin1.  For practical reasons
the same encoding is used and it's called latin1.  'isprint' can be used to
display the characters 0x80 - 0xA0 or not.

Several aliases can be used, they are translated to one of the names above.
An incomplete list:

1   ansi	same as latin1 (obsolete, for backward compatibility)
2   japan	Japanese: on Unix "euc-jp", on MS-Windows cp932
2   korea	Korean: on Unix "euc-kr", on MS-Windows cp949
2   prc		simplified Chinese: on Unix "euc-cn", on MS-Windows cp936
2   chinese     same as "prc"
2   taiwan	traditional Chinese: on Unix "euc-tw", on MS-Windows cp950
u   utf8	same as utf-8
u   unicode	same as ucs-2
u   ucs2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-4be	same as ucs-4 (big endian)
u   utf-32	same as ucs-4
u   utf-32le	same as ucs-4le
    default     stands for the default value of 'encoding', depends on the
		environment

For the UCS codes the byte order matters.  This is tricky, use UTF-8 whenever
you can.  The default is to use big-endian (most significant byte comes
first):
	    name	bytes		char ~
	    ucs-2	      11 22	    1122
	    ucs-2le	      22 11	    1122
	    ucs-4	11 22 33 44	11223344
	    ucs-4le	44 33 22 11	11223344

On MS-Windows systems you often want to use "ucs-2le", because it uses little
endian UCS-2.

There are a few encodings which are similar, but not exactly the same.  Vim
treats them as if they were different encodings, so that conversion will be
done when needed.  You might want to use the similar name to avoid conversion
or when conversion is not possible:

	cp932, shift-jis, sjis
	cp936, euc-cn

							*encoding-table*
Normally 'encoding' is equal to your current locale and 'termencoding' is
empty.  This means that your keyboard and display work with characters encoded
in your current locale, and Vim uses the same characters internally.

You can make Vim use characters in a different encoding by setting the
'encoding' option to a different value.  Since the keyboard and display still
use the current locale, conversion needs to be done.  The 'termencoding' then
takes over the value of the current locale, so Vim converts between 'encoding'
and 'termencoding'.  Example: >
	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

However, not all combinations of values are possible.  The table below tells
you how each of the nine combinations works.  This is further restricted by
not all conversions being possible, iconv() being present, etc.  Since this
depends on the system used, no detailed list can be given.

('tenc' is the short name for 'termencoding' and 'enc' short for 'encoding')

'tenc'	    'enc'	remark ~

 8bit	    8bit	Works.  When 'termencoding' is different from
			'encoding' typing and displaying may be wrong for some
			characters, Vim does NOT perform conversion (set
			'encoding' to "utf-8" to get this).
 8bit      2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; you can only type 8bit characters;
			Other systems: does NOT work.
 8bit	   Unicode	Works, but only 8bit characters can be typed directly
			(others through digraphs, keymaps, etc.); in a
			terminal you can only see 8bit characters; the GUI can
			show all characters that the 'guifont' supports.

 2byte	    8bit	Works, but typing non-ASCII characters might
			be a problem.
 2byte	   2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; typing characters might be a problem when
			locale is different from 'encoding'.
			Other systems: Only works when 'termencoding' is equal
			to 'encoding', you might as well leave it empty.
 2byte	   Unicode	works, Vim will translate typed characters.

 Unicode    8bit	works (unusual)
 Unicode    2byte	does NOT work
 Unicode   Unicode	works very well (leaving 'termencoding' empty works
			the same way, because all Unicode is handled
			internally as UTF-8)

CONVERSION						*charset-conversion*

Vim will automatically convert from one to another encoding in several places:
- When reading a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When writing a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying characters and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When reading input and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying messages and the encoding used for LC_MESSAGES differs from
  'encoding' (requires a gettext version that supports this).
- When reading a Vim script where |:scriptencoding| is different from
  'encoding'.
- When reading or writing a |viminfo| file.
Most of these require the |+iconv| feature.  Conversion for reading and
writing files may also be specified with the 'charconvert' option.

Useful utilities for converting the charset:
    All:	    iconv
	GNU iconv can convert most encodings.  Unicode is used as the
	intermediate encoding, which allows conversion from and to all other
	encodings.  See http://www.gnu.org/directory/libiconv.html.

    Japanese:	    nkf
	Nkf is "Network Kanji code conversion Filter".  One of the most unique
	facility of nkf is the guess of the input Kanji code.  So, you don't
	need to know what the inputting file's |charset| is.  When convert to
	EUC-JP from ISO-2022-JP or Shift_JIS, simply do the following command
	in Vim:
	    :%!nkf -e
	Nkf can be found at:
	http://www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~max/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/nkf-1.62.tar.gz

    Chinese:	    hc
	Hc is "Hanzi Converter".  Hc convert a GB file to a Big5 file, or Big5
	file to GB file.  Hc can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/unix/convert/hc-30.tar.gz

    Korean:	    hmconv
	Hmconv is Korean code conversion utility especially for E-mail.  It can
	convert between EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.  Hmconv can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.kaist.ac.kr/pub/hangul/code/hmconv/

    Multilingual:   lv
	Lv is a Powerful Multilingual File Viewer.  And it can be worked as
	|charset| converter.  Supported |charset|: ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP,
	ISO-2022-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, UTF-7, UTF-8, ISO-8859
	series, Shift_JIS, Big5 and HZ.  Lv can be found at:
	http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~nrt/lv/index.html


							*mbyte-conversion*
When reading and writing files in an encoding different from 'encoding',
conversion needs to be done.  These conversions are supported:
- All conversions between Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, UCS-2 and UCS-4 are
  handled internally.
- For MS-Windows, when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding, conversion from and
  to any codepage should work.
- Conversion specified with 'charconvert'
- Conversion with the iconv library, if it is available.
	Old versions of GNU iconv() may cause the conversion to fail (they
	request a very large buffer, more than Vim is willing to provide).
	Try getting another iconv() implementation.

							*iconv-dynamic*
On MS-Windows Vim can be compiled with the |+iconv/dyn| feature.  This means
Vim will search for the "iconv.dll" and "libiconv.dll" libraries.  When
neither of them can be found Vim will still work but some conversions won't be
possible.

==============================================================================
4. Using a terminal					*mbyte-terminal*

The GUI fully supports multi-byte characters.  It is also possible in a
terminal, if the terminal supports the same encoding that Vim uses.  Thus this
is less flexible.

For example, you can run Vim in a xterm with added multi-byte support and/or
|XIM|.  Examples are kterm (Kanji term) and hanterm (for Korean), Eterm
(Enlightened terminal) and rxvt.

If your terminal does not support the right encoding, you can set the
'termencoding' option.  Vim will then convert the typed characters from
'termencoding' to 'encoding'.  And displayed text will be converted from
'encoding' to 'termencoding'.  If the encoding supported by the terminal
doesn't include all the characters that Vim uses, this leads to lost
characters.  This may mess up the display.  If you use a terminal that
supports Unicode, such as the xterm mentioned below, it should work just fine,
since nearly every character set can be converted to Unicode without loss of
information.


UTF-8 IN XFREE86 XTERM					*UTF8-xterm*

This is a short explanation of how to use UTF-8 character encoding in the
xterm that comes with XFree86 by Thomas Dickey (text by Markus Kuhn).

Get the latest xterm version which has now UTF-8 support:

	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html

Compile it with "./configure --enable-wide-chars ; make"

Also get the ISO 10646-1 version of various fonts, which is available on

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz

and install the font as described in the README file.

Now start xterm with >

  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1
or, for bigger character: >
  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

and you will have a working UTF-8 terminal emulator.  Try both >

   cat utf-8-demo.txt
   vim utf-8-demo.txt

with the demo text that comes with ucs-fonts.tar.gz in order to see
whether there are any problems with UTF-8 in your xterm.

For Vim you may need to set 'encoding' to "utf-8".

==============================================================================
5.  Fonts on X11					*mbyte-fonts-X11*

Unfortunately, using fonts in X11 is complicated.  The name of a single-byte
font is a long string.  For multi-byte fonts we need several of these...

Note: Most of this is no longer relevant for GTK+ 2.  Selecting a font via
its XLFD is not supported; see 'guifont' for an example of how to
set the font.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the |XLFD| and |xfontset|
sections below.

First of all, Vim only accepts fixed-width fonts for displaying text.  You
cannot use proportionally spaced fonts.  This excludes many of the available
(and nicer looking) fonts.  However, for menus and tooltips any font can be
used.

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.

You should get a default font for menus and tooltips that works, but it might
be ugly.  Read the following to find out how to select a better font.


X LOGICAL FONT DESCRIPTION (XLFD)
							*XLFD*
XLFD is the X font name and contains the information about the font size,
charset, etc.  The name is in this format:

FOUNDRY-FAMILY-WEIGHT-SLANT-WIDTH-STYLE-PIXEL-POINT-X-Y-SPACE-AVE-CR-CE

Each field means:

- FOUNDRY:  FOUNDRY field.  The company that created the font.
- FAMILY:   FAMILY_NAME field.  Basic font family name.  (helvetica, gothic,
	    times, etc)
- WEIGHT:   WEIGHT_NAME field.  How thick the letters are.  (light, medium,
	    bold, etc)
- SLANT:    SLANT field.
		r:  Roman (no slant)
		i:  Italic
		o:  Oblique
		ri: Reverse Italic
		ro: Reverse Oblique
		ot: Other
		number:	Scaled font
- WIDTH:    SETWIDTH_NAME field.  Width of characters.  (normal, condensed,
	    narrow, double wide)
- STYLE:    ADD_STYLE_NAME field.  Extra info to describe font.  (Serif, Sans
	    Serif, Informal, Decorated, etc)
- PIXEL:    PIXEL_SIZE field.  Height, in pixels, of characters.
- POINT:    POINT_SIZE field.  Ten times height of characters in points.
- X:	    RESOLUTION_X field.  X resolution (dots per inch).
- Y:	    RESOLUTION_Y field.  Y resolution (dots per inch).
- SPACE:    SPACING field.
		p:  Proportional
		m:  Monospaced
		c:  CharCell
- AVE:	    AVERAGE_WIDTH field.  Ten times average width in pixels.
- CR:	    CHARSET_REGISTRY field.  The name of the charset group.
- CE:	    CHARSET_ENCODING field.  The rest of the charset name.  For some
	    charsets, such as JIS X 0208, if this field is 0, code points has
	    the same value as GL, and GR if 1.

For example, in case of a 16 dots font corresponding to JIS X 0208, it is
written like:
    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1990-0


X FONTSET
						*fontset* *xfontset*
A single-byte charset is typically associated with one font.  For multi-byte
charsets a combination of fonts is often used.  This means that one group of
characters are used from one font and another group from another font (which
might be double wide).  This collection of fonts is called a fontset.

Which fonts are required in a fontset depends on the current locale.  X
windows maintains a table of which groups of characters are required for a
locale.  You have to specify all the fonts that a locale requires in the
'guifontset' option.

NOTE: The fontset always uses the current locale, even though 'encoding' may
be set to use a different charset.  In that situation you might want to use
'guifont' and 'guifontwide' instead of 'guifontset'.

Example:
    |charset| language		    "groups of characters" ~
    GB2312    Chinese (simplified)  ISO-8859-1 and GB 2312
    Big5      Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1 and Big5
    CNS-11643 Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1, CNS 11643-1 and CNS 11643-2
    EUC-JP    Japanese		    JIS X 0201 and JIS X 0208
    EUC-KR    Korean		    ISO-8859-1 and KS C 5601 (KS X 1001)

You can search for fonts using the xlsfonts command.  For example, when you're
searching for a font for KS C 5601: >
    xlsfonts | grep ksc5601

This is complicated and confusing.  You might want to consult the X-Windows
documentation if there is something you don't understand.

						*base_font_name_list*
When you have found the names of the fonts you want to use, you need to set
the 'guifontset' option.  You specify the list by concatenating the font names
and putting a comma in between them.

For example, when you use the ja_JP.eucJP locale, this requires JIS X 0201
and JIS X 0208.  You could supply a list of fonts that explicitly specifies
the charsets, like: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-jisx0208.1983-0,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-jisx0201.1976-0

Alternatively, you can supply a base font name list that omits the charset
name, letting X-Windows select font characters required for the locale.  For
example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70

Alternatively, you can supply a single base font name that allows X-Windows to
select from all available fonts.  For example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*

Alternatively, you can specify alias names.  See the fonts.alias file in the
fonts directory (e.g., /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/).  For example: >

 :set guifontset=k14,r14
<
							*E253*
Note that in East Asian fonts, the standard character cell is square.  When
mixing a Latin font and an East Asian font, the East Asian font width should
be twice the Latin font width.

If 'guifontset' is not empty, the "font" argument of the |:highlight| command
is also interpreted as a fontset.  For example, you should use for
highlighting: >
	:hi Comment font=english_font,your_font
If you use a wrong "font" argument you will get an error message.
Also make sure that you set 'guifontset' before setting fonts for highlight
groups.


USING RESOURCE FILES

Instead of specifying 'guifontset', you can set X11 resources and Vim will
pick them up.  This is only for people who know how X resource files work.

For Motif and Athena insert these three lines in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:

	Vim.font: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontSet: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontList: your_language_font

Note: Vim.font is for text area.
      Vim*fontSet is for menu.
      Vim*fontList is for menu (for Motif GUI)

For example, when you are using Japanese and a 14 dots font, >

	Vim.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontSet: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontList: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
<
or: >

	Vim*font: k14,r14
	Vim*fontSet: k14,r14
	Vim*fontList: k14,r14
<
To have them take effect immediately you will have to do >

	xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults

Otherwise you will have to stop and restart the X server before the changes
take effect.


The GTK+ version of GUI Vim does not use .Xdefaults, use ~/.gtkrc instead.
The default mostly works OK.  But for the menus you might have to change
it.  Example: >

	style "default"
	{
		fontset="-*-*-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-*-*"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "default"

==============================================================================
6.  Fonts on MS-Windows				*mbyte-fonts-MSwin*

The simplest is to use the font dialog to select fonts and try them out.  You
can find this at the "Edit/Select Font..." menu.  Once you find a font name
that works well you can use this command to see its name: >

	:set guifont

Then add a command to your |gvimrc| file to set 'guifont': >

	:set guifont=courier_new:h12

==============================================================================
7.  Input on X11				*mbyte-XIM*

X INPUT METHOD (XIM) BACKGROUND			*XIM* *xim* *x-input-method*

XIM is an international input module for X.  There are two kinds of structures,
Xlib unit type and |IM-server| (Input-Method server) type.  |IM-server| type
is suitable for complex input, such as CJK.

- IM-server
							*IM-server*
  In |IM-server| type input structures, the input event is handled by either
  of the two ways: FrontEnd system and BackEnd system.  In the FrontEnd
  system, input events are snatched by the |IM-server| first, then |IM-server|
  give the application the result of input.  On the other hand, the BackEnd
  system works reverse order.  MS Windows adopt BackEnd system.  In X, most of
  |IM-server|s adopt FrontEnd system.  The demerit of BackEnd system is the
  large overhead in communication, but it provides safe synchronization with
  no restrictions on applications.

  For example, there are xwnmo and kinput2 Japanese |IM-server|, both are
  FrontEnd system.  Xwnmo is distributed with Wnn (see below), kinput2 can be
  found at: ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2/

  For Chinese, there's a great XIM server named "xcin", you can input both
  Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters.  And it can accept other
  locale if you make a correct input table.  Xcin can be found at:
  http://cle.linux.org.tw/xcin/
  Others are scim: http://scim.freedesktop.org/ and fcitx:
  http://www.fcitx.org/

- Conversion Server
							*conversion-server*
  Some system needs additional server: conversion server.  Most of Japanese
  |IM-server|s need it, Kana-Kanji conversion server.  For Chinese inputting,
  it depends on the method of inputting, in some methods, PinYin or ZhuYin to
  HanZi conversion server is needed.  For Korean inputting, if you want to
  input Hanja, Hangul-Hanja conversion server is needed.

  For example, the Japanese inputting process is divided into 2 steps.  First
  we pre-input Hira-gana, second Kana-Kanji conversion.  There are so many
  Kanji characters (6349 Kanji characters are defined in JIS X 0208) and the
  number of Hira-gana characters are 76.  So, first, we pre-input text as
  pronounced in Hira-gana, second, we convert Hira-gana to Kanji or Kata-Kana,
  if needed.  There are some Kana-Kanji conversion server: jserver
  (distributed with Wnn, see below) and canna.  Canna can be found at:
  http://canna.sourceforge.jp/

There is a good input system: Wnn4.2.  Wnn 4.2 contains,
    xwnmo (|IM-server|)
    jserver (Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion server)
    cserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to simplified HanZi conversion server)
    tserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to traditional HanZi conversion server)
    kserver (Hangul-Hanja conversion server)
Wnn 4.2 for several systems can be found at various places on the internet.
Use the RPM or port for your system.


- Input Style
							*xim-input-style*
  When inputting CJK, there are four areas:
      1. The area to display of the input while it is being composed
      2. The area to display the currently active input mode.
      3. The area to display the next candidate for the selection.
      4. The area to display other tools.

  The third area is needed when converting.  For example, in Japanese
  inputting, multiple Kanji characters could have the same pronunciation, so
  a sequence of Hira-gana characters could map to a distinct sequence of Kanji
  characters.

  The first and second areas are defined in international input of X with the
  names of "Preedit Area", "Status Area" respectively.  The third and fourth
  areas are not defined and are left to be managed by the |IM-server|.  In the
  international input, four input styles have been defined using combinations
  of Preedit Area and Status Area: |OnTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |OverTheSpot|
  and |Root|.

  Currently, GUI Vim supports three styles, |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot| and
  |Root|.

*.  on-the-spot						*OnTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed by the client application in
    the area of application.  The client application is directed by the
    |IM-server| to display all pre-edit data at the location of text
    insertion.  The client registers callbacks invoked by the input method
    during pre-editing.
*.  over-the-spot					*OverTheSpot*
    Status Area is created in a fixed position within the area of application,
    in case of Vim, the position is the additional status line.  Preedit Area
    is made at present input position of application.  The input method
    displays pre-edit data in a window which it brings up directly over the
    text insertion position.
*.  off-the-spot					*OffTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed in the area of application, in
    case of Vim, the area is additional status line.  The client application
    provides display windows for the pre-edit data to the input method which
    displays into them directly.
*.  root-window						*Root*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are outside of the application.  The input
    method displays all pre-edit data in a separate area of the screen in a
    window specific to the input method.


USING XIM			*multibyte-input* *E284* *E286* *E287* *E288*
				*E285* *E289*

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.  But when your Display
method doesn't match your Input method, the text will be displayed wrong.

	Note: You can not use IM unless you specify 'guifontset'.
	      Therefore, Latin users, you have to also use 'guifontset'
	      if you use IM.

To input your language you should run the |IM-server| which supports your
language and |conversion-server| if needed.

The next 3 lines should be put in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  They are common for
all X applications which uses |XIM|.  If you already use |XIM|, you can skip
this. >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: your_input_server_name
	*.preeditType: your_input_style
<
input_server_name	is your |IM-server| name (check your |IM-server|
			manual).
your_input_style	is one of |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |Root|.  See
			also |xim-input-style|.

*international may not necessary if you use X11R6.
*.inputMethod and *.preeditType are optional if you use X11R6.

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server|, >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: kinput2
	*.preeditType: OverTheSpot
<
When using |OverTheSpot|, GUI Vim always connects to the IM Server even in
Normal mode, so you can input your language with commands like "f" and "r".
But when using one of the other two methods, GUI Vim connects to the IM Server
only if it is not in Normal mode.

If your IM Server does not support |OverTheSpot|, and if you want to use your
language with some Normal mode command like "f" or "r", then you should use a
localized xterm  or an xterm which supports |XIM|

If needed, you can set the XMODIFIERS environment variable:

	sh:  export XMODIFIERS="@im=input_server_name"
	csh: setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=input_server_name"

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server| and sh, >

	export XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"
<

FULLY CONTROLLED XIM

You can fully control XIM, like with IME of MS-Windows (see |multibyte-ime|).
This is currently only available for the GTK GUI.

Before using fully controlled XIM, one setting is required.  Set the
'imactivatekey' option to the key that is used for the activation of the input
method.  For example, when you are using kinput2 + canna as IM Server, the
activation key is probably Shift+Space: >

	:set imactivatekey=S-space

See 'imactivatekey' for the format.

==============================================================================
8.  Input on MS-Windows					*mbyte-IME*

(Windows IME support)				*multibyte-ime* *IME*

{only works Windows GUI and compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime| feature}

To input multibyte characters on Windows, you can use an Input Method Editor
(IME).  In process of your editing text, you must switch status (on/off) of
IME many many many times.  Because IME with status on is hooking all of your
key inputs, you cannot input 'j', 'k', or almost all of keys to Vim directly.

This |+multi_byte_ime| feature help this.  It reduce times of switch status of
IME manually.  In normal mode, there are almost no need working IME, even
editing multibyte text.  So exiting insert mode with ESC, Vim memorize last
status of IME and force turn off IME.  When re-enter insert mode, Vim revert
IME status to that memorized automatically.

This works on not only insert-normal mode, but also search-command input and
replace mode.
The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

WHAT IS IME
    IME is a part of East asian version Windows.  That helps you to input
    multibyte character.  English and other language version Windows does not
    have any IME.  (Also there is no need usually.) But there is one that
    called Microsoft Global IME.  Global IME is a part of Internet Explorer
    4.0 or above.  You can get more information about Global IME, at below
    URL.

WHAT IS GLOBAL IME					*global-ime*
    Global IME makes capability to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text
    into Vim buffer on any language version of Windows 98, Windows 95, and
    Windows NT 4.0.
    On Windows 2000 and XP it should work as well (without downloading).  On
    Windows 2000 Professional, Global IME is built in, and the Input Locales
    can be added through Control Panel/Regional Options/Input Locales.
    Please see below URL for detail of Global IME.  You can also find various
    language version of Global IME at same place.

    - Global IME detailed information.
	http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?q=global+ime

    - Active Input Method Manager (Global IME)
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741221(v=VS.85).aspx

    Support for Global IME is an experimental feature.

NOTE: For IME to work you must make sure the input locales of your language
are added to your system.  The exact location of this depends on the version
of Windows you use.  For example, on my Windows 2000 box:
1. Control Panel
2. Regional Options
3. Input Locales Tab
4. Add Installed input locales -> Chinese(PRC)
   The default is still English (United Stated)


Cursor color when IME or XIM is on				*CursorIM*
    There is a little cute feature for IME.  Cursor can indicate status of IME
    by changing its color.  Usually status of IME was indicated by little icon
    at a corner of desktop (or taskbar).  It is not easy to verify status of
    IME.  But this feature help this.
    This works in the same way when using XIM.

    You can select cursor color when status is on by using highlight group
    CursorIM.  For example, add these lines to your |gvimrc|: >

	if has('multi_byte_ime')
	    highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	    highlight CursorIM guifg=NONE guibg=Purple
	endif
<
    Cursor color with off IME is green.  And purple cursor indicates that
    status is on.

==============================================================================
9. Input with a keymap					*mbyte-keymap*

When the keyboard doesn't produce the characters you want to enter in your
text, you can use the 'keymap' option.  This will translate one or more
(English) characters to another (non-English) character.  This only happens
when typing text, not when typing Vim commands.  This avoids having to switch
between two keyboard settings.

The value of the 'keymap' option specifies a keymap file to use.  The name of
this file is one of these two:

	keymap/{keymap}_{encoding}.vim
	keymap/{keymap}.vim

Here {keymap} is the value of the 'keymap' option and {encoding} of the
'encoding' option.  The file name with the {encoding} included is tried first.

'runtimepath' is used to find these files.  To see an overview of all
available keymap files, use this: >
	:echo globpath(&rtp, "keymap/*.vim")

In Insert and Command-line mode you can use CTRL-^ to toggle between using the
keyboard map or not. |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|
This flag is remembered for Insert mode with the 'iminsert' option.  When
leaving and entering Insert mode the previous value is used.  The same value
is also used for commands that take a single character argument, like |f| and
|r|.
For Command-line mode the flag is NOT remembered.  You are expected to type an
Ex command first, which is ASCII.
For typing search patterns the 'imsearch' option is used.  It can be set to
use the same value as for 'iminsert'.
								*lCursor*
It is possible to give the GUI cursor another color when the language mappings
are being used.  This is disabled by default, to avoid that the cursor becomes
invisible when you use a non-standard background color.  Here is an example to
use a brightly colored cursor: >
	:highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	:highlight lCursor guifg=NONE guibg=Cyan
<
		*keymap-file-format* *:loadk* *:loadkeymap* *E105* *E791*
The keymap file looks something like this: >

	" Maintainer:	name <email@address>
	" Last Changed:	2001 Jan 1

	let b:keymap_name = "short"

	loadkeymap
	a	A
	b	B	comment

The lines starting with a " are comments and will be ignored.  Blank lines are
also ignored.  The lines with the mappings may have a comment after the useful
text.

The "b:keymap_name" can be set to a short name, which will be shown in the
status line.  The idea is that this takes less room than the value of
'keymap', which might be long to distinguish between different languages,
keyboards and encodings.

The actual mappings are in the lines below "loadkeymap".  In the example "a"
is mapped to "A" and "b" to "B".  Thus the first item is mapped to the second
item.  This is done for each line, until the end of the file.
These items are exactly the same as what can be used in a |:lnoremap| command,
using "<buffer>" to make the mappings local to the buffer.
You can check the result with this command: >
	:lmap
The two items must be separated by white space.  You cannot include white
space inside an item, use the special names "<Tab>" and "<Space>" instead.
The length of the two items together must not exceed 200 bytes.

It's possible to have more than one character in the first column.  This works
like a dead key.  Example: >
	'a	
Since Vim doesn't know if the next character after a quote is really an "a",
it will wait for the next character.  To be able to insert a single quote,
also add this line: >
	''	'
Since the mapping is defined with |:lnoremap| the resulting quote will not be
used for the start of another character.
The "accents" keymap uses this.				*keymap-accents*

The first column can also be in |<>| form:
	<C-c>		Ctrl-C
	<A-c>		Alt-c
	<A-C>		Alt-C
Note that the Alt mappings may not work, depending on your keyboard and
terminal.

Although it's possible to have more than one character in the second column,
this is unusual.  But you can use various ways to specify the character: >
	A	a		literal character
	A	<char-97>	decimal value
	A	<char-0x61>	hexadecimal value
	A	<char-0141>	octal value
	x	<Space>		special key name

The characters are assumed to be encoded for the current value of 'encoding'.
It's possible to use ":scriptencoding" when all characters are given
literally.  That doesn't work when using the <char-> construct, because the
conversion is done on the keymap file, not on the resulting character.

The lines after "loadkeymap" are interpreted with 'cpoptions' set to "C".
This means that continuation lines are not used and a backslash has a special
meaning in the mappings.  Examples: >

	" a comment line
	\"	x	maps " to x
	\\	y	maps \ to y

If you write a keymap file that will be useful for others, consider submitting
it to the Vim maintainer for inclusion in the distribution:
<maintainer@vim.org>

==============================================================================
10. Using UTF-8				*mbyte-utf8* *UTF-8* *utf-8* *utf8*
							*Unicode* *unicode*
The Unicode character set was designed to include all characters from other
character sets.  Therefore it is possible to write text in any language using
Unicode (with a few rarely used languages excluded).  And it's mostly possible
to mix these languages in one file, which is impossible with other encodings.

Unicode can be encoded in several ways.  The most popular one is UTF-8, which
uses one or more bytes for each character and is backwards compatible with
ASCII.   On MS-Windows UTF-16 is also used (previously UCS-2), which uses
16-bit words.  Vim can support all of these encodings, but always uses UTF-8
internally.

Vim has comprehensive UTF-8 support.  It works well in:
- xterm with utf-8 support enabled
- Athena, Motif and GTK GUI
- MS-Windows GUI
- several other platforms

Double-width characters are supported.  This works best with 'guifontwide' or
'guifontset'.  When using only 'guifont' the wide characters are drawn in the
normal width and a space to fill the gap.  Note that the 'guifontset' option
is no longer relevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI.

							*bom-bytes*
When reading a file a BOM (Byte Order Mark) can be used to recognize the
Unicode encoding:
	EF BB BF     utf-8
	FE FF        utf-16 big endian
	FF FE        utf-16 little endian
	00 00 FE FF  utf-32 big endian
	FF FE 00 00  utf-32 little endian

Utf-8 is the recommended encoding.  Note that it's difficult to tell utf-16
and utf-32 apart.  Utf-16 is often used on MS-Windows, utf-32 is not
widespread as file format.


					*mbyte-combining* *mbyte-composing*
A composing or combining character is used to change the meaning of the
character before it.  The combining characters are drawn on top of the
preceding character.
Up to two combining characters can be used by default.  This can be changed
with the 'maxcombine' option.
When editing text a composing character is mostly considered part of the
preceding character.  For example "x" will delete a character and its
following composing characters by default.
If the 'delcombine' option is on, then pressing 'x' will delete the combining
characters, one at a time, then the base character.  But when inserting, you
type the first character and the following composing characters separately,
after which they will be joined.  The "r" command will not allow you to type a
combining character, because it doesn't know one is coming.  Use "R" instead.

Bytes which are not part of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence are handled like a
single character and displayed as <xx>, where "xx" is the hex value of the
byte.

Overlong sequences are not handled specially and displayed like a valid
character.  However, search patterns may not match on an overlong sequence.
(an overlong sequence is where more bytes are used than required for the
character.)  An exception is NUL (zero) which is displayed as "<00>".

In the file and buffer the full range of Unicode characters can be used (31
bits).  However, displaying only works for the characters present in the
selected font.

Useful commands:
- "ga" shows the decimal, hexadecimal and octal value of the character under
  the cursor.  If there are composing characters these are shown too.  (If the
  message is truncated, use ":messages").
- "g8" shows the bytes used in a UTF-8 character, also the composing
  characters, as hex numbers.
- ":set encoding=utf-8 fileencodings=" forces using UTF-8 for all files.  The
  default is to use the current locale for 'encoding' and set 'fileencodings'
  to automatically detect the encoding of a file.


STARTING VIM

If your current locale is in an utf-8 encoding, Vim will automatically start
in utf-8 mode.

If you are using another locale: >

	set encoding=utf-8

You might also want to select the font used for the menus.  Unfortunately this
doesn't always work.  See the system specific remarks below, and 'langmenu'.


USING UTF-8 IN X-Windows				*utf-8-in-xwindows*

Note: This section does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.

You need to specify a font to be used.  For double-wide characters another
font is required, which is exactly twice as wide.  There are three ways to do
this:

1. Set 'guifont' and let Vim find a matching 'guifontwide'
2. Set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'
3. Set 'guifontset'

See the documentation for each option for details.  Example: >

   :set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

You might also want to set the font used for the menus.  This only works for
Motif.  Use the ":hi Menu font={fontname}" command for this. |:highlight|


TYPING UTF-8						*utf-8-typing*

If you are using X-Windows, you should find an input method that supports
utf-8.

If your system does not provide support for typing utf-8, you can use the
'keymap' feature.  This allows writing a keymap file, which defines a utf-8
character as a sequence of ASCII characters.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

Another method is to set the current locale to the language you want to use
and for which you have a XIM available.  Then set 'termencoding' to that
language and Vim will convert the typed characters to 'encoding' for you.

If everything else fails, you can type any character as four hex bytes: >

	CTRL-V u 1234

"1234" is interpreted as a hex number.  You must type four characters, prepend
a zero if necessary.


COMMAND ARGUMENTS					*utf-8-char-arg*

Commands like |f|, |F|, |t| and |r| take an argument of one character.  For
UTF-8 this argument may include one or two composing characters.  These need
to be produced together with the base character, Vim doesn't wait for the next
character to be typed to find out if it is a composing character or not.
Using 'keymap' or |:lmap| is a nice way to type these characters.

The commands that search for a character in a line handle composing characters
as follows.  When searching for a character without a composing character,
this will find matches in the text with or without composing characters.  When
searching for a character with a composing character, this will only find
matches with that composing character.  It was implemented this way, because
not everybody is able to type a composing character.

11. Overview of options					*mbyte-options*

These options are relevant for editing multi-byte files.  Check the help in
options.txt for detailed information.

'encoding'	Encoding used for the keyboard and display.  It is also the
		default encoding for files.

'fileencoding'	Encoding of a file.  When it's different from 'encoding'
		conversion is done when reading or writing the file.

'fileencodings'	List of possible encodings of a file.  When opening a file
		these will be tried and the first one that doesn't cause an
		error is used for 'fileencoding'.

'charconvert'	Expression used to convert files from one encoding to another.

'formatoptions' The 'm' flag can be included to have formatting break a line
		at a multibyte character of 256 or higher.  Thus is useful for
		languages where a sequence of characters can be broken
		anywhere.

'guifontset'	The list of font names used for a multi-byte encoding.  When
		this option is not empty, it replaces 'guifont'.

'keymap'	Specify the name of a keyboard mapping.

Last change: 2013 Feb 23


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file contains an alphabetical list of messages and error messages that
Vim produces.  You can use this if you don't understand what the message
means.  It is not complete though.

1. Old messages		|:messages|
2. Error messages	|error-messages|
3. Messages		|messages|

==============================================================================
1. Old messages			*:messages* *:mes* *message-history*

The ":messages" command can be used to view previously given messages.  This
is especially useful when messages have been overwritten or truncated.  This
depends on the 'shortmess' option.

The number of remembered messages is fixed at 20 for the tiny version and 200
for other versions.

								*g<*
The "g<" command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter
prompt.  You are then back at the hit-enter prompt and can then scroll further
back.
Note: If the output has been stopped with "q" at the more prompt, it will only
be displayed up to this point.
The previous command output is cleared when another command produces output.

If you are using translated messages, the first printed line tells who
maintains the messages or the translations.  You can use this to contact the
maintainer when you spot a mistake.

If you want to find help on a specific (error) message, use the ID at the
start of the message.  For example, to get help on the message: >

	E72: Close error on swap file

or (translated): >

	E72: Errore durante chiusura swap file

Use: >

	:help E72

If you are lazy, it also works without the shift key: >

	:help e72

==============================================================================
2. Error messages				*error-messages* *errors*

When an error message is displayed, but it is removed before you could read
it, you can see it again with: >
  :echo errmsg
or view a list of recent messages with: >
  :messages

This is an internal error.  If you can reproduce it, please send in a bug
report. |bugs|

>
  ATTENTION
  Found a swap file by the name ...

See |ATTENTION|.

							*E92*  >
  Buffer {N} not found

The buffer you requested does not exist.  This can also happen when you have
wiped out a buffer which contains a mark or is referenced in another way.
|:bwipeout|

							*E95*  >
  Buffer with this name already exists

You cannot have two buffers with the same name.

							*E72*  >
  Close error on swap file

The |swap-file|, that is used to keep a copy of the edited text, could not be
closed properly.  Mostly harmless.

							*E169*  >
  Command too recursive

This happens when an Ex command executes an Ex command that executes an Ex
command, etc.  This is only allowed 200 times.  When it's more there probably
is an endless loop.  Probably a |:execute| or |:source| command is involved.

							*E254*  >
  Cannot allocate color {name}

The color name {name} is unknown.  See |gui-colors| for a list of colors that
are available on most systems.

							*E458*  >
  Cannot allocate colormap entry, some colors may be incorrect

This means that there are not enough colors available for Vim.  It will still
run, but some of the colors will not appear in the specified color.  Try
stopping other applications that use many colors, or start them after starting
gvim.
Browsers are known to consume a lot of colors.  You can avoid this with
netscape by telling it to use its own colormap: >
	netscape -install
Or tell it to limit to a certain number of colors (64 should work well): >
	netscape -ncols 64
This can also be done with a line in your Xdefaults file: >
	Netscape*installColormap: Yes
or >
	Netscape*maxImageColors:  64
<
							*E79*  >
  Cannot expand wildcards

A filename contains a strange combination of characters, which causes Vim to
attempt expanding wildcards but this fails.  This does NOT mean that no
matching file names could be found, but that the pattern was illegal.

							*E459*  >
  Cannot go back to previous directory

While expanding a file name, Vim failed to go back to the previously used
directory.  All file names being used may be invalid now!  You need to have
execute permission on the current directory.

							*E190* *E212*  >
  Cannot open "{filename}" for writing
  Can't open file for writing

For some reason the file you are writing to cannot be created or overwritten.
The reason could be that you do not have permission to write in the directory
or the file name is not valid.

							*E166*  >
  Can't open linked file for writing

You are trying to write to a file which can't be overwritten, and the file is
a link (either a hard link or a symbolic link).  Writing might still be
possible if the directory that contains the link or the file is writable, but
Vim now doesn't know if you want to delete the link and write the file in its
place, or if you want to delete the file itself and write the new file in its
place.  If you really want to write the file under this name, you have to
manually delete the link or the file, or change the permissions so that Vim
can overwrite.

							*E46*  >
  Cannot change read-only variable "{name}"

You are trying to assign a value to an argument of a function |a:var| or a Vim
internal variable |v:var| which is read-only.

							*E90*  >
  Cannot unload last buffer

Vim always requires one buffer to be loaded, otherwise there would be nothing
to display in the window.

							*E40*  >
  Can't open errorfile <filename>

When using the ":make" or ":grep" commands: The file used to save the error
messages or grep output cannot be opened.  This can have several causes:
- 'shellredir' has a wrong value.
- The shell changes directory, causing the error file to be written in another
  directory.  This could be fixed by changing 'makeef', but then the make
  command is still executed in the wrong directory.
- 'makeef' has a wrong value.
- The 'grepprg' or 'makeprg' could not be executed.  This cannot always be
  detected (especially on MS-Windows).  Check your $PATH.

 >
  Can't open file C:\TEMP\VIoD243.TMP

On MS-Windows, this message appears when the output of an external command was
to be read, but the command didn't run successfully.  This can be caused by
many things.  Check the 'shell', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote', 'shellslash' and
related options.  It might also be that the external command was not found,
there is no different error message for that.

							*E12*  >
  Command not allowed from exrc/vimrc in current dir or tag search

Some commands are not allowed for security reasons.  These commands mostly
come from a .exrc or .vimrc file in the current directory, or from a tags
file.  Also see 'secure'.

							*E74*  >
  Command too complex

A mapping resulted in a very long command string.  Could be caused by a
mapping that indirectly calls itself.

>
  CONVERSION ERROR

When writing a file and the text "CONVERSION ERROR" appears, this means that
some bits were lost when converting text from the internally used UTF-8 to the
format of the file.  The file will not be marked unmodified.  If you care
about the loss of information, set the 'fileencoding' option to another value
that can handle the characters in the buffer and write again.  If you don't
care, you can abandon the buffer or reset the 'modified' option.

							*E302*  >
  Could not rename swap file

When the file name changes, Vim tries to rename the |swap-file| as well.
This failed and the old swap file is now still used.  Mostly harmless.

							*E43* *E44*  >
  Damaged match string
  Corrupted regexp program

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a corrupted regexp.  If you
know how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E208* *E209* *E210*  >
  Error writing to "{filename}"
  Error closing "{filename}"
  Error reading "{filename}"

This occurs when Vim is trying to rename a file, but a simple change of file
name doesn't work.  Then the file will be copied, but somehow this failed.
The result may be that both the original file and the destination file exist
and the destination file may be incomplete.

>
  Vim: Error reading input, exiting...

This occurs when Vim cannot read typed characters while input is required.
Vim got stuck, the only thing it can do is exit.  This can happen when both
stdin and stderr are redirected and executing a script that doesn't exit Vim.

							*E47*  >
  Error while reading errorfile

Reading the error file was not possible.  This is NOT caused by an error
message that was not recognized.

							*E80*  >
  Error while writing

Writing a file was not completed successfully.  The file is probably
incomplete.

							*E13* *E189*  >
  File exists (add ! to override)
  "{filename}" exists (add ! to override)

You are protected from accidentally overwriting a file.  When you want to
write anyway, use the same command, but add a "!" just after the command.
Example: >
	:w /tmp/test
changes to: >
	:w! /tmp/test
<
							*E768*  >
  Swap file exists: {filename} (:silent! overrides)

You are protected from overwriting a file that is being edited by Vim.  This
happens when you use ":w! filename" and a swapfile is found.
- If the swapfile was left over from an old crashed edit session you may want
  to delete the swapfile.  Edit {filename} to find out information about the
  swapfile.
- If you want to write anyway prepend ":silent!" to the command.  For example: >
	:silent! w! /tmp/test
< The special command is needed, since you already added the ! for overwriting
  an existing file.

							*E139*  >
  File is loaded in another buffer

You are trying to write a file under a name which is also used in another
buffer.  This would result in two versions of the same file.

							*E142*  >
  File not written: Writing is disabled by 'write' option

The 'write' option is off.  This makes all commands that try to write a file
generate this message.  This could be caused by a |-m| commandline argument.
You can switch the 'write' option on with ":set write".

							*E25*  >
  GUI cannot be used: Not enabled at compile time

You are running a version of Vim that doesn't include the GUI code.  Therefore
"gvim" and ":gui" don't work.

							*E49*  >
  Invalid scroll size

This is caused by setting an invalid value for the 'scroll', 'scrolljump' or
'scrolloff' options.

							*E17*  >
  "{filename}" is a directory

You tried to write a file with the name of a directory.  This is not possible.
You probably need to append a file name.

							*E19*  >
  Mark has invalid line number

You are using a mark that has a line number that doesn't exist.  This can
happen when you have a mark in another file, and some other program has
deleted lines from it.

							*E219* *E220*  >
  Missing {.
  Missing }.

Using a {} construct in a file name, but there is a { without a matching } or
the other way around.  It should be used like this: {foo,bar}.  This matches
"foo" and "bar".

							*E315*  >
  ml_get: invalid lnum: {number}

This is an internal Vim error.  Please try to find out how it can be
reproduced, and submit a bug report |bugreport.vim|.

							*E173*  >
  {number} more files to edit

You are trying to exit, while the last item in the argument list has not been
edited.  This protects you from accidentally exiting when you still have more
files to work on.  See |argument-list|.  If you do want to exit, just do it
again and it will work.

							*E23* *E194*  >
  No alternate file
  No alternate file name to substitute for '#'

The alternate file is not defined yet.  See |alternate-file|.

							*E32*  >
  No file name

The current buffer has no name.  To write it, use ":w fname".  Or give the
buffer a name with ":file fname".

							*E141*  >
  No file name for buffer {number}

One of the buffers that was changed does not have a file name.  Therefore it
cannot be written.  You need to give the buffer a file name: >
	:buffer {number}
	:file {filename}
<
							*E33*  >
  No previous substitute regular expression

When using the '~' character in a pattern, it is replaced with the previously
used pattern in a ":substitute" command.  This fails when no such command has
been used yet.  See |/~|.  This also happens when using ":s/pat/%/", where the
"%" stands for the previous substitute string.

							*E35*  >
  No previous regular expression

When using an empty search pattern, the previous search pattern is used.  But
that is not possible if there was no previous search.

							*E24*  >
  No such abbreviation

You have used an ":unabbreviate" command with an argument which is not an
existing abbreviation.  All variations of this command give the same message:
":cunabbrev", ":iunabbrev", etc.  Check for trailing white space.

>
  /dev/dsp: No such file or directory

Only given for GTK GUI with Gnome support.  Gnome tries to use the audio
device and it isn't present.  You can ignore this error.

							*E31*  >
  No such mapping

You have used an ":unmap" command with an argument which is not an existing
mapping.  All variations of this command give the same message: ":cunmap",
":unmap!", etc.  A few hints:
- Check for trailing white space.
- If the mapping is buffer-local you need to use ":unmap <buffer>".
  |:map-<buffer>|

							*E37* *E89*  >
  No write since last change (add ! to override)
  No write since last change for buffer {N} (add ! to override)

You are trying to |abandon| a file that has changes.  Vim protects you from
losing your work.  You can either write the changed file with ":w", or, if you
are sure, |abandon| it anyway, and lose all the changes.  This can be done by
adding a '!' character just after the command you used.  Example: >
	:e other_file
changes to: >
	:e! other_file
<
							*E162*  >
  No write since last change for buffer "{name}"

This appears when you try to exit Vim while some buffers are changed.  You
will either have to write the changed buffer (with |:w|), or use a command to
abandon the buffer forcefully, e.g., with ":qa!".  Careful, make sure you
don't throw away changes you really want to keep.  You might have forgotten
about a buffer, especially when 'hidden' is set.

>
  [No write since last change]

This appears when executing a shell command while at least one buffer was
changed.  To avoid the message reset the 'warn' option.

							*E38*  >
  Null argument

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a NULL pointer.  If you know
how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E172*  >
  Only one file name allowed

The ":edit" command only accepts one file name.  When you want to specify
several files for editing use ":next" |:next|.

						*E41* *E82* *E83* *E342*  >
  Out of memory!
  Out of memory!  (allocating {number} bytes)
  Cannot allocate any buffer, exiting...
  Cannot allocate buffer, using other one...

Oh, oh.  You must have been doing something complicated, or some other program
is consuming your memory.  Be careful!  Vim is not completely prepared for an
out-of-memory situation.  First make sure that any changes are saved.  Then
try to solve the memory shortage.  To stay on the safe side, exit Vim and
start again.

Buffers are only partly kept in memory, thus editing a very large file is
unlikely to cause an out-of-memory situation.  Undo information is completely
in memory, you can reduce that with these options:
- 'undolevels'  Set to a low value, or to -1 to disable undo completely.  This
  helps for a change that affects all lines.
- 'undoreload' Set to zero to disable.

Also see |msdos-limitations|.

							*E339*  >
  Pattern too long

This happens on systems with 16 bit ints: The compiled regexp pattern is
longer than about 65000 characters.  Try using a shorter pattern.
It also happens when the offset of a rule doesn't fit in the space available.
Try simplifying the pattern.

							*E45*  >
  'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)

You are trying to write a file that was marked as read-only.  To write the
file anyway, either reset the 'readonly' option, or add a '!' character just
after the command you used.  Example: >
	:w
changes to: >
	:w!
<
							*E294* *E295* *E301*  >
  Read error in swap file
  Seek error in swap file read
  Oops, lost the swap file!!!

Vim tried to read text from the |swap-file|, but something went wrong.  The
text in the related buffer may now be corrupted!  Check carefully before you
write a buffer.  You may want to write it in another file and check for
differences.

							*E192*  >
  Recursive use of :normal too deep

You are using a ":normal" command, whose argument again uses a ":normal"
command in a recursive way.  This is restricted to 'maxmapdepth' levels.  This
example illustrates how to get this message: >
	:map gq :normal gq<CR>
If you type "gq", it will execute this mapping, which will call "gq" again.

							*E22*  >
  Scripts nested too deep

Scripts can be read with the "-s" command-line argument and with the ":source"
command.  The script can then again read another script.  This can continue
for about 14 levels.  When more nesting is done, Vim assumes that there is a
recursive loop somewhere and stops with this error message.

							*E319*  >
  Sorry, the command is not available in this version

You have used a command that is not present in the version of Vim you are
using.  When compiling Vim, many different features can be enabled or
disabled.  This depends on how big Vim has chosen to be and the operating
system.  See |+feature-list| for when which feature is available.  The
|:version| command shows which feature Vim was compiled with.

							*E300*  >
  Swap file already exists (symlink attack?)

This message appears when Vim is trying to open a swap file and finds it
already exists or finds a symbolic link in its place.  This shouldn't happen,
because Vim already checked that the file doesn't exist.  Either someone else
opened the same file at exactly the same moment (very unlikely) or someone is
attempting a symlink attack (could happen when editing a file in /tmp or when
'directory' starts with "/tmp", which is a bad choice).

							*E432*  >
  Tags file not sorted: {file name}

Vim (and Vi) expect tags files to be sorted in ASCII order.  Binary searching
can then be used, which is a lot faster than a linear search.  If your tags
files are not properly sorted, reset the |'tagbsearch'| option.
This message is only given when Vim detects a problem when searching for a
tag.  Sometimes this message is not given, even though the tags file is not
properly sorted.

							*E460*  >
  The resource fork would be lost (add ! to override)

On the Macintosh (classic), when writing a file, Vim attempts to preserve all
info about a file, including its resource fork.  If this is not possible you
get this error message.  Append "!" to the command name to write anyway (and
lose the info).

							*E424*  >
  Too many different highlighting attributes in use

Vim can only handle about 223 different kinds of highlighting.  If you run
into this limit, you have used too many |:highlight| commands with different
arguments.  A ":highlight link" is not counted.

							*E77*  >
  Too many file names

When expanding file names, more than one match was found.  Only one match is
allowed for the command that was used.

							*E303*  >
  Unable to open swap file for "{filename}", recovery impossible

Vim was not able to create a swap file.  You can still edit the file, but if
Vim unexpectedly exits the changes will be lost.  And Vim may consume a lot of
memory when editing a big file.  You may want to change the 'directory' option
to avoid this error.  See |swap-file|.

							*E140*  >
  Use ! to write partial buffer

When using a range to write part of a buffer, it is unusual to overwrite the
original file.  It is probably a mistake (e.g., when Visual mode was active
when using ":w"), therefore Vim requires using a !  after the command, e.g.:
":3,10w!".
>

  Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>Escape,_Key_Cancel" to type

							*W10*  >
  Warning: Changing a readonly file

The file is read-only and you are making a change to it anyway.  You can use
the |FileChangedRO| autocommand event to avoid this message (the autocommand
must reset the 'readonly' option).  See 'modifiable' to completely disallow
making changes to a file.
This message is only given for the first change after 'readonly' has been set.

							*W13*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has been created after editing started

You are editing a file in Vim when it didn't exist, but it does exist now.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in Vim or the newly
created file.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W11*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed since editing started

The file which you have started editing has got another timestamp and the
contents changed (more precisely: When reading the file again with the current
option settings and autocommands you would end up with different text).  This
probably means that some other program changed the file.  You will have to
find out what happened, and decide which version of the file you want to keep.
Set the 'autoread' option if you want to do this automatically.
This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

There is one situation where you get this message even though there is nothing
wrong: If you save a file in Windows on the day the daylight saving time
starts.  It can be fixed in one of these ways:
- Add this line in your autoexec.bat: >
	   SET TZ=-1
< Adjust the "-1" for your time zone.
- Disable "automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes".
- Just write the file again the next day.  Or set your clock to the next day,
  write the file twice and set the clock back.

							*W12*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed and the buffer was changed in Vim as well

Like the above, and the buffer for the file was changed in this Vim as well.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in this Vim or the one
on disk.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W16*  >
  Warning: Mode of file "{filename}" has changed since editing started

When the timestamp for a buffer was changed and the contents are still the
same but the mode (permissions) have changed.  This usually occurs when
checking out a file from a version control system, which causes the read-only
bit to be reset.  It should be safe to reload the file.  Set 'autoread' to
automatically reload the file.

							*E211*  >
  File "{filename}" no longer available

The file which you have started editing has disappeared, or is no longer
accessible.  Make sure you write the buffer somewhere to avoid losing
changes.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W14*  >
  Warning: List of file names overflow

You must be using an awful lot of buffers.  It's now possible that two buffers
have the same number, which causes various problems.  You might want to exit
Vim and restart it.

							*E296* *E297*  >
  Seek error in swap file write
  Write error in swap file

This mostly happens when the disk is full.  Vim could not write text into the
|swap-file|.  It's not directly harmful, but when Vim unexpectedly exits some
text may be lost without recovery being possible.  Vim might run out of memory
when this problem persists.

						*connection-refused*  >
  Xlib: connection to "<machine-name:0.0" refused by server

This happens when Vim tries to connect to the X server, but the X server does
not allow a connection.  The connection to the X server is needed to be able
to restore the title and for the xterm clipboard support.  Unfortunately this
error message cannot be avoided, except by disabling the |+xterm_clipboard|
and |+X11| features.

							*E10*  >
  \\ should be followed by /, ? or &

A command line started with a backslash or the range of a command contained a
backslash in a wrong place.  This is often caused by command-line continuation
being disabled.  Remove the 'C' flag from the 'cpoptions' option to enable it.
Or use ":set nocp".

							*E471*  >
  Argument required

This happens when an Ex command with mandatory argument(s) was executed, but
no argument has been specified.

							*E474* *E475*  >
  Invalid argument
  Invalid argument: {arg}

An Ex command has been executed, but an invalid argument has been specified.

							*E488*  >
  Trailing characters

An argument has been added to an Ex command that does not permit one.

							*E477* *E478*  >
  No ! allowed
  Don't panic!

You have added a "!" after an Ex command that doesn't permit one.

							*E481*  >
  No range allowed

A range was specified for an Ex command that doesn't permit one.  See
|cmdline-ranges|.

							*E482* *E483*  >
  Can't create file {filename}
  Can't get temp file name

Vim cannot create a temporary file.

							*E484* *E485*  >
  Can't open file {filename}
  Can't read file {filename}

Vim cannot read a temporary file.  Especially on Windows, this can be caused
by wrong escaping of special characters for cmd.exe; the approach was
changed with patch 7.3.443.  Try using |shellescape()| for all shell arguments
given to |system()|, or explicitly add escaping with ^.  Also see
'shellxquote' and 'shellxescape'.

							*E464*  >
  Ambiguous use of user-defined command

There are two user-defined commands with a common name prefix, and you used
Command-line completion to execute one of them. |user-cmd-ambiguous|
Example: >
	:command MyCommand1 echo "one"
	:command MyCommand2 echo "two"
	:MyCommand
<
							*E492*  >
  Not an editor command

You tried to execute a command that is neither an Ex command nor
a user-defined command.

==============================================================================
3. Messages						*messages*

This is an (incomplete) overview of various messages that Vim gives:

			*hit-enter* *press-enter* *hit-return*
			*press-return* *hit-enter-prompt*

  Press ENTER or type command to continue

This message is given when there is something on the screen for you to read,
and the screen is about to be redrawn:
- After executing an external command (e.g., ":!ls" and "=").
- Something is displayed on the status line that is longer than the width of
  the window, or runs into the 'showcmd' or 'ruler' output.

-> Press <Enter> or <Space> to redraw the screen and continue, without that
   key being used otherwise.
-> Press ':' or any other Normal mode command character to start that command.
-> Press 'k', <Up>, 'u', 'b' or 'g' to scroll back in the messages.  This
   works the same way as at the |more-prompt|.  Only works when 'compatible'
   is off and 'more' is on.
-> Pressing 'j', 'f', 'd' or <Down> is ignored when messages scrolled off the
   top of the screen, 'compatible' is off and 'more' is on, to avoid that
   typing one 'j' or 'f' too many causes the messages to disappear.
-> Press <C-Y> to copy (yank) a modeless selection to the clipboard register.
-> Use a menu.  The characters defined for Cmdline-mode are used.
-> When 'mouse' contains the 'r' flag, clicking the left mouse button works
   like pressing <Space>.  This makes it impossible to select text though.
-> For the GUI clicking the left mouse button in the last line works like
   pressing <Space>.
{Vi: only ":" commands are interpreted}

If you accidentally hit <Enter> or <Space> and you want to see the displayed
text then use |g<|.  This only works when 'more' is set.

To reduce the number of hit-enter prompts:
- Set 'cmdheight' to 2 or higher.
- Add flags to 'shortmess'.
- Reset 'showcmd' and/or 'ruler'.

If your script causes the hit-enter prompt and you don't know why, you may
find the |v:scrollstart| variable useful.

Also see 'mouse'.  The hit-enter message is highlighted with the |hl-Question|
group.


						*more-prompt* *pager*  >
  -- More --
  -- More -- SPACE/d/j: screen/page/line down, b/u/k: up, q: quit

This message is given when the screen is filled with messages.  It is only
given when the 'more' option is on.  It is highlighted with the |hl-MoreMsg|
group.

Type					effect ~
     <CR> or <NL> or j or <Down>	one more line
     d					down a page (half a screen)
     <Space> or f or <PageDown>		down a screen
     G					down all the way, until the hit-enter
					prompt

     <BS> or k or <Up>			one line back (*)
     u					up a page (half a screen) (*)
     b or <PageUp>			back a screen (*)
     g					back to the start (*)

     q, <Esc> or CTRL-C			stop the listing
     :					stop the listing and enter a
					     command-line
    <C-Y>				yank (copy) a modeless selection to
					the clipboard ("* and "+ registers)
    {menu-entry}			what the menu is defined to in
					Cmdline-mode.
    <LeftMouse> (**)			next page

Any other key causes the meaning of the keys to be displayed.

(*)  backwards scrolling is {not in Vi}.  Only scrolls back to where messages
     started to scroll.
(**) Clicking the left mouse button only works:
     - For the GUI: in the last line of the screen.
     - When 'r' is included in 'mouse' (but then selecting text won't work).


Note: The typed key is directly obtained from the terminal, it is not mapped
and typeahead is ignored.

The |g<| command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter
prompt.

Last change: 2012 Jan 15


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Multi-language features				*multilang* *multi-lang*

This is about using messages and menus in various languages.  For editing
multi-byte text see |multibyte|.

The basics are explained in the user manual: |usr_45.txt|.

1. Messages			|multilang-messages|
2. Menus			|multilang-menus|
3. Scripts			|multilang-scripts|

Also see |help-translated| for multi-language help.

{Vi does not have any of these features}
{not available when compiled without the |+multi_lang| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Messages						*multilang-messages*

Vim picks up the locale from the environment.  In most cases this means Vim
will use the language that you prefer, unless it's not available.

To see a list of supported locale names on your system, look in one of these
directories (for Unix):
	/usr/lib/locale ~
	/usr/share/locale ~
Unfortunately, upper/lowercase differences matter.  Also watch out for the
use of "-" and "_".

					    *:lan* *:lang* *:language* *E197*
:lan[guage]
:lan[guage] mes[sages]
:lan[guage] cty[pe]
:lan[guage] tim[e]
			Print the current language (aka locale).
			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is printed.  Technical: LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is printed.  Technical: LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for
			strftime() is printed.  Technical: LC_TIME.
			Without argument all parts of the locale are printed
			(this is system dependent).
			The current language can also be obtained with the
			|v:lang|, |v:ctype| and |v:lc_time| variables.

:lan[guage] {name}
:lan[guage] mes[sages] {name}
:lan[guage] cty[pe] {name}
:lan[guage] tim[e] {name}
			Set the current language (aka locale) to {name}.
			The locale {name} must be a valid locale on your
			system.  Some systems accept aliases like "en" or
			"en_US", but some only accept the full specification
			like "en_US.ISO_8859-1".  On Unix systems you can use
			this command to see what locales are supported: >
				:!locale -a
<			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is set.  This can be different when you want,
			for example, English messages while editing Japanese
			text.  This sets $LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is set.  This affects the libraries
			that Vim was linked with.  It's unusual to set this to
			a different value from 'encoding' or "C".  This sets
			$LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for time
			and date messages is set.  This affects strftime().
			This sets $LC_TIME.
			Without an argument both are set, and additionally
			$LANG is set.
			When compiled with the |+float| feature the LC_NUMERIC
			value will always be set to "C", so that floating
			point numbers use '.' as the decimal point.
			This will make a difference for items that depend on
			the language (some messages, time and date format).
			Not fully supported on all systems
			If this fails there will be an error message.  If it
			succeeds there is no message.  Example: >
				:language
				Current language: C
				:language de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:language mes
				Current messages language: de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:lang mes en
<

MS-WINDOWS MESSAGE TRANSLATIONS				*win32-gettext*

If you used the self-installing .exe file, message translations should work
already.  Otherwise get the libintl.dll file if you don't have it yet:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext

This also contains tools xgettext, msgformat and others.

libintl.dll should be placed in same directory with (g)vim.exe, or some
place where PATH environment value describe.  Message files (vim.mo)
have to be placed in "$VIMRUNTIME/lang/xx/LC_MESSAGES", where "xx" is the
abbreviation of the language (mostly two letters).

If you write your own translations you need to generate the .po file and
convert it to a .mo file.  You need to get the source distribution and read
the file "src/po/README.txt".

To overrule the automatic choice of the language, set the $LANG variable to
the language of your choice.  use "en" to disable translations. >

  :let $LANG = 'ja'

(text for Windows by Muraoka Taro)

==============================================================================
2. Menus						*multilang-menus*

See |45.2| for the basics, esp. using 'langmenu'.

Note that if changes have been made to the menus after the translation was
done, some of the menus may be shown in English.  Please try contacting the
maintainer of the translation and ask him to update it.  You can find the
name and e-mail address of the translator in
"$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_<lang>.vim".

To set the font (or fontset) to use for the menus, use the |:highlight|
command.  Example: >

	:highlight Menu font=k12,r12


ALIAS LOCALE NAMES

Unfortunately, the locale names are different on various systems, even though
they are for the same language and encoding.  If you do not get the menu
translations you expected, check the output of this command: >

	echo v:lang

Now check the "$VIMRUNTIME/lang" directory for menu translation files that use
a similar language.  A difference in a "-" being a "_" already causes a file
not to be found!  Another common difference to watch out for is "iso8859-1"
versus "iso_8859-1".  Fortunately Vim makes all names lowercase, thus you
don't have to worry about case differences.  Spaces are changed to
underscores, to avoid having to escape them.

If you find a menu translation file for your language with a different name,
create a file in your own runtime directory to load that one.  The name of
that file could be: >

	~/.vim/lang/menu_<v:lang>.vim

Check the 'runtimepath' option for directories which are searched.  In that
file put a command to load the menu file with the other name: >

	runtime lang/menu_<other_lang>.vim


TRANSLATING MENUS

If you want to do your own translations, you can use the |:menutrans| command,
explained below.  It is recommended to put the translations for one language
in a Vim script.  For a language that has no translation yet, please consider
becoming the maintainer and make your translations available to all Vim users.
Send an e-mail to the Vim maintainer <maintainer@vim.org>.

					*:menut* *:menutrans* *:menutranslate*
:menut[ranslate] clear
			Clear all menu translations.

:menut[ranslate] {english} {mylang}
			Translate menu name {english} to {mylang}.  All
			special characters like "&" and "<Tab>" need to be
			included.  Spaces and dots need to be escaped with a
			backslash, just like in other |:menu| commands.

See the $VIMRUNTIME/lang directory for examples.

To try out your translations you first have to remove all menus.  This is how
you can do it without restarting Vim: >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
	:source <your-new-menu-file>
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim

Each part of a menu path is translated separately.  The result is that when
"Help" is translated to "Hilfe" and "Overview" to "berblick" then
"Help.Overview" will be translated to "Hilfe.berblick".

==============================================================================
3. Scripts						*multilang-scripts*

In Vim scripts you can use the |v:lang| variable to get the current language
(locale).  The default value is "C" or comes from the $LANG environment
variable.

The following example shows how this variable is used in a simple way, to make
a message adapt to language preferences of the user, >

	:if v:lang =~ "de_DE"
	:  echo "Guten Morgen"
	:else
	:  echo "Good morning"
	:endif
<

Last change: 2014 Feb 11


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Cursor motions					*cursor-motions* *navigation*

These commands move the cursor position.  If the new position is off of the
screen, the screen is scrolled to show the cursor (see also 'scrolljump' and
'scrolloff' options).

1. Motions and operators	|operator|
2. Left-right motions		|left-right-motions|
3. Up-down motions		|up-down-motions|
4. Word motions			|word-motions|
5. Text object motions		|object-motions|
6. Text object selection	|object-select|
7. Marks			|mark-motions|
8. Jumps			|jump-motions|
9. Various motions		|various-motions|

General remarks:

If you want to know where you are in the file use the "CTRL-G" command
|CTRL-G| or the "g CTRL-G" command |g_CTRL-G|.  If you set the 'ruler' option,
the cursor position is continuously shown in the status line (which slows down
Vim a little).

Experienced users prefer the hjkl keys because they are always right under
their fingers.  Beginners often prefer the arrow keys, because they do not
know what the hjkl keys do.  The mnemonic value of hjkl is clear from looking
at the keyboard.  Think of j as an arrow pointing downwards.

The 'virtualedit' option can be set to make it possible to move the cursor to
positions where there is no character or halfway a character.

==============================================================================
1. Motions and operators				*operator*

The motion commands can be used after an operator command, to have the command
operate on the text that was moved over.  That is the text between the cursor
position before and after the motion.  Operators are generally used to delete
or change text.  The following operators are available:

	|c|	c	change
	|d|	d	delete
	|y|	y	yank into register (does not change the text)
	|~|	~	swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set)
	|g~|	g~	swap case
	|gu|	gu	make lowercase
	|gU|	gU	make uppercase
	|!|	!	filter through an external program
	|=|	=	filter through 'equalprg' or C-indenting if empty
	|gq|	gq	text formatting
	|g?|	g?	ROT13 encoding
	|>|	>	shift right
	|<|	<	shift left
	|zf|	zf	define a fold
	|g@|	g@	call function set with the 'operatorfunc' option

If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it,
the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.

After applying the operator the cursor is mostly left at the start of the text
that was operated upon.  For example, "yfe" doesn't move the cursor, but "yFe"
moves the cursor leftwards to the "e" where the yank started.

						*linewise* *characterwise*
The operator either affects whole lines, or the characters between the start
and end position.  Generally, motions that move between lines affect lines
(are linewise), and motions that move within a line affect characters (are
characterwise).  However, there are some exceptions.

						*exclusive* *inclusive*
A character motion is either inclusive or exclusive.  When inclusive, the
start and end position of the motion are included in the operation.  When
exclusive, the last character towards the end of the buffer is not included.
Linewise motions always include the start and end position.

Which motions are linewise, inclusive or exclusive is mentioned with the
command.  There are however, two general exceptions:
1. If the motion is exclusive and the end of the motion is in column 1, the
   end of the motion is moved to the end of the previous line and the motion
   becomes inclusive.  Example: "}" moves to the first line after a paragraph,
   but "d}" will not include that line.
						*exclusive-linewise*
2. If the motion is exclusive, the end of the motion is in column 1 and the
   start of the motion was at or before the first non-blank in the line, the
   motion becomes linewise.  Example: If a paragraph begins with some blanks
   and you do "d}" while standing on the first non-blank, all the lines of
   the paragraph are deleted, including the blanks.  If you do a put now, the
   deleted lines will be inserted below the cursor position.

Note that when the operator is pending (the operator command is typed, but the
motion isn't yet), a special set of mappings can be used.  See |:omap|.

Instead of first giving the operator and then a motion you can use Visual
mode: mark the start of the text with "v", move the cursor to the end of the
text that is to be affected and then hit the operator.  The text between the
start and the cursor position is highlighted, so you can see what text will
be operated upon.  This allows much more freedom, but requires more key
strokes and has limited redo functionality.  See the chapter on Visual mode
|Visual-mode|.

You can use a ":" command for a motion.  For example "d:call FindEnd()".
But this can't be repeated with "." if the command is more than one line.
This can be repeated: >
	d:call search("f")<CR>
This cannot be repeated: >
	d:if 1<CR>
	   call search("f")<CR>
	endif<CR>
Note that when using ":" any motion becomes characterwise exclusive.


FORCING A MOTION TO BE LINEWISE, CHARACTERWISE OR BLOCKWISE

When a motion is not of the type you would like to use, you can force another
type by using "v", "V" or CTRL-V just after the operator.
Example: >
	dj
deletes two lines >
	dvj
deletes from the cursor position until the character below the cursor >
	d<C-V>j
deletes the character under the cursor and the character below the cursor. >

Be careful with forcing a linewise movement to be used characterwise or
blockwise, the column may not always be defined.

							*o_v*
v		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work characterwise, also when the motion is
		linewise.  If the motion was linewise, it will become
		|exclusive|.
		If the motion already was characterwise, toggle
		inclusive/exclusive.  This can be used to make an exclusive
		motion inclusive and an inclusive motion exclusive.

							*o_V*
V		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work linewise, also when the motion is
		characterwise.

							*o_CTRL-V*
CTRL-V		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work blockwise.  This works like Visual block
		mode selection, with the corners defined by the cursor
		position before and after the motion.

2. Left-right motions					*left-right-motions*

These commands move the cursor to the specified column in the current line.
They stop at the first column and at the end of the line, except "$", which
may move to one of the next lines.  See 'whichwrap' option to make some of the
commands move across line boundaries.

h		or					*h*
<Left>		or					*<Left>*
CTRL-H		or					*CTRL-H* *<BS>*
<BS>			[count] characters to the left.  |exclusive| motion.
			Note: If you prefer <BS> to delete a character, use
			the mapping:
				:map CTRL-V<BS>		X
			(to enter "CTRL-V<BS>" type the CTRL-V key, followed
			by the <BS> key)
			See |:fixdel| if the <BS> key does not do what you
			want.

l		or					*l*
<Right>		or					*<Right>* *<Space>*
<Space>			[count] characters to the right.  |exclusive| motion.

							*0*
0			To the first character of the line.  |exclusive|
			motion.

							*<Home>* *<kHome>*
<Home>			To the first character of the line.  |exclusive|
			motion.  When moving up or down next, stay in same
			TEXT column (if possible).  Most other commands stay
			in the same SCREEN column.  <Home> works like "1|",
			which differs from "0" when the line starts with a
			<Tab>.  {not in Vi}

							*^*
^			To the first non-blank character of the line.
			|exclusive| motion.

							*$* *<End>* *<kEnd>*
$  or <End>		To the end of the line.  When a count is given also go
			[count - 1] lines downward |inclusive|.
			In Visual mode the cursor goes to just after the last
			character in the line.
			When 'virtualedit' is active, "$" may move the cursor
			back from past the end of the line to the last
			character in the line.

							*g_*
g_			To the last non-blank character of the line and
			[count - 1] lines downward |inclusive|. {not in Vi}

							*g0* *g<Home>*
g0 or g<Home>		When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the first character of
			the screen line.  |exclusive| motion.  Differs from
			"0" when a line is wider than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the leftmost
			character of the current line that is on the screen.
			Differs from "0" when the first character of the line
			is not on the screen.  {not in Vi}

							*g^*
g^			When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the first non-blank
			character of the screen line.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from "^" when a line is wider than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the leftmost
			non-blank character of the current line that is on the
			screen.  Differs from "^" when the first non-blank
			character of the line is not on the screen.  {not in
			Vi}

							*gm*
gm			Like "g0", but half a screenwidth to the right (or as
			much as possible). {not in Vi}

							*g$* *g<End>*
g$ or g<End>		When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the last character of
			the screen line and [count - 1] screen lines downward
			|inclusive|.  Differs from "$" when a line is wider
			than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the rightmost
			character of the current line that is visible on the
			screen.  Differs from "$" when the last character of
			the line is not on the screen or when a count is used.
			Additionally, vertical movements keep the column,
			instead of going to the end of the line.
			When 'virtualedit' is enabled moves to the end of the
			screen line.
			{not in Vi}

							*bar*
|			To screen column [count] in the current line.
			|exclusive| motion.  Ceci n'est pas une pipe.

							*f*
f{char}			To [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right.  The
			cursor is placed on {char} |inclusive|.
			{char} can be entered as a digraph |digraph-arg|.
			When 'encoding' is set to Unicode, composing
			characters may be used, see |utf-8-char-arg|.
			|:lmap| mappings apply to {char}.  The CTRL-^ command
			in Insert mode can be used to switch this on/off
			|i_CTRL-^|.

							*F*
F{char}			To the [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.
			The cursor is placed on {char} |exclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*t*
t{char}			Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the
			right.  The cursor is placed on the character left of
			{char} |inclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*T*
T{char}			Till after [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the
			left.  The cursor is placed on the character right of
			{char} |exclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*;*
;			Repeat latest f, t, F or T [count] times. See |cpo-;|

							*,*
,			Repeat latest f, t, F or T in opposite direction
			[count] times. See also |cpo-;|

==============================================================================
3. Up-down motions					*up-down-motions*

k		or					*k*
<Up>		or					*<Up>* *CTRL-P*
CTRL-P			[count] lines upward |linewise|.

j		or					*j*
<Down>		or					*<Down>*
CTRL-J		or					*CTRL-J*
<NL>		or					*<NL>* *CTRL-N*
CTRL-N			[count] lines downward |linewise|.

gk		or					*gk* *g<Up>*
g<Up>			[count] display lines upward.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from 'k' when lines wrap, and when used with
			an operator, because it's not linewise.  {not in Vi}

gj		or					*gj* *g<Down>*
g<Down>			[count] display lines downward.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from 'j' when lines wrap, and when used with
			an operator, because it's not linewise.  {not in Vi}

							*-*
-  <minus>		[count] lines upward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

+		or					*+*
CTRL-M		or					*CTRL-M* *<CR>*
<CR>			[count] lines downward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

							*_*
_  <underscore>		[count] - 1 lines downward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

							*G*
G			Goto line [count], default last line, on the first
			non-blank character |linewise|.  If 'startofline' not
			set, keep the same column.
			G is a one of |jump-motions|.

							*<C-End>*
<C-End>			Goto line [count], default last line, on the last
			character |inclusive|. {not in Vi}

<C-Home>	or					*gg* *<C-Home>*
gg			Goto line [count], default first line, on the first
			non-blank character |linewise|.  If 'startofline' not
			set, keep the same column.

							*:[range]*
:[range]		Set the cursor on the last line number in [range].
			[range] can also be just one line number, e.g., ":1"
			or ":'m".
			In contrast with |G| this command does not modify the
			|jumplist|.
							*N%*
{count}%		Go to {count} percentage in the file, on the first
			non-blank in the line |linewise|.  To compute the new
			line number this formula is used:
			    ({count} * number-of-lines + 99) / 100
			See also 'startofline' option.  {not in Vi}

:[range]go[to] [count]					*:go* *:goto* *go*
[count]go		Go to [count] byte in the buffer.  Default [count] is
			one, start of the file.  When giving [range], the
			last number in it used as the byte count.  End-of-line
			characters are counted depending on the current
			'fileformat' setting.
			Also see the |line2byte()| function, and the 'o'
			option in 'statusline'.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+byte_offset| feature}

These commands move to the specified line.  They stop when reaching the first
or the last line.  The first two commands put the cursor in the same column
(if possible) as it was after the last command that changed the column,
except after the "$" command, then the cursor will be put on the last
character of the line.

If "k", "-" or CTRL-P is used with a [count] and there are less than [count]
lines above the cursor and the 'cpo' option includes the "-" flag it is an
error. |cpo--|.

==============================================================================
4. Word motions						*word-motions*

<S-Right>	or					*<S-Right>* *w*
w			[count] words forward.  |exclusive| motion.

<C-Right>	or					*<C-Right>* *W*
W			[count] WORDS forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*e*
e			Forward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|.
			Does not stop in an empty line.

							*E*
E			Forward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|.
			Does not stop in an empty line.

<S-Left>	or					*<S-Left>* *b*
b			[count] words backward.  |exclusive| motion.

<C-Left>	or					*<C-Left>* *B*
B			[count] WORDS backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*ge*
ge			Backward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|.

							*gE*
gE			Backward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|.

These commands move over words or WORDS.
							*word*
A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a
sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.  An empty line
is also considered to be a word.
							*WORD*
A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
space.  An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.

A sequence of folded lines is counted for one word of a single character.
"w" and "W", "e" and "E" move to the start/end of the first word or WORD after
a range of folded lines.  "b" and "B" move to the start of the first word or
WORD before the fold.

Special case: "cw" and "cW" are treated like "ce" and "cE" if the cursor is
on a non-blank.  This is because "cw" is interpreted as change-word, and a
word does not include the following white space.  {Vi: "cw" when on a blank
followed by other blanks changes only the first blank; this is probably a
bug, because "dw" deletes all the blanks}

Another special case: When using the "w" motion in combination with an
operator and the last word moved over is at the end of a line, the end of
that word becomes the end of the operated text, not the first word in the
next line.

The original Vi implementation of "e" is buggy.  For example, the "e" command
will stop on the first character of a line if the previous line was empty.
But when you use "2e" this does not happen.  In Vim "ee" and "2e" are the
same, which is more logical.  However, this causes a small incompatibility
between Vi and Vim.

==============================================================================
5. Text object motions					*object-motions*

							*(*
(			[count] sentences backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*)*
)			[count] sentences forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*{*
{			[count] paragraphs backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*}*
}			[count] paragraphs forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*]]*
]]			[count] sections forward or to the next '{' in the
			first column.  When used after an operator, then also
			stops below a '}' in the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*][*
][			[count] sections forward or to the next '}' in the
			first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[[*
[[			[count] sections backward or to the previous '{' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[]*
[]			[count] sections backward or to the previous '}' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

These commands move over three kinds of text objects.

							*sentence*
A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the
end of a line, or by a space or tab.  Any number of closing ')', ']', '"'
and ''' characters may appear after the '.', '!' or '?' before the spaces,
tabs or end of line.  A paragraph and section boundary is also a sentence
boundary.
If the 'J' flag is present in 'cpoptions', at least two spaces have to
follow the punctuation mark; <Tab>s are not recognized as white space.
The definition of a sentence cannot be changed.

							*paragraph*
A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.  The default is "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp", which corresponds to
the macros ".IP", ".LP", etc.  (These are nroff macros, so the dot must be in
the first column).  A section boundary is also a paragraph boundary.
Note that a blank line (only containing white space) is NOT a paragraph
boundary.
Also note that this does not include a '{' or '}' in the first column.  When
the '{' flag is in 'cpoptions' then '{' in the first column is used as a
paragraph boundary |posix|.

							*section*
A section begins after a form-feed (<C-L>) in the first column and at each of
a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the
'sections' option.  The default is "SHNHH HUnhsh", which defines a section to
start at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

The "]" and "[" commands stop at the '{' or '}' in the first column.  This is
useful to find the start or end of a function in a C program.  Note that the
first character of the command determines the search direction and the
second character the type of brace found.

If your '{' or '}' are not in the first column, and you would like to use "[["
and "]]" anyway, try these mappings: >
   :map [[ ?{<CR>w99[{
   :map ][ /}<CR>b99]}
   :map ]] j0[[%/{<CR>
   :map [] k$][%?}<CR>
[type these literally, see |<>|]

==============================================================================
6. Text object selection			*object-select* *text-objects*
						*v_a* *v_i*

This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or
after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object
including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner" object
without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner" commands
always select less text than the "a" commands.

These commands are {not in Vi}.
These commands are not available when the |+textobjects| feature has been
disabled at compile time.
Also see `gn` and `gN`, operating on the last search pattern.

							*v_aw* *aw*
aw			"a word", select [count] words (see |word|).
			Leading or trailing white space is included, but not
			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_iw* *iw*
iw			"inner word", select [count] words (see |word|).
			White space between words is counted too.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "iw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_aW* *aW*
aW			"a WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).
			Leading or trailing white space is included, but not
			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aW" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_iW* *iW*
iW			"inner WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).
			White space between words is counted too.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "iW" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_as* *as*
as			"a sentence", select [count] sentences (see
			|sentence|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

							*v_is* *is*
is			"inner sentence", select [count] sentences (see
			|sentence|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

							*v_ap* *ap*
ap			"a paragraph", select [count] paragraphs (see
			|paragraph|).
			Exception: a blank line (only containing white space)
			is also a paragraph boundary.
			When used in Visual mode it is made linewise.

							*v_ip* *ip*
ip			"inner paragraph", select [count] paragraphs (see
			|paragraph|).
			Exception: a blank line (only containing white space)
			is also a paragraph boundary.
			When used in Visual mode it is made linewise.

a]						*v_a]* *v_a[* *a]* *a[*
a[			"a [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			including the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i]						*v_i]* *v_i[* *i]* *i[*
i[			"inner [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			excluding the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a)							*v_a)* *a)* *a(*
a(							*v_ab* *v_a(* *ab*
ab			"a block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [(" to
			the matching ')', including the '(' and ')' (see
			|[(|).  Does not include white space outside of the
			parenthesis.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i)							*v_i)* *i)* *i(*
i(							*v_ib* *v_i(* *ib*
ib			"inner block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [("
			to the matching ')', excluding the '(' and ')' (see
			|[(|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a>						*v_a>* *v_a<* *a>* *a<*
a<			"a <> block", select [count] <> blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched '<' backwards to the matching
			'>', including the '<' and '>'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i>						*v_i>* *v_i<* *i>* *i<*
i<			"inner <> block", select [count] <> blocks, from
			the [count]'th unmatched '<' backwards to the matching
			'>', excluding the '<' and '>'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

						*v_at* *at*
at			"a tag block", select [count] tag blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched "<aaa>" backwards to the matching
			"</aaa>", including the "<aaa>" and "</aaa>".
			See |tag-blocks| about the details.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

						*v_it* *it*
it			"inner tag block", select [count] tag blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched "<aaa>" backwards to the matching
			"</aaa>", excluding the "<aaa>" and "</aaa>".
			See |tag-blocks| about the details.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a}							*v_a}* *a}* *a{*
a{							*v_aB* *v_a{* *aB*
aB			"a Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{" to
			the matching '}', including the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i}							*v_i}* *i}* *i{*
i{							*v_iB* *v_i{* *iB*
iB			"inner Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{"
			to the matching '}', excluding the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a"							*v_aquote* *aquote*
a'							*v_a'* *a'*
a`							*v_a`* *a`*
			"a quoted string".  Selects the text from the previous
			quote until the next quote.  The 'quoteescape' option
			is used to skip escaped quotes.
			Only works within one line.
			When the cursor starts on a quote, Vim will figure out
			which quote pairs form a string by searching from the
			start of the line.
			Any trailing white space is included, unless there is
			none, then leading white space is included.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.
			Repeating this object in Visual mode another string is
			included.  A count is currently not used.

i"							*v_iquote* *iquote*
i'							*v_i'* *i'*
i`							*v_i`* *i`*
			Like a", a' and a`, but exclude the quotes and
			repeating won't extend the Visual selection.
			Special case: With a count of 2 the quotes are
			included, but no extra white space as with a"/a'/a`.

When used after an operator:
For non-block objects:
	For the "a" commands: The operator applies to the object and the white
	space after the object.  If there is no white space after the object
	or when the cursor was in the white space before the object, the white
	space before the object is included.
	For the "inner" commands: If the cursor was on the object, the
	operator applies to the object.  If the cursor was on white space, the
	operator applies to the white space.
For a block object:
	The operator applies to the block where the cursor is in, or the block
	on which the cursor is on one of the braces.  For the "inner" commands
	the surrounding braces are excluded.  For the "a" commands, the braces
	are included.

When used in Visual mode:
When start and end of the Visual area are the same (just after typing "v"):
	One object is selected, the same as for using an operator.
When start and end of the Visual area are not the same:
	For non-block objects the area is extended by one object or the white
	space up to the next object, or both for the "a" objects.  The
	direction in which this happens depends on which side of the Visual
	area the cursor is.  For the block objects the block is extended one
	level outwards.

For illustration, here is a list of delete commands, grouped from small to big
objects.  Note that for a single character and a whole line the existing vi
movement commands are used.
	"dl"	delete character (alias: "x")		|dl|
	"diw"	delete inner word			*diw*
	"daw"	delete a word				*daw*
	"diW"	delete inner WORD (see |WORD|)		*diW*
	"daW"	delete a WORD (see |WORD|)		*daW*
	"dgn"   delete the next search pattern match    *dgn*
	"dd"	delete one line				|dd|
	"dis"	delete inner sentence			*dis*
	"das"	delete a sentence			*das*
	"dib"	delete inner '(' ')' block		*dib*
	"dab"	delete a '(' ')' block			*dab*
	"dip"	delete inner paragraph			*dip*
	"dap"	delete a paragraph			*dap*
	"diB"	delete inner '{' '}' block		*diB*
	"daB"	delete a '{' '}' block			*daB*

Note the difference between using a movement command and an object.  The
movement command operates from here (cursor position) to where the movement
takes us.  When using an object the whole object is operated upon, no matter
where on the object the cursor is.  For example, compare "dw" and "daw": "dw"
deletes from the cursor position to the start of the next word, "daw" deletes
the word under the cursor and the space after or before it.


Tag blocks						*tag-blocks*

For the "it" and "at" text objects an attempt is done to select blocks between
matching tags for HTML and XML.  But since these are not completely compatible
there are a few restrictions.

The normal method is to select a <tag> until the matching </tag>.  For "at"
the tags are included, for "it" they are excluded.  But when "it" is repeated
the tags will be included (otherwise nothing would change).  Also, "it" used
on a tag block with no contents will select the leading tag.

"<aaa/>" items are skipped.  Case is ignored, also for XML where case does
matter.

In HTML it is possible to have a tag like <br> or <meta ...> without a
matching end tag.  These are ignored.

The text objects are tolerant about mistakes.  Stray end tags are ignored.

==============================================================================
7. Marks					*mark-motions* *E20* *E78*

Jumping to a mark can be done in two ways:
1. With ` (backtick):	  The cursor is positioned at the specified location
			  and the motion is |exclusive|.
2. With ' (single quote): The cursor is positioned on the first non-blank
			  character in the line of the specified location and
			  the motion is linewise.

						*m* *mark* *Mark*
m{a-zA-Z}		Set mark {a-zA-Z} at cursor position (does not move
			the cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m'* *m`*
m'  or  m`		Set the previous context mark.  This can be jumped to
			with the "''" or "``" command (does not move the
			cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m[* *m]*
m[  or  m]		Set the |'[| or |']| mark.  Useful when an operator is
			to be simulated by multiple commands.  (does not move
			the cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m<* *m>*
m<  or  m>		Set the |'<| or |'>| mark.  Useful to change what the
			`gv` command selects.  (does not move the cursor, this
			is not a motion command).
			Note that the Visual mode cannot be set, only the
			start and end position.

						*:ma* *:mark* *E191*
:[range]ma[rk] {a-zA-Z'}
			Set mark {a-zA-Z'} at last line number in [range],
			column 0.  Default is cursor line.

						*:k*
:[range]k{a-zA-Z'}	Same as :mark, but the space before the mark name can
			be omitted.

						*'* *'a* *`* *`a*
'{a-z}  `{a-z}		Jump to the mark {a-z} in the current buffer.

						*'A* *'0* *`A* *`0*
'{A-Z0-9}  `{A-Z0-9}	To the mark {A-Z0-9} in the file where it was set (not
			a motion command when in another file).  {not in Vi}

						*g'* *g'a* *g`* *g`a*
g'{mark}  g`{mark}
			Jump to the {mark}, but don't change the jumplist when
			jumping within the current buffer.  Example: >
				g`"
<			jumps to the last known position in a file.  See
			$VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim.
			Also see |:keepjumps|.
			{not in Vi}

						*:marks*
:marks			List all the current marks (not a motion command).
			The |'(|, |')|, |'{| and |'}| marks are not listed.
			The first column has number zero.
			{not in Vi}
						*E283*
:marks {arg}		List the marks that are mentioned in {arg} (not a
			motion command).  For example: >
				:marks aB
<			to list marks 'a' and 'B'.  {not in Vi}

							*:delm* *:delmarks*
:delm[arks] {marks}	Delete the specified marks.  Marks that can be deleted
			include A-Z and 0-9.  You cannot delete the ' mark.
			They can be specified by giving the list of mark
			names, or with a range, separated with a dash.  Spaces
			are ignored.  Examples: >
			   :delmarks a	      deletes mark a
			   :delmarks a b 1    deletes marks a, b and 1
			   :delmarks Aa       deletes marks A and a
			   :delmarks p-z      deletes marks in the range p to z
			   :delmarks ^.[]     deletes marks ^ . [ ]
			   :delmarks \"	      deletes mark "
<			{not in Vi}

:delm[arks]!		Delete all marks for the current buffer, but not marks
			A-Z or 0-9.
			{not in Vi}

A mark is not visible in any way.  It is just a position in the file that is
remembered.  Do not confuse marks with named registers, they are totally
unrelated.

'a - 'z		lowercase marks, valid within one file
'A - 'Z		uppercase marks, also called file marks, valid between files
'0 - '9		numbered marks, set from .viminfo file

Lowercase marks 'a to 'z are remembered as long as the file remains in the
buffer list.  If you remove the file from the buffer list, all its marks are
lost.  If you delete a line that contains a mark, that mark is erased.

Lowercase marks can be used in combination with operators.  For example: "d't"
deletes the lines from the cursor position to mark 't'.  Hint: Use mark 't' for
Top, 'b' for Bottom, etc..  Lowercase marks are restored when using undo and
redo.

Uppercase marks 'A to 'Z include the file name.  {Vi: no uppercase marks} You
can use them to jump from file to file.  You can only use an uppercase mark
with an operator if the mark is in the current file.  The line number of the
mark remains correct, even if you insert/delete lines or edit another file for
a moment.  When the 'viminfo' option is not empty, uppercase marks are kept in
the .viminfo file.  See |viminfo-file-marks|.

Numbered marks '0 to '9 are quite different.  They can not be set directly.
They are only present when using a viminfo file |viminfo-file|.  Basically '0
is the location of the cursor when you last exited Vim, '1 the last but one
time, etc.  Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify files for which no
Numbered mark should be stored.  See |viminfo-file-marks|.


							*'[* *`[*
'[  `[			To the first character of the previously changed
			or yanked text.  {not in Vi}

							*']* *`]*
']  `]			To the last character of the previously changed or
			yanked text.  {not in Vi}

After executing an operator the Cursor is put at the beginning of the text
that was operated upon.  After a put command ("p" or "P") the cursor is
sometimes placed at the first inserted line and sometimes on the last inserted
character.  The four commands above put the cursor at either end.  Example:
After yanking 10 lines you want to go to the last one of them: "10Y']".  After
inserting several lines with the "p" command you want to jump to the lowest
inserted line: "p']".  This also works for text that has been inserted.

Note: After deleting text, the start and end positions are the same, except
when using blockwise Visual mode.  These commands do not work when no change
was made yet in the current file.

							*'<* *`<*
'<  `<			To the first line or character of the last selected
			Visual area in the current buffer.  For block mode it
			may also be the last character in the first line (to
			be able to define the block).  {not in Vi}.

							*'>* *`>*
'>  `>			To the last line or character of the last selected
			Visual area in the current buffer.  For block mode it
			may also be the first character of the last line (to
			be able to define the block).  Note that 'selection'
			applies, the position may be just after the Visual
			area.  {not in Vi}.

							*''* *``*
''  ``			To the position before the latest jump, or where the
			last "m'" or "m`" command was given.  Not set when the
			|:keepjumps| command modifier was used.
			Also see |restore-position|.

							*'quote* *`quote*
'"  `"			To the cursor position when last exiting the current
			buffer.  Defaults to the first character of the first
			line.  See |last-position-jump| for how to use this
			for each opened file.
			Only one position is remembered per buffer, not one
			for each window.  As long as the buffer is visible in
			a window the position won't be changed.
			{not in Vi}.

							*'^* *`^*
'^  `^			To the position where the cursor was the last time
			when Insert mode was stopped.  This is used by the
			|gi| command.  Not set when the |:keepjumps| command
			modifier was used.  {not in Vi}

							*'.* *`.*
'.  `.			To the position where the last change was made.  The
			position is at or near where the change started.
			Sometimes a command is executed as several changes,
			then the position can be near the end of what the
			command changed.  For example when inserting a word,
			the position will be on the last character.
			{not in Vi}

							*'(* *`(*
'(  `(			To the start of the current sentence, like the |(|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*')* *`)*
')  `)			To the end of the current sentence, like the |)|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*'{* *`{*
'{  `{			To the start of the current paragraph, like the |{|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*'}* *`}*
'}  `}			To the end of the current paragraph, like the |}|
			command.  {not in Vi}

These commands are not marks themselves, but jump to a mark:

							*]'*
]'			[count] times to next line with a lowercase mark below
			the cursor, on the first non-blank character in the
			line. {not in Vi}

							*]`*
]`			[count] times to lowercase mark after the cursor. {not
			in Vi}

							*['*
['			[count] times to previous line with a lowercase mark
			before the cursor, on the first non-blank character in
			the line. {not in Vi}

							*[`*
[`			[count] times to lowercase mark before the cursor.
			{not in Vi}


:loc[kmarks] {command}					*:loc* *:lockmarks*
			Execute {command} without adjusting marks.  This is
			useful when changing text in a way that the line count
			will be the same when the change has completed.
			WARNING: When the line count does change, marks below
			the change will keep their line number, thus move to
			another text line.
			These items will not be adjusted for deleted/inserted
			lines:
			- lower case letter marks 'a - 'z
			- upper case letter marks 'A - 'Z
			- numbered marks '0 - '9
			- last insert position '^
			- last change position '.
			- the Visual area '< and '>
			- line numbers in placed signs
			- line numbers in quickfix positions
			- positions in the |jumplist|
			- positions in the |tagstack|
			These items will still be adjusted:
			- previous context mark ''
			- the cursor position
			- the view of a window on a buffer
			- folds
			- diffs

:kee[pmarks] {command}					*:kee* *:keepmarks*
			Currently only has effect for the filter command
			|:range!|:
			- When the number of lines after filtering is equal to
			  or larger than before, all marks are kept at the
			  same line number.
			- When the number of lines decreases, the marks in the
			  lines that disappeared are deleted.
			In any case the marks below the filtered text have
			their line numbers adjusted, thus stick to the text,
			as usual.
			When the 'R' flag is missing from 'cpoptions' this has
			the same effect as using ":keepmarks".

							*:keepj* *:keepjumps*
:keepj[umps] {command}
			Moving around in {command} does not change the |''|,
			|'.| and |'^| marks, the |jumplist| or the
			|changelist|.
			Useful when making a change or inserting text
			automatically and the user doesn't want to go to this
			position.  E.g., when updating a "Last change"
			timestamp in the first line: >

				:let lnum = line(".")
				:keepjumps normal gg
				:call SetLastChange()
				:keepjumps exe "normal " . lnum . "G"
<
			Note that ":keepjumps" must be used for every command.
			When invoking a function the commands in that function
			can still change the jumplist.  Also, for
			":keepjumps exe 'command '" the "command" won't keep
			jumps.  Instead use: ":exe 'keepjumps command'"

==============================================================================
8. Jumps					*jump-motions*

A "jump" is one of the following commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n",
"N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and
the commands that start editing a new file.  If you make the cursor "jump"
with one of these commands, the position of the cursor before the jump is
remembered.  You can return to that position with the "''" and "``" command,
unless the line containing that position was changed or deleted.

							*CTRL-O*
CTRL-O			Go to [count] Older cursor position in jump list
			(not a motion command).  {not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

<Tab>		or					*CTRL-I* *<Tab>*
CTRL-I			Go to [count] newer cursor position in jump list
			(not a motion command).
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*:ju* *:jumps*
:ju[mps]		Print the jump list (not a motion command).  {not in
			Vi} {not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*jumplist*
Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you
can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can
move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window.
The maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.
{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

For example, after three jump commands you have this jump list:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    3	  1    0 some text ~
    2	 70    0 another line ~
    1  1154   23 end. ~
 > ~

The "file/text" column shows the file name, or the text at the jump if it is
in the current file (an indent is removed and a long line is truncated to fit
in the window).

You are currently in line 1167.  If you then use the CTRL-O command, the
cursor is put in line 1154.  This results in:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    2	  1    0 some text ~
    1	 70    0 another line ~
 >  0  1154   23 end. ~
    1  1167    0 foo bar ~

The pointer will be set at the last used jump position.  The next CTRL-O
command will use the entry above it, the next CTRL-I command will use the
entry below it.  If the pointer is below the last entry, this indicates that
you did not use a CTRL-I or CTRL-O before.  In this case the CTRL-O command
will cause the cursor position to be added to the jump list, so you can get
back to the position before the CTRL-O.  In this case this is line 1167.

With more CTRL-O commands you will go to lines 70 and 1.  If you use CTRL-I
you can go back to 1154 and 1167 again.  Note that the number in the "jump"
column indicates the count for the CTRL-O or CTRL-I command that takes you to
this position.

If you use a jump command, the current line number is inserted at the end of
the jump list.  If the same line was already in the jump list, it is removed.
The result is that when repeating CTRL-O you will get back to old positions
only once.

When the |:keepjumps| command modifier is used, jumps are not stored in the
jumplist.  Jumps are also not stored in other cases, e.g., in a |:global|
command.  You can explicitly add a jump by setting the ' mark with "m'".  Note
that calling setpos() does not do this.

After the CTRL-O command that got you into line 1154 you could give another
jump command (e.g., "G").  The jump list would then become:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    4	  1    0 some text ~
    3	 70    0 another line ~
    2  1167    0 foo bar ~
    1  1154   23 end. ~
 > ~

The line numbers will be adjusted for deleted and inserted lines.  This fails
if you stop editing a file without writing, like with ":n!".

When you split a window, the jumplist will be copied to the new window.

If you have included the ' item in the 'viminfo' option the jumplist will be
stored in the viminfo file and restored when starting Vim.


CHANGE LIST JUMPS			*changelist* *change-list-jumps* *E664*

When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is
remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a
previous change.  Two commands can be used to jump to positions of changes,
also those that have been undone:

							*g;* *E662*
g;			Go to [count] older position in change list.
			If [count] is larger than the number of older change
			positions go to the oldest change.
			If there is no older change an error message is given.
			(not a motion command)
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*g,* *E663*
g,			Go to [count] newer cursor position in change list.
			Just like |g;| but in the opposite direction.
			(not a motion command)
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

When using a count you jump as far back or forward as possible.  Thus you can
use "999g;" to go to the first change for which the position is still
remembered.  The number of entries in the change list is fixed and is the same
as for the |jumplist|.

When two undo-able changes are in the same line and at a column position less
than 'textwidth' apart only the last one is remembered.  This avoids that a
sequence of small changes in a line, for example "xxxxx", adds many positions
to the change list.  When 'textwidth' is zero 'wrapmargin' is used.  When that
also isn't set a fixed number of 79 is used.  Detail: For the computations
bytes are used, not characters, to avoid a speed penalty (this only matters
for multi-byte encodings).

Note that when text has been inserted or deleted the cursor position might be
a bit different from the position of the change.  Especially when lines have
been deleted.

When the |:keepjumps| command modifier is used the position of a change is not
remembered.

							*:changes*
:changes		Print the change list.  A ">" character indicates the
			current position.  Just after a change it is below the
			newest entry, indicating that "g;" takes you to the
			newest entry position.  The first column indicates the
			count needed to take you to this position.  Example:

				change line  col text ~
				    3     9    8 bla bla bla
				    2    11   57 foo is a bar
				    1    14   54 the latest changed line
				>

			The "3g;" command takes you to line 9.  Then the
			output of ":changes is:

				change line  col text ~
				>   0     9    8 bla bla bla
				    1    11   57 foo is a bar
				    2    14   54 the latest changed line

			Now you can use "g," to go to line 11 and "2g," to go
			to line 14.

==============================================================================
9. Various motions				*various-motions*

							*%*
%			Find the next item in this line after or under the
			cursor and jump to its match. |inclusive| motion.
			Items can be:
			([{}])		parenthesis or (curly/square) brackets
					(this can be changed with the
					'matchpairs' option)
			/* */		start or end of C-style comment
			#if, #ifdef, #else, #elif, #endif
					C preprocessor conditionals (when the
					cursor is on the # or no ([{
					following)
			For other items the matchit plugin can be used, see
			|matchit-install|.  This plugin also helps to skip
			matches in comments.

			When 'cpoptions' contains "M" |cpo-M| backslashes
			before parens and braces are ignored.  Without "M" the
			number of backslashes matters: an even number doesn't
			match with an odd number.  Thus in "( \) )" and "\( (
			\)" the first and last parenthesis match.

			When the '%' character is not present in 'cpoptions'
			|cpo-%|, parens and braces inside double quotes are
			ignored, unless the number of parens/braces in a line
			is uneven and this line and the previous one does not
			end in a backslash.  '(', '{', '[', ']', '}' and ')'
			are also ignored (parens and braces inside single
			quotes).  Note that this works fine for C, but not for
			Perl, where single quotes are used for strings.

			Nothing special is done for matches in comments.  You
			can either use the matchit plugin |matchit-install| or
			put quotes around matches.

			No count is allowed, {count}% jumps to a line {count}
			percentage down the file |N%|.  Using '%' on
			#if/#else/#endif makes the movement linewise.

						*[(*
[(			go to [count] previous unmatched '('.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*[{*
[{			go to [count] previous unmatched '{'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*])*
])			go to [count] next unmatched ')'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]}*
]}			go to [count] next unmatched '}'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

The above four commands can be used to go to the start or end of the current
code block.  It is like doing "%" on the '(', ')', '{' or '}' at the other
end of the code block, but you can do this from anywhere in the code block.
Very useful for C programs.  Example: When standing on "case x:", "[{" will
bring you back to the switch statement.

						*]m*
]m			Go to [count] next start of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not before the
			start of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '{' is found after the cursor, this is
			an error.  |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*]M*
]M			Go to [count] next end of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not before the end
			of a method, jump to the start or end of the class.
			When no '}' is found after the cursor, this is an
			error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*[m*
[m			Go to [count] previous start of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not after the
			start of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '{' is found before the cursor this is
			an error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*[M*
[M			Go to [count] previous end of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not after the
			end of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '}' is found before the cursor this is
			an error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

The above two commands assume that the file contains a class with methods.
The class definition is surrounded in '{' and '}'.  Each method in the class
is also surrounded with '{' and '}'.  This applies to the Java language.  The
file looks like this: >

	// comment
	class foo {
		int method_one() {
			body_one();
		}
		int method_two() {
			body_two();
		}
	}
Starting with the cursor on "body_two()", using "[m" will jump to the '{' at
the start of "method_two()" (obviously this is much more useful when the
method is long!).  Using "2[m" will jump to the start of "method_one()".
Using "3[m" will jump to the start of the class.

						*[#*
[#			go to [count] previous unmatched "#if" or "#else".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]#*
]#			go to [count] next unmatched "#else" or "#endif".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

These two commands work in C programs that contain #if/#else/#endif
constructs.  It brings you to the start or end of the #if/#else/#endif where
the current line is included.  You can then use "%" to go to the matching line.

						*[star* *[/*
[*  or  [/		go to [count] previous start of a C comment "/*".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]star* *]/*
]*  or  ]/		go to [count] next end of a C comment "*/".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}


						*H*
H			To line [count] from top (Home) of window (default:
			first line on the window) on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.
			Cursor is adjusted for 'scrolloff' option.

						*M*
M			To Middle line of window, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.

						*L*
L			To line [count] from bottom of window (default: Last
			line on the window) on the first non-blank character
			|linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.
			Cursor is adjusted for 'scrolloff' option.

<LeftMouse>		Moves to the position on the screen where the mouse
			click is |exclusive|.  See also |<LeftMouse>|.  If the
			position is in a status line, that window is made the
			active window and the cursor is not moved.  {not in Vi}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*netbeans-intro*

The NetBeans interface was initially developed to integrate Vim into the
NetBeans Java IDE, using the external editor plugin.  This NetBeans plugin no
longer exists for recent versions of NetBeans but the protocol was developed
in such a way that any IDE can use it to integrate Vim.

The NetBeans protocol of Vim is a text based communication protocol, over a
classical TCP socket. There is no dependency on Java or NetBeans. Any language
or environment providing a socket interface can control Vim using this
protocol. There are existing implementations in C, C++, Python and Java. The
name NetBeans is kept today for historical reasons.

Current projects using the NetBeans protocol of Vim are:
- VimIntegration, description of various projects doing Vim Integration:
	http://www.freehackers.org/VimIntegration
- Agide, an IDE for the AAP project, written in Python:
	http://www.a-a-p.org
- Clewn, a gdb integration into Vim, written in C:
	http://clewn.sourceforge.net/
- Pyclewn, a gdb integration into Vim, written in Python:
	http://pyclewn.sourceforge.net/
- VimPlugin, integration of Vim inside Eclipse:
	http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/wiki/pmwiki.php
- PIDA, IDE written in Python integrating Vim:
	http://pida.co.uk/
- VimWrapper, library to easy Vim integration into IDE:
	http://www.freehackers.org/VimWrapper

Check the specific project pages to see how to use Vim with these projects.

In the rest of this help page, we will use the term "Vim Controller" to
describe the program controlling Vim through the NetBeans socket interface.


About the NetBeans IDE ~

NetBeans is an open source Integrated Development Environment developed
jointly by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and the netbeans.org developer community.
Initially just a Java IDE, NetBeans has had C, C++, and Fortran support added
in recent releases.

For more information visit the main NetBeans web site http://www.netbeans.org.
The External Editor is now, unfortunately, declared obsolete.  See

2. Integration features					*netbeans-integration*

The NetBeans socket interface of Vim allows to get information from Vim or to
ask Vim to perform specific actions:
- get information about buffer: buffer name, cursor position, buffer content,
  etc.
- be notified when buffers are open or closed
- be notified of how the buffer content is modified
- load and save files
- modify the buffer content
- installing special key bindings
- raise the window, control the window geometry

For sending key strokes to Vim or for evaluating functions in Vim, you must
use the |clientserver| interface.


==============================================================================
3. Configuring Vim for NetBeans			*netbeans-configure*

For more help about installing Vim, please read |usr_90.txt| in the Vim User
Manual.


On Unix:
--------

When running configure without arguments the NetBeans interface should be
included.  That is, if the configure check to find out if your system supports
the required features succeeds.

In case you do not want the NetBeans interface you can disable it by
uncommenting a line with "--disable-netbeans" in the Makefile.

Currently the NetBeans interface is supported by Vim running in a terminal and
by GVim when it is run with one of the following GUIs: GTK, GNOME, Windows,
Athena and Motif.

If Motif support is required the user must supply XPM libraries.  See
|workshop-xpm| for details on obtaining the latest version of XPM.


On MS-Windows:
--------------

The Win32 support is now in beta stage.

To use XPM signs on Win32 (e.g. when using with NetBeans) you can compile
XPM by yourself or use precompiled libraries from http://iamphet.nm.ru/misc/
(for MS Visual C++) or http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net (for MinGW).

Enable debugging:
-----------------

To enable debugging of Vim and of the NetBeans protocol, the "NBDEBUG" macro
needs to be defined.  Search in the Makefile of the platform you are using for
"NBDEBUG" to see what line needs to be uncommented.  This effectively adds
"-DNBDEBUG" to the compile command.  Also see |netbeans-debugging|

==============================================================================
4. Error Messages					*netbeans-messages*

These error messages are specific to NetBeans socket protocol:

							*E463*
Region is guarded, cannot modify
		The Vim Controller has defined guarded areas in the text,
		which you cannot change.  Also sets the current buffer, if
		necessary.

							*E532*
The defineAnnoType highlighting color name is too long
		The maximum length of the "fg" or "bg" color argument in the
		defineAnnoType command is 32 characters.
		New in version 2.5.

							*E656*
Writes of unmodified buffers forbidden
		Writes of unmodified buffers that were opened from the
		Vim Controller are not possible.

							*E657*
Partial writes disallowed
		Partial writes for buffers that were opened from the
		Vim Controller are not allowed.

							*E658*
Connection lost for this buffer
		The Vim Controller has become confused about the state of
		this file.  Rather than risk data corruption, it has severed
		the connection for this file.  Vim will take over
		responsibility for saving changes to this file and the
		Vim Controller will no longer know of these changes.

							*E744*
Read-only file
		Vim normally allows changes to a read-only file and only
		enforces the read-only rule if you try to write the file.
		However, NetBeans does not let you make changes to a file
		which is read-only and becomes confused if Vim does this.
		So Vim does not allow modifications to files when run
		in NetBeans mode.

==============================================================================
5. Running Vim in NetBeans mode				*netbeans-run*

There are two different ways to run Vim in NetBeans mode:

	+ an IDE may start Vim with the |-nb| command line argument
	+ NetBeans can be started from within Vim with the |:nbstart| command

							*netbeans-parameters*
Three forms can be used to setup the NetBeans connection parameters.
When started from the command line, the |-nb| command line argument may be:

	-nb={fname}				from a file
	-nb:{hostname}:{addr}:{password}	directly
	-nb					from a file or environment

When started from within Vim, the |:nbstart| optional argument may be:

	={fname}				from a file
	:{hostname}:{addr}:{password}	        directly
	<MISSING ARGUMENT>			from a file or environment

							*E660* *E668*
When NetBeans is started from the command line, for security reasons, the best
method is to write the information in a file readable only by the user.  The
name of the file can be passed with the "-nb={fname}" argument or, when "-nb"
is used without a parameter, the environment variable "__NETBEANS_CONINFO".
The file must contain these three lines, in any order:

	host={hostname}
	port={addr}
	auth={password}

Other lines are ignored.  The Vim Controller is responsible for deleting the
file afterwards.

{hostname} is the name of the machine where Vim Controller is running.  When
omitted the environment variable "__NETBEANS_HOST" is used or the default
"localhost".

{addr} is the port number for the NetBeans interface.  When omitted the
environment variable "__NETBEANS_SOCKET" is used or the default 3219.

{password} is the password for connecting to NetBeans.  When omitted the
environment variable "__NETBEANS_VIM_PASSWORD" is used or "changeme".

Vim will initiate a socket connection (client side) to the specified host and
port upon startup. The password will be sent with the AUTH event when the
connection has been established.


==============================================================================
6. NetBeans protocol					*netbeans-protocol*

The communication between the Vim Controller and Vim uses plain text
messages.  This protocol was first designed to work with the external editor
module of NetBeans.  Later it was extended to work with Agide (A-A-P GUI IDE,
see http://www.a-a-p.org) and then with other IDE. The extensions are marked
with "version 2.1".

Version 2.2 of the protocol has several minor changes which should only affect
NetBeans users (ie, not Agide users).  However, a bug was fixed which could
cause confusion.  The netbeans_saved() function sent a "save" protocol
command.  In protocol version 2.1 and earlier this was incorrectly interpreted
as a notification that a write had taken place.  In reality, it told NetBeans
to save the file so multiple writes were being done.  This caused various
problems and has been fixed in 2.2.  To decrease the likelihood of this
confusion happening again, netbeans_saved() has been renamed to
netbeans_save_buffer().

We are now at version 2.5.  For the differences between 2.4 and 2.5 search for
"2.5" below.

The messages are currently sent over a socket.  Since the messages are in
plain UTF-8 text this protocol could also be used with any other communication
mechanism.

Netbeans messages are processed when Vim is idle, waiting for user input.
When Vim is run in non-interactive mode, for example when running an automated
test case that sources a Vim script, the idle loop may not be called often
enough. In that case, insert |:sleep| commands in the Vim script. The |:sleep|
command does invoke Netbeans messages processing.

6.1 Kinds of messages		|nb-messages|
6.2 Terms			|nb-terms|
6.3 Commands			|nb-commands|
6.4 Functions and Replies	|nb-functions|
6.5 Events			|nb-events|
6.6 Special messages		|nb-special|
6.7 Protocol errors		|nb-protocol_errors|


6.1 Kinds of messages					*nb-messages*

There are four kinds of messages:

kind		direction	comment ~
Command		IDE -> editor	no reply necessary
Function	IDE -> editor	editor must send back a reply
Reply		editor -> IDE	only in response to a Function
Event		editor -> IDE	no reply necessary

The messages are sent as a single line with a terminating newline character.
Arguments are separated by a single space.  The first item of the message
depends on the kind of message:

kind		first item		example ~
Command		bufID:name!seqno	11:showBalloon!123 "text"
Function	bufID:name/seqno	11:getLength/123
Reply		seqno			123 5000
Event		bufID:name=seqno	11:keyCommand=123 "S-F2"



6.2 Terms						*nb-terms*

bufID		Buffer number.  A message may be either for a specific buffer
		or generic.  Generic messages use a bufID of zero.  NOTE: this
		buffer ID is assigned by the IDE, it is not Vim's buffer
		number.  The bufID must be a sequentially rising number,
		starting at one.

seqno		The IDE uses a sequence number for Commands and Functions.  A
		Reply must use the sequence number of the Function that it is
		associated with.  A zero sequence number can be used for
		Events (the seqno of the last received Command or Function can
		also be used).

string		Argument in double quotes.  Text is in UTF-8 encoding.  This
		means ASCII is passed as-is.  Special characters are
		represented with a backslash:
			\"	double quote
			\n	newline
			\r	carriage-return
			\t	tab (optional, also works literally)
			\\	backslash
		NUL bytes are not allowed!

boolean		Argument with two possible values:
			T	true
			F	false

number		Argument with a decimal number.

color		Argument with either a decimal number, "none" (without the
		quotes) or the name of a color (without the quotes) defined
		both in the color list in |highlight-ctermfg| and in the color
		list in |gui-colors|.
		New in version 2.5.

offset		A number argument that indicates a byte position in a buffer.
		The first byte has offset zero.  Line breaks are counted for
		how they appear in the file (CR/LF counts for two bytes).
		Note that a multi-byte character is counted for the number of
		bytes it takes.

lnum/col	Argument with a line number and column number position.  The
		line number starts with one, the column is the byte position,
		starting with zero.  Note that a multi-byte character counts
		for several columns.

pathname	String argument: file name with full path.


6.3 Commands						*nb-commands*

actionMenuItem	Not implemented.

actionSensitivity
		Not implemented.

addAnno serNum typeNum off len
		Place an annotation in this buffer.
		Arguments:
		   serNum	number	serial number of this placed
					annotation, used to be able to remove
					it
		   typeNum	number	sequence number of the annotation
					defined with defineAnnoType for this
					buffer
		   off		number	offset where annotation is to be placed
		   len		number	not used
		In version 2.1 "lnum/col" can be used instead of "off".

balloonResult text
		Not implemented.

close		Close the buffer.  This leaves us without current buffer, very
		dangerous to use!

create		Creates a buffer without a name.  Replaces the current buffer
		(it's hidden when it was changed).
		The Vim Controller should use this as the first command for a
		file that is being opened.  The sequence of commands could be:
			create
			setCaretListener	(ignored)
			setModified		(no effect)
			setContentType		(ignored)
			startDocumentListen
			setTitle
			setFullName

defineAnnoType typeNum typeName tooltip glyphFile fg bg
		Define a type of annotation for this buffer.
		Arguments:
		   typeNum	number	sequence number (not really used)
		   typeName	string	name that identifies this annotation
		   tooltip	string	not used
		   glyphFile	string	name of icon file
		   fg		color	foreground color for line highlighting
		   bg		color	background color for line highlighting
		Vim will define a sign for the annotation.
		When color is a number, this is the "#rrggbb" Red, Green and
		Blue values of the color (see |gui-colors|) and the
		highlighting is only defined for GVim.
		When color is a name, this color is defined both for Vim
		running in a color terminal and for GVim.
		When both "fg" and "bg" are "none" no line highlighting is
		used (new in version 2.1).
		When "glyphFile" is empty, no text sign is used (new in
		version 2.1).
		When "glyphFile" is one or two characters long, a text sign is
		defined (new in version 2.1).
		Note: the annotations will be defined in sequence, and the
		sequence number is later used with addAnno.

editFile pathname
		Set the name for the buffer and edit the file "pathname", a
		string argument.
		Normal way for the IDE to tell the editor to edit a file.

		You must set a bufId different of 0 with this command to
		assign a bufId to the buffer. It will trigger an event
		fileOpened with a bufId of 0 but the buffer has been assigned.

		If the IDE is going to pass the file text to the editor use
		these commands instead:
			setFullName
			insert
			initDone
		New in version 2.1.

enableBalloonEval
		Not implemented.

endAtomic	End an atomic operation.  The changes between "startAtomic"
		and "endAtomic" can be undone as one operation.  But it's not
		implemented yet.  Redraw when necessary.

guard off len
		Mark an area in the buffer as guarded.  This means it cannot
		be edited.  "off" and "len" are numbers and specify the text
		to be guarded.

initDone	Mark the buffer as ready for use.  Implicitly makes the buffer
		the current buffer.  Fires the BufReadPost autocommand event.

insertDone
		Sent by Vim Controller to tell Vim an initial file insert is
		done.  This triggers a read message being printed.  Prior to
		version 2.3, no read messages were displayed after opening a
		file.  New in version 2.3.

moveAnnoToFront serNum
		Not implemented.

netbeansBuffer isNetbeansBuffer
		If "isNetbeansBuffer" is "T" then this buffer is "owned" by
		NetBeans.
		New in version 2.2.

putBufferNumber pathname
		Associate a buffer number with the Vim buffer by the name
		"pathname", a string argument.  To be used when the editor
		reported editing another file to the IDE and the IDE needs to
		tell the editor what buffer number it will use for this file.
		Also marks the buffer as initialized.
		New in version 2.1.

raise		Bring the editor to the foreground.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

removeAnno serNum
		Remove a previously placed annotation for this buffer.
		"serNum" is the same number used in addAnno.

save		Save the buffer when it was modified.  The other side of the
		interface is expected to write the buffer and invoke
		"setModified" to reset the "changed" flag of the buffer.
		The writing is skipped when one of these conditions is true:
		- 'write' is not set
		- the buffer is read-only
		- the buffer does not have a file name
		- 'buftype' disallows writing
		New in version 2.2.

saveDone
		Sent by Vim Controller to tell Vim a save is done.  This
		triggers a save message being printed.  Prior to version 2.3,
		no save messages were displayed after a save.
		New in version 2.3.

setAsUser	Not implemented.

setBufferNumber pathname
		Associate a buffer number with Vim buffer by the name
		"pathname".  To be used when the editor reported editing
		another file to the IDE and the IDE needs to tell the editor
		what buffer number it will use for this file.
		Has the side effect of making the buffer the current buffer.
		See "putBufferNumber" for a more useful command.

setContentType
		Not implemented.

setDot off	Make the buffer the current buffer and set the cursor at the
		specified position.  If the buffer is open in another window
		than make that window the current window.
		If there are folds they are opened to make the cursor line
		visible.
		In version 2.1 "lnum/col" can be used instead of "off".

setExitDelay seconds
		Set the delay for exiting to "seconds", a number.
		This delay is used to give the IDE a chance to handle things
		before really exiting.  The default delay is two seconds.
		New in version 2.1.
		Obsolete in version 2.3.

setFullName pathname
		Set the file name to be used for a buffer to "pathname", a
		string argument.
		Used when the IDE wants to edit a file under control of the
		IDE.  This makes the buffer the current buffer, but does not
		read the file.  "insert" commands will be used next to set the
		contents.

setLocAndSize	Not implemented.

setMark		Not implemented.

setModified modified
		When the boolean argument "modified" is "T" mark the buffer as
		modified, when it is "F" mark it as unmodified.

setModtime time
		Update a buffers modification time after the file has been
		saved directly by the Vim Controller.
		New in version 2.3.

setReadOnly
		Set a file as readonly
		Implemented in version 2.3.

setStyle	Not implemented.

setTitle name
		Set the title for the buffer to "name", a string argument.
		The title is only used for the Vim Controller functions, not
		by Vim.

setVisible visible
		When the boolean argument "visible" is "T", goto the buffer.
		The "F" argument does nothing.

showBalloon text
		Show a balloon (popup window) at the mouse pointer position,
		containing "text", a string argument.  The balloon should
		disappear when the mouse is moved more than a few pixels.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

specialKeys
		Map a set of keys (mostly function keys) to be passed back
		to the Vim Controller for processing.  This lets regular IDE
		hotkeys be used from Vim.
		Implemented in version 2.3.

startAtomic	Begin an atomic operation.  The screen will not be updated
		until "endAtomic" is given.

startCaretListen
		Not implemented.

startDocumentListen
		Mark the buffer to report changes to the IDE with the
		"insert" and "remove" events.  The default is to report
		changes.

stopCaretListen
		Not implemented.

stopDocumentListen
		Mark the buffer to stop reporting changes to the IDE.
		Opposite of startDocumentListen.
		NOTE: if "netbeansBuffer" was used to mark this buffer as a
		NetBeans buffer, then the buffer is deleted in Vim.  This is
		for compatibility with Sun Studio 10.

unguard off len
		Opposite of "guard", remove guarding for a text area.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.

version		Not implemented.


6.4 Functions and Replies				*nb-functions*

getDot		Not implemented.

getCursor	Return the current buffer and cursor position.
		The reply is:
			seqno bufID lnum col off
		seqno = sequence number of the function
		bufID = buffer ID of the current buffer (if this is unknown -1
			is used)
		lnum  = line number of the cursor (first line is one)
		col   = column number of the cursor (in bytes, zero based)
		off   = offset of the cursor in the buffer (in bytes)
		New in version 2.1.

getLength	Return the length of the buffer in bytes.
		Reply example for a buffer with 5000 bytes:
			123 5000
		TODO: explain use of partial line.

getMark		Not implemented.

getAnno serNum
		Return the line number of the annotation in the buffer.
		Argument:
			serNum		serial number of this placed annotation
		The reply is:
			123 lnum	line number of the annotation
			123 0		invalid annotation serial number
		New in version 2.4.

getModified	When a buffer is specified: Return zero if the buffer does not
		have changes, one if it does have changes.
		When no buffer is specified (buffer number zero): Return the
		number of buffers with changes.  When the result is zero it's
		safe to tell Vim to exit.
		New in version 2.1.

getText		Return the contents of the buffer as a string.
		Reply example for a buffer with two lines
			123 "first line\nsecond line\n"
		NOTE: docs indicate an offset and length argument, but this is
		not implemented.

insert off text
		Insert "text" before position "off".  "text" is a string
		argument, "off" a number.
		"text" should have a "\n" (newline) at the end of each line.
		Or "\r\n" when 'fileformat' is "dos".  When using "insert" in
		an empty buffer Vim will set 'fileformat' accordingly.
		When "off" points to the start of a line the text is inserted
		above this line.  Thus when "off" is zero lines are inserted
		before the first line.
		When "off" points after the start of a line, possibly on the
		NUL at the end of a line, the first line of text is appended
		to this line.  Further lines come below it.
		Possible replies:
			123		no problem
			123 !message	failed
		Note that the message in the reply is not quoted.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.
		Does not move the cursor to the changed text.
		Resets undo information.

remove off length
		Delete "length" bytes of text at position "off".  Both
		arguments are numbers.
		Possible replies:
			123		no problem
			123 !message	failed
		Note that the message in the reply is not quoted.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.

saveAndExit	Perform the equivalent of closing Vim: ":confirm qall".
		If there are no changed files or the user does not cancel the
		operation Vim exits and no result is sent back.  The IDE can
		consider closing the connection as a successful result.
		If the user cancels the operation the number of modified
		buffers that remains is returned and Vim does not exit.
		New in version 2.1.


6.5 Events						*nb-events*

balloonEval off len type
		The mouse pointer rests on text for a short while.  When "len"
		is zero, there is no selection and the pointer is at position
		"off".  When "len" is non-zero the text from position "off" to
		"off" + "len" is selected.
		Only sent after "enableBalloonEval" was used for this buffer.
		"type" is not yet defined.
		Not implemented yet.

balloonText text
		Used when 'ballooneval' is set and the mouse pointer rests on
		some text for a moment.  "text" is a string, the text under
		the mouse pointer.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

buttonRelease button lnum col
		Report which button was pressed and the location of the cursor
		at the time of the release.  Only for buffers that are owned
		by the Vim Controller.  This event is not sent if the button
		was released while the mouse was in the status line or in a
		separator line.  If col is less than 1 the button release was
		in the sign area.
		New in version 2.2.

disconnect
		Tell the Vim Controller that Vim is exiting and not to try and
		read or write more commands.
		New in version 2.3.

fileClosed	Not implemented.

fileModified	Not implemented.

fileOpened pathname open modified
		A file was opened by the user.

geometry cols rows x y
		Report the size and position of the editor window.
		Arguments:
		   cols		number	  number of text columns
		   rows		number	  number of text rows
		   x		number	  pixel position on screen
		   y		number	  pixel position on screen
		Only works for Motif.

insert off text
		Text "text" has been inserted in Vim at position "off".
		Only fired when enabled, see "startDocumentListen".

invokeAction	Not implemented.

keyCommand keyName
		Reports a special key being pressed with name "keyName", which
		is a string.
		Supported key names:
			F1		function key 1
			F2		function key 2
			...
			F12		function key 12

			' '		space (without the quotes)
			!		exclamation mark
			...		any other ASCII printable character
			~		tilde

			X		any unrecognized key

		The key may be prepended by "C", "S" and/or "M" for Control,
		Shift and Meta (Alt) modifiers.  If there is a modifier a dash
		is used to separate it from the key name.  For example:
		"C-F2".
		ASCII characters are new in version 2.1.

keyAtPos keyName lnum/col
		Like "keyCommand" and also report the line number and column
		of the cursor.
		New in version 2.1.

killed		A file was deleted or wiped out by the user and the buffer
		annotations have been removed.  The bufID number for this
		buffer has become invalid.  Only for files that have been
		assigned a bufID number by the IDE.

newDotAndMark off off
		Reports the position of the cursor being at "off" bytes into
		the buffer.  Only sent just before a "keyCommand" event.

quit		Not implemented.

		editing files.
		New in version 2.1.

unmodified	The buffer is now unmodified.
		Only fired when enabled, see "startDocumentListen".

version vers	Report the version of the interface implementation.  Vim
		reports "2.4" (including the quotes).


6.6 Special messages					*nb-special*

These messages do not follow the style of the messages above.  They are
terminated by a newline character.

ACCEPT		Not used.

AUTH password	editor -> IDE: First message that the editor sends to the IDE.
		Must contain the password for the socket server, as specified
		with the |-nb| argument.  No quotes are used!

DISCONNECT	IDE -> editor: break the connection.  The editor will exit.
		The IDE must only send this message when there are no unsaved
		changes!

DETACH		IDE -> editor: break the connection without exiting the
		editor.  Used when the IDE exits without bringing down the
		editor as well.
		New in version 2.1.

REJECT		Not used.


6.7 Protocol errors					*nb-protocol_errors*

These errors occur when a message violates the protocol:
*E627* *E628* *E629* *E630* *E631* *E632* *E633* *E634* *E635* *E636*
*E637* *E638* *E639* *E640* *E641* *E642* *E643* *E644* *E645* *E646*
*E647* *E648* *E649* *E650* *E651* *E652* *E653* *E654*


==============================================================================
7. NetBeans commands					*netbeans-commands*

							*:nbstart* *E511* *E838*
:nbs[tart] {connection}	Start a new Netbeans session with {connection} as the
			socket connection parameters.  The format of
			{connection} is described in |netbeans-parameters|.
			At any time, one may check if the netbeans socket is
			connected by running the command:
			':echo has("netbeans_enabled")'

							*:nbclose*
:nbc[lose]		Close the current NetBeans session. Remove all placed
			signs.

							*:nbkey*
:nb[key] {key}		Pass the {key} to the Vim Controller for processing.
			When a hot-key has been installed with the specialKeys
			command, this command can be used to generate a hotkey
			message to the Vim Controller.
			This command can also be used to pass any text to the
			Vim  Controller. It is used by Pyclewn, for example,
			to build the complete set of gdb commands as Vim user
			commands.
			The events newDotAndMark, keyCommand and keyAtPos are
			generated (in this order).


==============================================================================
8. Known problems					*netbeans-problems*

NUL bytes are not possible.  For editor -> IDE they will appear as NL
characters.  For IDE -> editor they cannot be inserted.

A NetBeans session may be initiated with Vim running in a terminal, and
continued later in a GUI environment after running the |:gui| command. In this
case, the highlighting defined for the NetBeans annotations may be cleared
when the ":gui" command sources .gvimrc and this file loads a colorscheme
that runs the command ":highlight clear".
New in version 2.5.


==============================================================================
9. Debugging NetBeans protocol				*netbeans-debugging*

To debug the Vim protocol, you must first compile Vim with debugging support
and NetBeans debugging support.  See |netbeans-configure| for instructions
about Vim compiling and how to enable debug support.

When running Vim, set the following environment variables:

    export SPRO_GVIM_DEBUG=netbeans.log
    export SPRO_GVIM_DLEVEL=0xffffffff

Vim will then log all the incoming and outgoing messages of the NetBeans
protocol to the file netbeans.log .

The content of netbeans.log after a session looks like this:
Tue May 20 17:19:27 2008
EVT: 0:startupDone=0

10. NetBeans External Editor

NOTE: This information is obsolete!  Only relevant if you are using an old
version of NetBeans.


10.1. Downloading NetBeans			*netbeans-download*

The NetBeans IDE is available for download from netbeans.org.  You can download
a released version, download sources, or use CVS to download the current
source tree.  If you choose to download sources, follow directions from
netbeans.org on building NetBeans.

Depending on the version of NetBeans you download, you may need to do further
work to get the required External Editor module.  This is the module which lets
NetBeans work with gvim (or xemacs :-).  See http://externaleditor.netbeans.org
for details on downloading this module if your NetBeans release does not have
it.

For C, C++, and Fortran support you will also need the cpp module.  See
http://cpp.netbeans.org for information regarding this module.

You can also download Sun ONE Studio from Sun Microsystems, Inc for a 30 day
free trial.  See http://www.sun.com for further details.


10.2. NetBeans Key Bindings			*netbeans-keybindings*

Vim understands a number of key bindings that execute NetBeans commands.
These are typically all the Function key combinations.  To execute a NetBeans
command, the user must press the Pause key followed by a NetBeans key binding.
For example, in order to compile a Java file, the NetBeans key binding is
"F9".  So, while in vim, press "Pause F9" to compile a java file.  To toggle a
breakpoint at the current line, press "Pause Shift F8".

The Pause key is Function key 21.  If you don't have a working Pause key and
want to use F8 instead, use: >

	:map <F8> <F21>

The External Editor module dynamically reads the NetBeans key bindings so vim
should always have the latest key bindings, even when NetBeans changes them.


10.3. Preparing NetBeans for Vim		*netbeans-preparation*

In order for NetBeans to work with vim, the NetBeans External Editor module
must be loaded and enabled.  If you have a Sun ONE Studio Enterprise Edition
then this module should be loaded and enabled.  If you have a NetBeans release
you may need to find another way of obtaining this open source module.

You can check if you have this module by opening the Tools->Options dialog
and drilling down to the "Modules" list (IDE Configuration->System->Modules).
If your Modules list has an entry for "External Editor" you must make sure
it is enabled (the "Enabled" property should have the value "True").  If your
Modules list has no External Editor see the next section on |obtaining-exted|.


10.4. Obtaining the External Editor Module	*obtaining-exted*

There are 2 ways of obtaining the External Editor module.  The easiest way
is to use the NetBeans Update Center to download and install the module.
Unfortunately, some versions do not have this module in their update
center.  If you cannot download via the update center you will need to
download sources and build the module.  I will try and get the module
available from the NetBeans Update Center so building will be unnecessary.
Also check http://externaleditor.netbeans.org for other availability options.

To download the External Editor sources via CVS and build your own module,
see http://externaleditor.netbeans.org and http://www.netbeans.org.
Unfortunately, this is not a trivial procedure.


10.5. Setting up NetBeans to run with Vim	*netbeans-setup*

Assuming you have loaded and enabled the NetBeans External Editor module
as described in |netbeans-preparation| all you need to do is verify that
the gvim command line is properly configured for your environment.

Open the Tools->Options dialog and open the Editing category.  Select the
External Editor.  The right hand pane should contain a Properties tab and
an Expert tab.  In the Properties tab make sure the "Editor Type" is set
to "Vim".  In the Expert tab make sure the "Vim Command" is correct.

You should be careful if you change the "Vim Command".  There are command
line options there which must be there for the connection to be properly
set up.  You can change the command name but that's about it.  If your gvim
can be found by your $PATH then the VIM Command can start with "gvim".  If
you don't want gvim searched from your $PATH then hard code in the full
Unix path name.  At this point you should get a gvim for any source file
you open in NetBeans.

If some files come up in gvim and others (with different file suffixes) come
up in the default NetBeans editor you should verify the MIME type in the
Expert tab MIME Type property.  NetBeans is MIME oriented and the External
Editor will only open MIME types specified in this property.

Options							*options*

1. Setting options			|set-option|
2. Automatically setting options	|auto-setting|
3. Options summary			|option-summary|

For an overview of options see help.txt |option-list|.

Vim has a number of internal variables and switches which can be set to
achieve special effects.  These options come in three forms:
	boolean		can only be on or off		*boolean* *toggle*
	number		has a numeric value
	string		has a string value
