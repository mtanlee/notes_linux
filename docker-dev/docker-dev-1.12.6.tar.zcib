    Common folder locations:
    ========================
    kSystemDomain is generally /System and things inside it, so
     - kSystemDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is /System/Library/
     - kSystemDomain, kTrashFolderType is a trash folder on the same volume as /System ( the boot disk )
     - kSystemDomain, kDomainTopLevelFolderType is the root of the system domain, so it's the same as /System
    kLocalDomain is generally the admin-writeable, system-wide location for things, so
     - kLocalDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is /Library/
    kUserDomain maps to the current user's home folder, so that
     - kUserDomain, kCurrentUserFolderType is the user's home folder itself ( "$HOME", ~ )
     - kUserDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is the Library folder in the user home ( "$HOME/Library", "~/Library/" )
     - kUserDomain, kPreferencesFolderType is the Preferences folder in the user home ( "$HOME/Library/Preferences/" )
     - kUserDomain, kTrashFolderType is a trash folder on the same volume as the user home
    kNetworkDomain, if configured, is a network file system which a network administrator may have installed items into
     - kNetworkDomain, kApplicationsFolderType is /Network/Applications/
    kClassicDomain, if configured, is where the Mac OS X Classic environment information is stored
     - kClassicDomain, kSystemFolderType is the currently active Macintosh Classic system folder ( or fnfErr if a Classic isn't installed )

/*
 *  FindFolder()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains location information for system-related directories.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    For the folder type on the particular volume (specified,
 *    respectively, in the folderType and vRefNum parameters), the
 *    FindFolder function returns the directory's volume reference
 *    number in the foundVRefNum parameter and its directory ID in the
 *    foundDirID parameter.
 *    
 *    The specified folder used for a given volume might be located on
 *    a different volume in future versions of system software;
 *    therefore, do not assume the volume that you specify in vRefNum
 *    and the volume returned in foundVRefNum will be the same.
 *     
 *    Specify a volume reference number (or the constant kOnSystemDisk
 *    for the startup disk) or one of the domain constants ( on Mac OS
 *    X ) in the vRefNum parameter.
 *    
 *    Specify a four-character folder type--or the constant that
 *    represents it--in the folderType parameter.
 *    
 *    Use the constant kCreateFolder in the createFolder parameter to
 *    tell FindFolder to create a directory if it does not already
 *    exist; otherwise, use the constant kDontCreateFolder. Directories
 *    inside the System Folder are created only if the System Folder
 *    directory exists. The FindFolder function will not create a
 *    System Folder directory even if you specify the kCreateFolder
 *    constant in the createFolder parameter.
 *    
 *    The FindFolder function returns a nonzero result code if the
 *    folder isn't found, and it can also return other file system
 *    errors reported by the File Manager or Memory Manager.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    vRefNum:
 *      Pass the volume reference number of the volume on which you
 *      want to locate a directory, or a constant specifying a disk or
 *      domain.   The constants which you can use in this parameter are
 *      described in "Disk and Domain Constants".
 *      Note that, on Mac OS X, passing a volume reference number in
 *      this parameter does not make sense for most of the folder type
 *      selectors which you can specify in the folderType parameter. On
 *      Mac OS X, folders are "domain-oriented"; because there may be
 *      more than one domain on any given physical volume, asking for
 *      these folders on a per-volume basis yields undefined results.
 *      For example, if you were to request the Fonts folder
 *      (represented by the selector kFontsFolderType ) on volume -100,
 *      are you requesting the folder /System/Library/Fonts,
 *      /Library/Fonts, or ~/Fonts? On Mac OS X you should pass a disk
 *      or domain constant in this parameter.
 *    
 *    folderType:
 *      A four-character folder type, or a constant that represents the
 *      type, for the directory you want to find.
 *    
 *    createFolder:
 *      Pass the constant kCreateFolder in this parameter to create a
 *      directory if it does not already exist; otherwise, pass the
 *      constant kDontCreateFolder.
 *    
 *    foundVRefNum:
 *      The volume reference number, returned by FindFolder , for the
 *      volume containing the directory you specify in the folderType
 *      parameter.
 *    
 *    foundDirID:
 *      The directory ID number, returned by FindFolder , for the
 *      directory you specify in the folderType parameter.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 and later in CoreServices.framework
 *    CarbonLib:        in CarbonLib 1.0 and later

/*
 *  AddFolderDescriptor()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Copies the supplied information into a new folder descriptor
 *    entry in the system folder list. @discussion The
 *    AddFolderDescriptor function copies the supplied information into
 *    a new descriptor entry in the system folder list. You need to
 *    provide folder descriptors for each folder you wish the Folder
 *    Manager to be able to find via the function FindFolder. For
 *    example, a child folder located in a parent folder needs to have
 *    a descriptor created both for it and its parent folder, so that
 *    the child can be found. This function is supported under Mac OS 8
 *    and later. 
 *    On Mac OS X, folder descriptors added in one process are not
 *    visible in other processes.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    foldType:
 *      Pass a constant identifying the type of the folder you wish the
 *      Folder Manager to be able to find. See Folder Type Constants.
 *    
 *    flags:
 *      Set these flags to indicate whether a folder is created during
 *      startup, if the folder name is locked, and if the folder is
 *      created invisible; see Folder Descriptor Flags.
 *    
 *    foldClass:
 *      Pass the class of the folder which you wish the Folder Manager
 *      to be able to find. The folder class determines how the
 *      foldLocation parameter is interpreted. See "Folder Descriptor
 *      Classes" for a discussion of relative and special folder
 *      classes.
 *    
 *    foldLocation:
 *      For a relative folder, specify the folder type of the parent
 *      folder of the target. For a special folder, specify the
 *      location of the folder; see Folder Descriptor Locations.
 *    
 *    badgeSignature:
 *      Reserved. Pass 0.
 *    
 *    badgeType:
 *      Reserved. Pass 0.
 *    
 *    name:
 *      A string specifying the name of the desired folder. For
 *      relative folders, this is the exact name of the desired folder.
 *      For special folders, the actual target folder may have a
 *      different name than the name specified in the folder
 *      descriptor. For example, the System Folder is often given a
 *      different name, but it can still be located with FindFolder.
 *    
 *    replaceFlag:
 *      Pass a Boolean value indicating whether you wish to replace a
 *      folder descriptor that already exists for the specified folder
 *      type. If true , it replaces the folder descriptor for the
 *      specified folder type. If false , it does not replace the
 *      folder descriptor for the specified folder type.

 *      find a "to" folder see "Folder Type Constants" for descriptions
 *      of possible values. An item dropped on the folder specified in
 *      this parameter will be routed to the folder specified in the
 *      routeToFolder parameter.
 *    
 *    routeToFolder:
 *      A pointer to a value of type FolderType. On return, the value

 *  Summary:

 *      kOnAppropriateDisk to check whatever vRefNum is appropriate for
 *      the given FSSpec, or the value 0 to check all vRefNums and

/*
 *  Gestalt()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Gestalt returns information about the operating environment.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The Gestalt function places the information requested by the
 *    selector parameter in the variable parameter response . Note that
 *    Gestalt returns the response from all selectors in an SInt32,
 *    which occupies 4 bytes. When not all 4 bytes are needed, the
 *    significant information appears in the low-order byte or bytes.
 *    Although the response parameter is declared as a variable
 *    parameter, you cannot use it to pass information to Gestalt or to
 *    a Gestalt selector function. Gestalt interprets the response
 *    parameter as an address at which it is to place the result
 *    returned by the selector function specified by the selector
 *    parameter. Gestalt ignores any information already at that
 *    address.
 *    
 *    The Apple-defined selector codes fall into two categories:
 *    environmental selectors, which supply specific environmental
 *    information you can use to control the behavior of your
 *    application, and informational selectors, which supply
 *    information you can't use to determine what hardware or software
 *    features are available. You can use one of the selector codes
 *    defined by Apple (listed in the "Constants" section beginning on
 *    page 1-14 ) or a selector code defined by a third-party
 *    product.
 *    
 *    The meaning of the value that Gestalt returns in the response
 *    parameter depends on the selector code with which it was called.
 *    For example, if you call Gestalt using the gestaltTimeMgrVersion
 *    selector, it returns a version code in the response parameter. In
 *    this case, a returned value of 3 indicates that the extended Time
 *    Manager is available.
 *    
 *    In most cases, the last few characters in the selector's symbolic
 *    name form a suffix that indicates what type of value you can
 *    expect Gestalt to place in the response parameter. For example,
 *    if the suffix in a Gestalt selector is Size , then Gestalt
 *    returns a size in the response parameter.
 *    
 *    Attr:  A range of 32 bits, the meanings of which are defined by a
 *    list of constants. Bit 0 is the least significant bit of the
 *    SInt32.
 *    Count: A number indicating how many of the indicated type of item
 *    exist.
 *    Size: A size, usually in bytes.
 *    Table: The base address of a table.
 *    Type: An index to a list of feature descriptions.
 *    Version: A version number, which can be either a constant with a
 *    defined meaning or an actual version number, usually stored as
 *    four hexadecimal digits in the low-order word of the return
 *    value. Implied decimal points may separate digits. The value
 *    $0701, for example, returned in response to the
 *    gestaltSystemVersion selector, represents system software version
 *    7.0.1.
 *    
 *    Selectors that have the suffix Attr deserve special attention.
 *    They cause Gestalt to return a bit field that your application
 *    must interpret to determine whether a desired feature is present.
 *    For example, the application-defined sample function
 *    MyGetSoundAttr , defined in Listing 1-2 on page 1-6 , returns a
 *    LongInt that contains the Sound Manager attributes field
 *    retrieved from Gestalt . To determine whether a particular
 *    feature is available, you need to look at the designated bit.

    FORMAT OF gestaltATalkVersion RESPONSE
    --------------------------------------
    The version is stored in the high three bytes of the response value.  Let us number
    the bytes in the response value from 0 to 3, where 0 is the least-significant byte.

        Byte#:     3 2 1 0
        Value:  0xMMNNRR00

    Byte 3 (MM) contains the major revision number, byte 2 (NN) contains the minor
    revision number, and byte 1 (RR) contains a constant that represents the release
    stage.  Byte 0 always contains 0x00.  The constants for the release stages are:

        development = 0x20
        alpha       = 0x40
        beta        = 0x60
        final       = 0x80
        release     = 0x80

    For example, if you call Gestalt with the 'atkv' selector when AppleTalk version 57
    is loaded, you receive the integer response value 0x39008000.

    The gestaltNativeCPUtype ('cput') selector can be used to determine the
    native CPU type for all Macs running System 7.5 or later.

    However, the use of these selectors for pretty much anything is discouraged.
    If you are trying to determine if you can use a particular processor or
    operating system feature, it would be much better to check directly for that
    feature using one of the apis for doing so -- like, sysctl() or sysctlbyname().
    Those apis return information directly from the operating system and kernel.  By
    using those apis you may be able to avoid linking against Frameworks which you
    otherwise don't need, and may lessen the memory and code footprint of your
    applications.
    
    The gestaltNativeCPUfamily ('cpuf') selector can be used to determine the
    general family the native CPU is in.

    gestaltNativeCPUfamily uses the same results as gestaltNativeCPUtype, but
    will only return certain CPU values.
    
    IMPORTANT NOTE: gestaltNativeCPUFamily may no longer be updated for any new
                    processor families introduced after the 970.  If there are
                    processor specific features you need to be checking for in
                    your code, use one of the appropriate apis to get for those
                    exact features instead of assuming that all members of a given
                    cpu family exhibit the same behaviour.  The most appropriate api
                    to look at is sysctl() and sysctlbyname(), which return information
                    direct from the kernel about the system.

    MACHINE TYPE CONSTANTS NAMING CONVENTION

    Line Names

        The following table contains the lines currently produced by Apple and the
        lineName substrings associated with them:

            Line                        lineName
            -------------------------   ------------
            Macintosh LC                "MacLC"
            Macintosh Performa          "Performa"
            Macintosh PowerBook         "PowerBook"
            Macintosh PowerBook Duo     "PowerBookDuo"
            Power Macintosh             "PowerMac"
            Apple Workgroup Server      "AWS"

        The following table contains lineNames for some discontinued lines:

            Line                        lineName
            -------------------------   ------------
            Macintosh Quadra            "MacQuadra" (preferred)
                                        "Quadra" (also used, but not preferred)
            Macintosh Centris           "MacCentris"

    Model Numbers

        The modelNumber is a string representing the specific model of the machine
        within its particular line.  For example, for the Power Macintosh 8100/80,
        the modelNumber is "8100".

        Some Performa & LC model numbers contain variations in the rightmost 1 or 2
        digits to indicate different RAM and Hard Disk configurations.  A single
        machine type is assigned for all variations of a specific model number.  In
        this case, the modelNumber string consists of the constant leftmost part
        of the model number with 0s for the variant digits.  For example, the
        Performa 6115 and Performa 6116 are both return the same machine type
        constant:  gestaltPerforma6100.


    OLD NAMING CONVENTIONS

    The "Underscore Speed" suffix

        In the past, Apple differentiated between machines that had the same model
        number but different speeds.  For example, the Power Macintosh 8100/80 and
        Power Macintosh 8100/100 return different machine type constants.  This is
        why some existing machine type constant names take the form:

            gestalt<lineName><modelNumber>_<speed>

        e.g.

            gestaltPowerMac8100_110
            gestaltPowerMac7100_80
            gestaltPowerMac7100_66

        It is no longer necessary to use the "underscore speed" suffix.  Starting with
        the Power Surge machines (Power Macintosh 7200, 7500, 8500 and 9500), speed is
        no longer used to differentiate between machine types.  This is why a Power
        Macintosh 7200/75 and a Power Macintosh 7200/90 return the same machine type
        constant:  gestaltPowerMac7200.

    The "Screen Type" suffix

        All PowerBook models prior to the PowerBook 190, and all PowerBook Duo models
        before the PowerBook Duo 2300 take the form:

            gestalt<lineName><modelNumber><screenType>

        Where <screenType> is "c" or the empty string.

        e.g.

            gestaltPowerBook100

                      ^    minor rev                         ^  minor rev   =  2
                       ^   bug fix rev                        ^ bug fix rev =  3
    
    If the values of the minor or bug fix revision are larger than 9, then
    gestaltSystemVersion will substitute the value 9 for them.  For example,
    Mac OS X 10.3.15 will be returned as 0x1039, and Mac OS X 10.10.5 will
    return 0x1095.
    
    A better way to get version information with the deprecated Gestalt API
	would be to use the gestaltSystemVersionMajor, gestaltSystemVersionMinor,
    and gestaltSystemVersionBugFix selectors, which don't have arbitrary limits
    on the values returned. However, because Gestalt is deprecated, you should
	use NSProcessInfo's operatingSystemVersion property instead.
 
    If you want to know the product build version string, product name, or
    the user visible version string you should read in the system version
    information from the file /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist.

 * Note that this type assumes a particular ordering of code and tables, although

 *
 * There is some ugly stuff at the end, because
 * 1. The itl2 resource has several different formats.
 * 2. The offset to the FindScriptTable is only present in one format: when length
 *    fields exist.
 * 3. Even in that format, the FindScriptTable itself is optional; if it is not
 *    present, the offset to it is 0.
 * 4. The optional FindScriptTable is preceded by the variable-length wrapTable.
 *    To determine the wrapTable length when DeRezzing, we need to use the offset
 *    to FindScriptTable if the offset exists and is nonzero. Otherwise, wrapTable
 *    extends to the end of the resource.
 * The single hex string at the end of the wrapTable is actually represented in
 * three different arrays whose dimensions are logical expressions. For a given

 *    and RegionCode values.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    localeString:
 *      A null-terminated C-string version of a CFLocale-style locale
 *      identifier of the sort that could be passed to
 *      CFLocaleCreateCanonicalLocaleIdentifierFromString, based on BCP
 *      47 language tags: <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt>.
 *    
 *    lang:
 *      A pointer to a LangCode to be set from the locale identifier;
 *      will be set to langUnspecified or -1 if no language code can be
 *      derived from the identifier. May be NULL if region is not also
 *      NULL.
 *    
 *    region:
 *      A pointer to a RegionCode to be set from the locale identifier;
 *      will be set to -1 if no language code can be derived from the
 *      identifier. May be NULL if lang is not also NULL.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    OSStatus, noErr if operation successful, otherwise paramErr or
 *    possibly other errors.

 *    The HLock procedure locks the relocatable block to which h is a
 *    handle, preventing it from being moved within its heap zone. If
 *    the block is already locked,HLock does nothing.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, the behaviour of the Memory Manager and of heaps in
 *    general is different than on Mac OS 9.x and earlier. In
 *    particular, the heap on Mac OS X is never purged or compacted. 
 *    Therefore, an unlocked handle will never be relocated except as a
 *    result of a direct action by something calling SetHandleSize() or
 *    by using a function like PtrAndHand() which implicitly resizes
 *    the handle to append data to it.  Because of this, most locking
 *    and unlocking of handles is unnecessary on Mac OS X, and the use
 *    of HLock() and other functions is being deprecated.  If you
 *    define a macro named __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ to 1 in
 *    your sources before you include MacMemory.h, then HLock() and
 *    several other functions will become empty operations, removing
 *    the overhead of a function call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications are relying on the behavior that
 *    resizing a locked handle produces an error, or tracking the state
 *    of the locked bit for a give handle via the HGetState() function.
 *     Applications which rely on this can not use

 *  Discussion:
 *    The HPurge procedure makes the relocatable block to which h is a

 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, heaps are never purged.  Therefore, the use of

 *    you include MacMemory.h, then any calls to HPurge() in your
 *    program will essentially be removed.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may set the handle as purgeable, and

 *  TempNewHandle()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Allocate a relocatable memory block of a specified size.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The TempNewHandle function attempts to allocate a new relocatable
 *    block in the current heap zone with a logical size of logicalSize
 *    bytes and then return a handle to the block. The new block is
 *    unlocked and unpurgeable. If NewHandle cannot allocate a block of
 *    the requested size, it returns NULL.  The memory block returned
 *    likely will contain garbage.
 *    
 *    WARNING
 *    
 *    Do not try to manufacture your own handles without this function
 *    by simply assigning the address of a variable of type Ptr to a
 *    variable of type Handle. The resulting "fake handle" would not
 *    reference a relocatable block and could cause a system crash.
 *     If this function returns NIL, the error result can be determined
 *    by calling the function MemError().
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, there is no temporary memory heap, and thus no
 *    difference between the handles returned by TempNewHandle() and
 *    those returned by NewHandle().  The only difference between the
 *    two is that TempNewHandle() also returns the error result of the
 *    call in resultCode.

 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *  Parameters:

 *    logicalSize:

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The EmptyHandle function purges the relocatable block whose
 *    handle is h and sets the handles master pointer to NULL. The
 *    EmptyHandle function allows you to free memory taken by a
 *    relocatable block without freeing the relocatable blocks master

 *    unlocked but need not be purgeable.
 *    
 *    Note that if there are multiple handles to the relocatable block,
 *    then calling the EmptyHandle function empties them all, because
 *    all of the handles share a common master pointer. When you later
 *    use ReallocateHandle to reallocate space for the block, the
 *    master pointer is updated, and all of the handles reference the
 *    new block correctly.

 *    To free the memory taken up by a relocatable block and release

/*
 *  HGetState()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Get the current state of the handle's locked, purgeable, and R
 *    bits
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HGetState function returns a signed byte (char) containing
 *    the flags of the master pointer for the given handle. You can
 *    save this byte, change the state of any of the flags using the
 *    functions described in this section, and then restore their
 *    original states by passing the byte to the HSetState
 *    function.
 *    
 *    You can use bit-manipulation functions on the returned signed
 *    byte to determine the value of a given attribute.
 *    Currently the following bits are used:
 *    kHandleIsResourceBit    - if set, handle is a resource
 *     kHandlePurgeableBit - if set, handle is purgeable
 *     kHandleLockedBit - if set, handle is locked
 *    On Mac OS X and later, heaps are never purged, so the purgeable
 *    bit is used but its setting is essentially ignored. Also, since
 *    heaps are never compacted, and therefore the only time a handle
 *    moves is when that handle is resized, the danger of using
 *    defererenced handles is lower and so handles likely do not need
 *    to be locked as often. Because of this, the state for a handle is
 *    less useful, and HGetState() and other functions is being
 *    deprecated.  If you define a macro named
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ in your sources before you
 *    include MacMemory.h, then HGetState() and several other functions
 *    will become empty operations, removing the overhead of a function
 *    call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may depend on the state bits of a
 *    handle being correct or changing as functions like HLock(), etc.,
 *    are called.  Applications which rely on this can not use
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__.
