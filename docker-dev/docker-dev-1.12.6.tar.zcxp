ed with 0x) or octal (preceded with '0')
			(hex and octal are only available for machines which
			have the strtol() function).
			The old value can be inserted by typing 'wildchar' (by
			default this is a <Tab> or CTRL-E if 'compatible' is
			set).  See |cmdline-completion|.
			White space between {option} and '=' is allowed and
			will be ignored.  White space between '=' and {value}
			is not allowed.
			See |option-backslash| for using white space and
			backslashes in {value}.

:se[t] {option}+={value}				*:set+=*
			Add the {value} to a number option, or append the
			{value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			If the option is a list of flags, superfluous flags
			are removed.  When adding a flag that was already
			present the option value doesn't change.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}^={value}				*:set^=*
			Multiply the {value} to a number option, or prepend
			the {value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}-={value}				*:set-=*
			Subtract the {value} from a number option, or remove
			the {value} from a string option, if it is there.
			If the {value} is not found in a string option, there
			is no error or warning.  When the option is a comma
			separated list, a comma is deleted, unless the option
			becomes empty.
			When the option is a list of flags, {value} must be
			exactly as they appear in the option.  Remove flags
			one by one to avoid problems.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

The {option} arguments to ":set" may be repeated.  For example: >
	:set ai nosi sw=3 ts=3
If you make an error in one of the arguments, an error message will be given
and the following arguments will be ignored.

							*:set-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, displaying an option value will also tell where it
was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose set shiftwidth cindent?
<	  shiftwidth=4 ~
		  Last set from modeline ~
	  cindent ~
		  Last set from /usr/local/share/vim/vim60/ftplugin/c.vim ~
This is only done when specific option values are requested, not for ":verbose
set all" or ":verbose set" without an argument.
When the option was set by hand there is no "Last set" message.
When the option was set while executing a function, user command or
autocommand, the script in which it was defined is reported.
Note that an option may also have been set as a side effect of setting
'compatible'.
A few special texts:
	Last set from modeline ~
		Option was set in a |modeline|.
	Last set from --cmd argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |--cmd| or +.
	Last set from -c argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |-c|, +, |-S| or
		|-q|.
	Last set from environment variable ~
		Option was set from an environment variable, $VIMINIT,
		$GVIMINIT or $EXINIT.
	Last set from error handler ~
		Option was cleared when evaluating it resulted in an error.

{not available when compiled without the |+eval| feature}

							*:set-termcap* *E522*
For {option} the form "t_xx" may be used to set a terminal option.  This will
override the value from the termcap.  You can then use it in a mapping.  If
the "xx" part contains special characters, use the <t_xx> form: >
	:set <t_#4>=^[Ot
This can also be used to translate a special code for a normal key.  For
example, if Alt-b produces <Esc>b, use this: >
	:set <M-b>=^[b
(the ^[ is a real <Esc> here, use CTRL-V <Esc> to enter it)
The advantage over a mapping is that it works in all situations.

You can define any key codes, e.g.: >
	:set t_xy=^[foo;
There is no warning for using a name that isn't recognized.  You can map these
codes as you like: >
	:map <t_xy> something
<								*E846*
When a key code is not set, it's like it does not exist.  Trying to get its
value will result in an error: >
	:set t_kb=
	:set t_kb
	E846: Key code not set: t_kb

The t_xx options cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
security reasons.

The listing from ":set" looks different from Vi.  Long string options are put
at the end of the list.  The number of options is quite large.  The output of
"set all" probably does not fit on the screen, causing Vim to give the
|more-prompt|.

							*option-backslash*
To include white space in a string option value it has to be preceded with a
backslash.  To include a backslash you have to use two.  Effectively this
means that the number of backslashes in an option value is halved (rounded
down).
A few examples: >
   :set tags=tags\ /usr/tags	    results in "tags /usr/tags"
   :set tags=tags\\,file	    results in "tags\,file"
   :set tags=tags\\\ file	    results in "tags\ file"

The "|" character separates a ":set" command from a following command.  To
include the "|" in the option value, use "\|" instead.  This example sets the
'titlestring' option to "hi|there": >
   :set titlestring=hi\|there
This sets the 'titlestring' option to "hi" and 'iconstring' to "there": >
   :set titlestring=hi|set iconstring=there

Similarly, the double quote character starts a comment.  To include the '"' in
the option value, use '\"' instead.  This example sets the 'titlestring'
option to 'hi "there"': >
   :set titlestring=hi\ \"there\"

For MS-DOS and WIN32 backslashes in file names are mostly not removed.  More
precise: For options that expect a file name (those where environment
variables are expanded) a backslash before a normal file name character is not
removed.  But a backslash before a special character (space, backslash, comma,
etc.) is used like explained above.
There is one special situation, when the value starts with "\\": >
   :set dir=\\machine\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\\\machine\\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\path\\file	    results in "\\path\file" (wrong!)
For the first one the start is kept, but for the second one the backslashes
are halved.  This makes sure it works both when you expect backslashes to be
halved and when you expect the backslashes to be kept.  The third gives a
result which is probably not what you want.  Avoid it.

				*add-option-flags* *remove-option-flags*
				*E539* *E550* *E551* *E552*
Some options are a list of flags.  When you want to add a flag to such an
option, without changing the existing ones, you can do it like this: >
   :set guioptions+=a
Remove a flag from an option like this: >
   :set guioptions-=a
This removes the 'a' flag from 'guioptions'.
Note that you should add or remove one flag at a time.  If 'guioptions' has
the value "ab", using "set guioptions-=ba" won't work, because the string "ba"
doesn't appear.

			   *:set_env* *expand-env* *expand-environment-var*
Environment variables in specific string options will be expanded.  If the
environment variable exists the '$' and the following environment variable
name is replaced with its value.  If it does not exist the '$' and the name
are not modified.  Any non-id character (not a letter, digit or '_') may
follow the environment variable name.  That character and what follows is
appended to the value of the environment variable.  Examples: >
   :set term=$TERM.new
   :set path=/usr/$INCLUDE,$HOME/include,.
When adding or removing a string from an option with ":set opt-=val" or ":set
opt+=val" the expansion is done before the adding or removing.


Handling of local options			*local-options*

Some of the options only apply to a window or buffer.  Each window or buffer
has its own copy of this option, thus can each have their own value.  This
allows you to set 'list' in one window but not in another.  And set
'shiftwidth' to 3 in one buffer and 4 in another.

The following explains what happens to these local options in specific
situations.  You don't really need to know all of this, since Vim mostly uses
the option values you would expect.  Unfortunately, doing what the user
expects is a bit complicated...

When splitting a window, the local options are copied to the new window.  Thus
right after the split the contents of the two windows look the same.

When editing a new buffer, its local option values must be initialized.  Since
the local options of the current buffer might be specifically for that buffer,
these are not used.  Instead, for each buffer-local option there also is a
global value, which is used for new buffers.  With ":set" both the local and
global value is changed.  With "setlocal" only the local value is changed,
thus this value is not used when editing a new buffer.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used window
options are used again.  If this buffer has been edited in this window, the
values from back then are used.  Otherwise the values from the window where
the buffer was edited last are used.

It's possible to set a local window option specifically for a type of buffer.
When you edit another buffer in the same window, you don't want to keep
using these local window options.  Therefore Vim keeps a global value of the
local window options, which is used when editing another buffer.  Each window
has its own copy of these values.  Thus these are local to the window, but
global to all buffers in the window.  With this you can do: >
	:e one
	:set list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option will also be set in "two", since with the ":set list"
command you have also set the global value. >
	:set nolist
	:e one
	:setlocal list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option is not set, because ":set nolist" resets the global
value, ":setlocal list" only changes the local value and ":e two" gets the
global value.  Note that if you do this next: >
	:e one
You will get back the 'list' value as it was the last time you edited "one".
The options local to a window are remembered for each buffer.  This also
happens when the buffer is not loaded, but they are lost when the buffer is
wiped out |:bwipe|.

							*:setl* *:setlocal*
:setl[ocal] ...		Like ":set" but set only the value local to the
			current buffer or window.  Not all options have a
			local value.  If the option does not have a local
			value the global value is set.
			With the "all" argument: display local values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: Display local values for all local
			options which are different from the default.
			When displaying a specific local option, show the
			local value.  For a global/local boolean option, when
			the global value is being used, "--" is displayed
			before the option name.
			For a global option the global value is
			shown (but that might change in the future).
			{not in Vi}

:setl[ocal] {option}<	Set the local value of {option} to its global value by
			copying the value.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}<	For |global-local| options: Remove the local value of
			{option}, so that the global value will be used.
			{not in Vi}

							*:setg* *:setglobal*
:setg[lobal] ...	Like ":set" but set only the global value for a local
			option without changing the local value.
			When displaying an option, the global value is shown.
			With the "all" argument: display global values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: display global values for all local
			options which are different from the default.
			{not in Vi}

For buffer-local and window-local options:
	Command		 global value	    local value ~
      :set option=value	     set		set
 :setlocal option=value	      -			set
:setglobal option=value	     set		 -
      :set option?	      -		       display
 :setlocal option?	      -		       display
:setglobal option?	    display		 -


Global options with a local value			*global-local*

Options are global when you mostly use one value for all buffers and windows.
For some global options it's useful to sometimes have a different local value.
You can set the local value with ":setlocal".  That buffer or window will then
use the local value, while other buffers and windows continue using the global
value.

For example, you have two windows, both on C source code.  They use the global
'makeprg' option.  If you do this in one of the two windows: >
	:set makeprg=gmake
then the other window will switch to the same value.  There is no need to set
the 'makeprg' option in the other C source window too.
However, if you start editing a Perl file in a new window, you want to use
another 'makeprg' for it, without changing the value used for the C source
files.  You use this command: >
	:setlocal makeprg=perlmake
You can switch back to using the global value by making the local value empty: >
	:setlocal makeprg=
This only works for a string option.  For a boolean option you need to use the
"<" flag, like this: >
	:setlocal autoread<
Note that for non-boolean options using "<" copies the global value to the
local value, it doesn't switch back to using the global value (that matters
when the global value changes later).  You can also use: >
	:set path<
This will make the local value of 'path' empty, so that the global value is
used.  Thus it does the same as: >
	:setlocal path=
Note: In the future more global options can be made global-local.  Using
":setlocal" on a global option might work differently then.


Setting the filetype

:setf[iletype] {filetype}			*:setf* *:setfiletype*
			Set the 'filetype' option to {filetype}, but only if
			not done yet in a sequence of (nested) autocommands.
			This is short for: >
				:if !did_filetype()
				:  setlocal filetype={filetype}
				:endif
<			This command is used in a filetype.vim file to avoid
			setting the 'filetype' option twice, causing different
			settings and syntax files to be loaded.
			{not in Vi}

				*option-window* *optwin*
:bro[wse] se[t]			*:set-browse* *:browse-set* *:opt* *:options*
:opt[ions]		Open a window for viewing and setting all options.
			Options are grouped by function.
			Offers short help for each option.  Hit <CR> on the
			short help to open a help window with more help for
			the option.
			Modify the value of the option and hit <CR> on the
			"set" line to set the new value.  For window and
			buffer specific options, the last accessed window is
			used to set the option value in, unless this is a help
			window, in which case the window below help window is
			used (skipping the option-window).
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval| or
			|+autocmd| features}

								*$HOME*
Using "~" is like using "$HOME", but it is only recognized at the start of an
option and after a space or comma.

On Unix systems "~user" can be used too.  It is replaced by the home directory
of user "user".  Example: >
    :set path=~mool/include,/usr/include,.

On Unix systems the form "${HOME}" can be used too.  The name between {} can
contain non-id characters then.  Note that if you want to use this for the
"gf" command, you need to add the '{' and '}' characters to 'isfname'.

On MS-Windows, if $HOME is not defined as an environment variable, then
at runtime Vim will set it to the expansion of $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH.

NOTE: expanding environment variables and "~/" is only done with the ":set"
command, not when assigning a value to an option with ":let".


Note the maximum length of an expanded option is limited.  How much depends on
the system, mostly it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.

							*:fix* *:fixdel*
:fix[del]		Set the value of 't_kD':
				't_kb' is     't_kD' becomes	~
				  CTRL-?	CTRL-H
				not CTRL-?	CTRL-?

			(CTRL-? is 0177 octal, 0x7f hex) {not in Vi}

			If your delete key terminal code is wrong, but the
			code for backspace is alright, you can put this in
			your .vimrc: >
				:fixdel
<			This works no matter what the actual code for
			backspace is.

			If the backspace key terminal code is wrong you can
			use this: >
				:if &term == "termname"
				:  set t_kb=^V<BS>
				:  fixdel
				:endif
<			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<BS>" is the backspace key
			(don't type four characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

			If your <Delete> key sends a strange key sequence (not
			CTRL-? or CTRL-H) you cannot use ":fixdel".  Then use: >
				:if &term == "termname"
				:  set t_kD=^V<Delete>
				:endif
<			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<Delete>" is the delete key
			(don't type eight characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

							*Linux-backspace*
			Note about Linux: By default the backspace key
			produces CTRL-?, which is wrong.  You can fix it by
			putting this line in your rc.local: >
				echo "keycode 14 = BackSpace" | loadkeys
<
							*NetBSD-backspace*
			Note about NetBSD: If your backspace doesn't produce
			the right code, try this: >
				xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
<			If this works, add this in your .Xmodmap file: >
				keysym 22 = BackSpace
<			You need to restart for this to take effect.

==============================================================================
2. Automatically setting options			*auto-setting*

Besides changing options with the ":set" command, there are three alternatives
to set options automatically for one or more files:

1. When starting Vim initializations are read from various places.  See
   |initialization|.  Most of them are performed for all editing sessions,
   and some of them depend on the directory where Vim is started.
   You can create an initialization file with |:mkvimrc|, |:mkview| and
   |:mksession|.
2. If you start editing a new file, the automatic commands are executed.
   This can be used to set options for files matching a particular pattern and
   many other things.  See |autocommand|.
3. If you start editing a new file, and the 'modeline' option is on, a
   number of lines at the beginning and end of the file are checked for
   modelines.  This is explained here.

					*modeline* *vim:* *vi:* *ex:* *E520*
There are two forms of modelines.  The first form:
	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]{options}

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|ex:}		the string "vi:", "vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
{options}		a list of option settings, separated with white space
			or ':', where each part between ':' is the argument
			for a ":set" command (can be empty)

Examples:
   vi:noai:sw=3 ts=6 ~
   vim: tw=77 ~

The second form (this is compatible with some versions of Vi):

	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}[white]se[t] {options}:[text]

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}	the string "vi:", "vim:", "Vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
se[t]			the string "set " or "se " (note the space); When
			"Vim" is used it must be "set".
{options}		a list of options, separated with white space, which
			is the argument for a ":set" command
:			a colon
[text]			any text or empty

Examples:
   /* vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~
   /* Vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~

The white space before {vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:} is required.  This minimizes the
chance that a normal word like "lex:" is caught.  There is one exception:
"vi:" and "vim:" can also be at the start of the line (for compatibility with
version 3.0).  Using "ex:" at the start of the line will be ignored (this
could be short for "example:").

							*modeline-local*
The options are set like with ":setlocal": The new value only applies to the
buffer and window that contain the file.  Although it's possible to set global
options from a modeline, this is unusual.  If you have two windows open and
the files in it set the same global option to a different value, the result
depends on which one was opened last.

When editing a file that was already loaded, only the window-local options
from the modeline are used.  Thus if you manually changed a buffer-local
option after opening the file, it won't be changed if you edit the same buffer
in another window.  But window-local options will be set.

							*modeline-version*
If the modeline is only to be used for some versions of Vim, the version
number can be specified where "vim:" or "Vim:" is used:
	vim{vers}:	version {vers} or later
	vim<{vers}:	version before {vers}
	vim={vers}:	version {vers}
	vim>{vers}:	version after {vers}
{vers} is 600 for Vim 6.0 (hundred times the major version plus minor).
For example, to use a modeline only for Vim 6.0 and later:
	/* vim600: set foldmethod=marker: */ ~
To use a modeline for Vim before version 5.7:
	/* vim<570: set sw=4: */ ~
There can be no blanks between "vim" and the ":".


The number of lines that are checked can be set with the 'modelines' option.
If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is 0 no lines are checked.

Note that for the first form all of the rest of the line is used, thus a line
like:
   /* vi:ts=4: */ ~
will give an error message for the trailing "*/".  This line is OK:
   /* vi:set ts=4: */ ~

If an error is detected the rest of the line is skipped.

If you want to include a ':' in a set command precede it with a '\'.  The
backslash in front of the ':' will be removed.  Example:
   /* vi:set dir=c\:\tmp: */ ~
This sets the 'dir' option to "c:\tmp".  Only a single backslash before the
':' is removed.  Thus to include "\:" you have to specify "\\:".

No other commands than "set" are supported, for security reasons (somebody
might create a Trojan horse text file with modelines).  And not all options
can be set.  For some options a flag is set, so that when it's used the
|sandbox| is effective.  Still, there is always a small risk that a modeline
causes trouble.  E.g., when some joker sets 'textwidth' to 5 all your lines
are wrapped unexpectedly.  So disable modelines before editing untrusted text.
The mail ftplugin does this, for example.

Hint: If you would like to do something else than setting an option, you could
define an autocommand that checks the file for a specific string.  For
example: >
	au BufReadPost * if getline(1) =~ "VAR" | call SetVar() | endif
And define a function SetVar() that does something with the line containing
"VAR".

==============================================================================
3. Options summary					*option-summary*

In the list below all the options are mentioned with their full name and with
an abbreviation if there is one.  Both forms may be used.

In this document when a boolean option is "set" that means that ":set option"
is entered.  When an option is "reset", ":set nooption" is used.

For some options there are two default values: The "Vim default", which is
used when 'compatible' is not set, and the "Vi default", which is used when
'compatible' is set.

Most options are the same in all windows and buffers.  There are a few that
are specific to how the text is presented in a window.  These can be set to a
different value in each window.  For example the 'list' option can be set in
one window and reset in another for the same text, giving both types of view
at the same time.  There are a few options that are specific to a certain
file.  These can have a different value for each file or buffer.  For example
the 'textwidth' option can be 78 for a normal text file and 0 for a C
program.

	global			one option for all buffers and windows
	local to window		each window has its own copy of this option
	local to buffer		each buffer has its own copy of this option

When creating a new window the option values from the currently active window
are used as a default value for the window-specific options.  For the
buffer-specific options this depends on the 's' and 'S' flags in the
'cpoptions' option.  If 's' is included (which is the default) the values for
buffer options are copied from the currently active buffer when a buffer is
first entered.  If 'S' is present the options are copied each time the buffer
is entered, this is almost like having global options.  If 's' and 'S' are not
present, the options are copied from the currently active buffer when the
buffer is created.

Hidden options						*hidden-options*

Not all options are supported in all versions.  This depends on the supported
features and sometimes on the system.  A remark about this is in curly braces
below.  When an option is not supported it may still be set without getting an
error, this is called a hidden option.  You can't get the value of a hidden
option though, it is not stored.

To test if option "foo" can be used with ":set" use something like this: >
	if exists('&foo')
This also returns true for a hidden option.  To test if option "foo" is really
supported use something like this: >
	if exists('+foo')
<
							*E355*
A jump table for the options with a short description can be found at |Q_op|.

					*'aleph'* *'al'* *aleph* *Aleph*
'aleph' 'al'		number	(default 128 for MS-DOS, 224 otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	The ASCII code for the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The
	routine that maps the keyboard in Hebrew mode, both in Insert mode
	(when hkmap is set) and on the command-line (when hitting CTRL-_)
	outputs the Hebrew characters in the range [aleph..aleph+26].
	aleph=128 applies to PC code, and aleph=224 applies to ISO 8859-8.
	See |rileft.txt|.

			*'allowrevins'* *'ari'* *'noallowrevins'* *'noari'*
'allowrevins' 'ari'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Allow CTRL-_ in Insert and Command-line mode.  This is default off, to
	avoid that users that accidentally type CTRL-_ instead of SHIFT-_ get
	into reverse Insert mode, and don't know how to get out.  See
	'revins'.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			 *'altkeymap'* *'akm'* *'noaltkeymap'* *'noakm'*
'altkeymap' 'akm'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+farsi|
			feature}
	When on, the second language is Farsi.  In editing mode CTRL-_ toggles
	the keyboard map between Farsi and English, when 'allowrevins' set.

	When off, the keyboard map toggles between Hebrew and English.  This
	is useful to start the Vim in native mode i.e. English (left-to-right
	mode) and have default second language Farsi or Hebrew (right-to-left
	mode).  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'ambiwidth'* *'ambw'*
'ambiwidth' 'ambw'	string (default: "single")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Only effective when 'encoding' is "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding.
	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
	letters, Cyrillic letters).

	There are currently two possible values:
	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
			expected by most users.
	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
							*E834* *E835*
	The value "double" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'
	contains a character that would be double width.

	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
	to be set to "double" under CJK Windows 9x/ME or Windows 2k/XP
	when the system locale is set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode
	Standard Annex #11 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

	Vim may set this option automatically at startup time when Vim is
	compiled with the |+termresponse| feature and if |t_u7| is set to the
	escape sequence to request cursor position report.

			*'antialias'* *'anti'* *'noantialias'* *'noanti'*
'antialias' 'anti'	boolean (default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled
			on Mac OS X}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim on Mac OS X
	v10.2 or later.  When on, Vim will use smooth ("antialiased") fonts,
	which can be easier to read at certain sizes on certain displays.
	Setting this option can sometimes cause problems if 'guifont' is set
	to its default (empty string).

			*'autochdir'* *'acd'* *'noautochdir'* *'noacd'*
'autochdir' 'acd'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with it, use
			exists("+autochdir") to check}
	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
	or selected.
	This option is provided for backward compatibility with the Vim
	released with Sun ONE Studio 4 Enterprise Edition.
	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

				*'arabic'* *'arab'* *'noarabic'* *'noarab'*
'arabic' 'arab'		boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	This option can be set to start editing Arabic text.
	Setting this option will:
	- Set the 'rightleft' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'arabicshape' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'keymap' option to "arabic"; in Insert mode CTRL-^ toggles
	  between typing English and Arabic key mapping.
	- Set the 'delcombine' option
	Note that 'encoding' must be "utf-8" for working with Arabic text.

	Resetting this option will:
	- Reset the 'rightleft' option.
	- Disable the use of 'keymap' (without changing its value).
	Note that 'arabicshape' and 'delcombine' are not reset (it is a global
	option).
	Also see |arabic.txt|.

					*'arabicshape'* *'arshape'*
					*'noarabicshape'* *'noarshape'*
'arabicshape' 'arshape'	boolean (default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	When on and 'termbidi' is off, the required visual character
	corrections that need to take place for displaying the Arabic language
	take effect.  Shaping, in essence, gets enabled; the term is a broad
	one which encompasses:
	  a) the changing/morphing of characters based on their location
	     within a word (initial, medial, final and stand-alone).
	  b) the enabling of the ability to compose characters
	  c) the enabling of the required combining of some characters
	When disabled the display shows each character's true stand-alone
	form.
	Arabic is a complex language which requires other settings, for
	further details see |arabic.txt|.

			*'autoindent'* *'ai'* *'noautoindent'* *'noai'*
'autoindent' 'ai'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
	to another line has the same effect, unless the 'I' flag is included
	in 'cpoptions'.
	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
	reach 'textwidth' in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
	line.
	When 'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on the indent is changed in
	a different way.
	The 'autoindent' option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

				 *'autoread'* *'ar'* *'noautoread'* *'noar'*
'autoread' 'ar'		boolean	(default off)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and
	it has not been changed inside of Vim, automatically read it again.
	When the file has been deleted this is not done.  |timestamp|
	If this option has a local value, use this command to switch back to
	using the global value: >
		:set autoread<
<
				 *'autowrite'* *'aw'* *'noautowrite'* *'noaw'*
'autowrite' 'aw'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
	:next, :rewind, :last, :first, :previous, :stop, :suspend, :tag, :!,
	:make, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when a :buffer, CTRL-O, CTRL-I,
	'{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one to another file.
	Note that for some commands the 'autowrite' option is not used, see
	'autowriteall' for that.

			 *'autowriteall'* *'awa'* *'noautowriteall'* *'noawa'*
'autowriteall' 'awa'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Like 'autowrite', but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like 'autowrite' has
	been set.

							*'background'* *'bg'*
'background' 'bg'	string	(default "dark" or "light", see below)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set to "dark", Vim will try to use colors that look good on a
	dark background.  When set to "light", Vim will try to use colors that
	look good on a light background.  Any other value is illegal.
	Vim tries to set the default value according to the terminal used.
	This will not always be correct.
	Setting this option does not change the background color, it tells Vim
	what the background color looks like.  For changing the background
	color, see |:hi-normal|.

	When 'background' is set Vim will adjust the default color groups for
	the new value.  But the colors used for syntax highlighting will not
	change.					*g:colors_name*
	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
	setting 'background' will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
	the color scheme adjusts to the value of 'background' this will work.
	However, if the color scheme sets 'background' itself the effect may
	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.

	When setting 'background' to the default value with: >
		:set background&
<	Vim will guess the value.  In the GUI this should work correctly,
	in other cases Vim might not be able to guess the right value.

	When starting the GUI, the default value for 'background' will be
	"light".  When the value is not set in the .gvimrc, and Vim detects
	that the background is actually quite dark, 'background' is set to
	"dark".  But this happens only AFTER the .gvimrc file has been read
	(because the window needs to be opened to find the actual background
	color).  To get around this, force the GUI window to be opened by
	putting a ":gui" command in the .gvimrc file, before where the value
	of 'background' is used (e.g., before ":syntax on").

	For MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2 the default is "dark".
	For other systems "dark" is used when 'term' is "linux",
	"screen.linux", "cygwin" or "putty", or $COLORFGBG suggests a dark
	background.  Otherwise the default is "light".

	Normally this option would be set in the .vimrc file.  Possibly
	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
		:if &term == "pcterm"
		:  set background=dark
		:endif
<	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
	the setting of the 'background' option.
	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
	done with ":syntax on".

							*'backspace'* *'bs'*
'backspace' 'bs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
	a way to backspace over something:
	value	effect	~
	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
		stop once at the start of insert.

	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used.

	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
	value	effect	~
	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"

	See |:fixdel| if your <BS> or <Del> key does not do what you want.
	NOTE: This option is set to "" when 'compatible' is set.

				*'backup'* *'bk'* *'nobackup'* *'nobk'*
'backup' 'bk'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
	written, reset this option and set the 'writebackup' option (this is
	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
	|backup-table| for more explanations.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
	When 'patchmode' is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
	oldest version of a file.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'backupcopy'* *'bkc'*
'backupcopy' 'bkc'	string	(Vi default for Unix: "yes", otherwise: "auto")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
	done.  This is a comma separated list of words.

	The main values are:
	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best

	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing

	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
	  not of the real file.

	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
	+ It's fast.
	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
	  file.
	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.

	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming file
	is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on and
	the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected, a
	copy will be made.

	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
	be propagated back to the original source.
							*crontab*
	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
	example.

	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file
	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
	others.

	When the file is renamed this is the other way around: The backup has
	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
	again not rename the file.

						*'backupdir'* *'bdir'*
'backupdir' 'bdir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,$TEMP,c:/tmp,c:/temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,~/")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
	  where this is possible.  The directory must exist, Vim will not
	  create it for you.
	- Empty means that no backup file will be created ( 'patchmode' is
	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
	  as the edited file.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et al.) means to
	  put the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The
	  leading "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.
	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
<	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
	home directory for this to work properly.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'backupext'* *'bex'* *E589*
'backupext' 'bex'	string	(default "~", for VMS: "_")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
	".bak" that you want to keep.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
	autocommand to change 'backupext' just before writing the file to
	include a timestamp. >
		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = '-' . strftime("%Y%b%d%X") . '~'
<	Use 'backupdir' to put the backup in a different directory.

						*'backupskip'* *'bsk'*
'backupskip' 'bsk'	string	(default: "/tmp/*,$TMPDIR/*,$TMP/*,$TEMP/*")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.

	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
	backups if you don't care about losing the file.

	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
		:let backupskip = escape(expand('$HOME'), '\') . '/tmp/*'

<	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
	the newly created file).  Also see 'backupcopy' and |crontab|.

						*'balloondelay'* *'bdlay'*
'balloondelay' 'bdlay'	number	(default: 600)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Delay in milliseconds before a balloon may pop up.  See |balloon-eval|.

		       *'ballooneval'* *'beval'* *'noballooneval'* *'nobeval'*
'ballooneval' 'beval'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Switch on the |balloon-eval| functionality.

						     *'balloonexpr'* *'bexpr'*
'balloonexpr' 'bexpr'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Expression for text to show in evaluation balloon.  It is only used
	when 'ballooneval' is on.  These variables can be used:

	v:beval_bufnr	number of the buffer in which balloon is going to show
	v:beval_winnr	number of the window
	v:beval_lnum	line number
	v:beval_col	column number (byte index)
	v:beval_text	word under or after the mouse pointer

	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!
	Example: >
    function! MyBalloonExpr()
	return 'Cursor is at line ' . v:beval_lnum .
		\', column ' . v:beval_col .
		\ ' of file ' .  bufname(v:beval_bufnr) .
		\ ' on word "' . v:beval_text . '"'
    endfunction
    set bexpr=MyBalloonExpr()
    set ballooneval
<
	NOTE: The balloon is displayed only if the cursor is on a text
	character.  If the result of evaluating 'balloonexpr' is not empty,
	Vim does not try to send a message to an external debugger (Netbeans
	or Sun Workshop).

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'balloonexpr' |textlock|.

	To check whether line breaks in the balloon text work use this check: >
		if has("balloon_multiline")
<	When they are supported "\n" characters will start a new line.  If the
	expression evaluates to a |List| this is equal to using each List item
	as a string and putting "\n" in between them.

				     *'binary'* *'bin'* *'nobinary'* *'nobin'*
'binary' 'bin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
		'textwidth'  will be set to 0
		'wrapmargin' will be set to 0
		'modeline'   will be off
		'expandtab'  will be off
	Also, 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options will not be used, the
	file is read and written like 'fileformat' was "unix" (a single <NL>
	separates lines).
	The 'fileencoding' and 'fileencodings' options will not be used, the
	file is read without conversion.
	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is
	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
	'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
	'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
	'bin' is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
	saved option values.
	To edit a file with 'binary' set you can use the |++bin| argument.
	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
	files you edit.
	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
	the 'endofline' option.

			*'bioskey'* *'biosk'* *'nobioskey'* *'nobiosk'*
'bioskey' 'biosk'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only for MS-DOS}
	When on the BIOS is called to obtain a keyboard character.  This works
	better to detect CTRL-C, but only works for the console.  When using a
	terminal over a serial port reset this option.
	Also see |'conskey'|.

							*'bomb'* *'nobomb'*
'bomb'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
	- this option is on
	- the 'binary' option is off
	- 'fileencoding' is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
	  endian variants.
	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
	appear halfway the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
	When Vim reads a file and 'fileencodings' starts with "ucs-bom", a
	check for the presence of the BOM is done and 'bomb' set accordingly.
	Unless 'binary' is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
	will be restored when writing the file.

						*'breakat'* *'brk'*
'breakat' 'brk'		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
	break if 'linebreak' is on.  Only works for ASCII and also for 8-bit
	characters when 'encoding' is an 8-bit encoding.

						*'breakindent'* *'bri'*
'breakindent' 'bri'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
	of text.

						*'breakindentopt'* *'briopt'*
'breakindentopt' 'briopt' string (default empty)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Settings for 'breakindent'. It can consist of the following optional
	items and must be separated by a comma:
		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
			    applying 'breakindent', even if the resulting
			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
			    text indented almost to the right window border
			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
		shift:{n}   After applying 'breakindent', the wrapped line's
			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
			    continuation (positive).
		sbr	    Display the 'showbreak' value before applying the 
			    additional indent.
	The default value for min is 20 and shift is 0.

						*'browsedir'* *'bsdir'*
'browsedir' 'bsdir'	string	(default: "last")
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for Motif, Athena, GTK, Mac and
			Win32 GUI}
	Which directory to use for the file browser:
	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
			file was opened or saved.
	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
	   current	Use the current directory.
	   {path}	Use the specified directory

						*'bufhidden'* *'bh'*
'bufhidden' 'bh'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
	displayed in a window:
	  <empty>	follow the global 'hidden' option
	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), also when 'hidden'
			is not set
	  unload	unload the buffer, also when 'hidden' is set or using
			|:hide|
	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bdelete|
	  wipe		wipe out the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bwipeout|

	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
	that switch between buffers temporarily.
	This option is used together with 'buftype' and 'swapfile' to specify
	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

			*'buflisted'* *'bl'* *'nobuflisted'* *'nobl'* *E85*
'buflisted' 'bl'	boolean (default: on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

						*'buftype'* *'bt'* *E382*
'buftype' 'bt'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
	  <empty>	normal buffer
	  nofile	buffer which is not related to a file and will not be
			written
	  nowrite	buffer which will not be written
	  acwrite	buffer which will always be written with BufWriteCmd
			autocommands. {not available when compiled without the
			|+autocmd| feature}
	  quickfix	quickfix buffer, contains list of errors |:cwindow|
			or list of locations |:lwindow|
	  help		help buffer (you are not supposed to set this
			manually)

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'swapfile' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!

	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
	you are not supposed to change it.

	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
			work (":w filename" does work though).
	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |'modified'|.
			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
			example when you quit Vim.
	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
			(when 'swapfile' has been reset there is never a swap
			file).
	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
			command.
							*E676*
	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

						*'casemap'* *'cmp'*
'casemap' 'cmp'		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
	these words, separated by a comma:
	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
			locale does not change the case mapping.  This only
			matters when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding,
			"latin1" or "iso-8859-15".  When "internal" is
			omitted, the towupper() and towlower() system library
			functions are used when available.
	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
			This probably only matters for Turkish.

						*'cdpath'* *'cd'* *E344* *E346*
'cdpath' 'cd'		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|:cd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being searched
	for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with "/", "./"
	or "../", the 'cdpath' option is not used then.
	The 'cdpath' option's value has the same form and semantics as
	|'path'|.  Also see |file-searching|.
	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
	in the current directory first.
	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
	override it: >
	  :let &cdpath = ',' . substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', '\\\0', 'g'), ':', ',', 'g')
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	(parts of 'cdpath' can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

						*'cedit'*
'cedit'			string	(Vi default: "", Vim default: CTRL-F)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	The key used in Command-line Mode to open the command-line window.
	The default is CTRL-F when 'compatible' is off.
	Only non-printable keys are allowed.
	The key can be specified as a single character, but it is difficult to
	type.  The preferred way is to use the <> notation.  Examples: >
		:set cedit=<C-Y>
		:set cedit=<Esc>
<	|Nvi| also has this option, but it only uses the first character.
	See |cmdwin|.

				*'charconvert'* *'ccv'* *E202* *E214* *E513*
'charconvert' 'ccv'	string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			and |+eval| features}
			{not in Vi}
	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
	different encoding from what is desired.
	'charconvert' is not used when the internal iconv() function is
	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
	preferred, because it is much faster.
	'charconvert' is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
	The expression must return zero or an empty string for success,
	non-zero for failure.
	The possible encoding names encountered are in 'encoding'.
	Additionally, names given in 'fileencodings' and 'fileencoding' are
	used.
	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
	is done internally by Vim, 'charconvert' is not used for this.
	'charconvert' is also used to convert the viminfo file, if the 'c'
	flag is present in 'viminfo'.  Also used for Unicode conversion.
	Example: >
		set charconvert=CharConvert()
		fun CharConvert()
		  system("recode "
			\ . v:charconvert_from . ".." . v:charconvert_to
			\ . " <" . v:fname_in . " >" v:fname_out)
		  return v:shell_error
		endfun
<	The related Vim variables are:
		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
		v:fname_in		name of the input file
		v:fname_out		name of the output file
	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
	Note that v:charconvert_from and v:charconvert_to may be different
	from 'encoding'.  Vim internally uses UTF-8 instead of UCS-2 or UCS-4.
	Encryption is not done by Vim when using 'charconvert'.  If you want
	to encrypt the file after conversion, 'charconvert' should take care
	of this.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				   *'cindent'* *'cin'* *'nocindent'* *'nocin'*
'cindent' 'cin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See 'cinkeys' to set the keys
	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and 'cinoptions' to set your
	preferred indent style.
	If 'indentexpr' is not empty, it overrules 'cindent'.
	If 'lisp' is not on and both 'indentexpr' and 'equalprg' are empty,
	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
	external program.
	See |C-indenting|.
	When you don't like the way 'cindent' works, try the 'smartindent'
	option or 'indentexpr'.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

							*'cinkeys'* *'cink'*
'cinkeys' 'cink'	string	(default "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only used if 'cindent' is on and 'indentexpr' is
	empty.
	For the format of this option see |cinkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting|.

						*'cinoptions'* *'cino'*
'cinoptions' 'cino'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	The 'cinoptions' affect the way 'cindent' reindents lines in a C
	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.


						*'cinwords'* *'cinw'*
'cinwords' 'cinw'	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without both the
			|+cindent| and the |+smartindent| features}
	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
	'smartindent' or 'cindent' is set.  For 'cindent' this is only done at
	an appropriate place (inside {}).
	Note that 'ignorecase' isn't used for 'cinwords'.  If case doesn't
	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
	"if,If,IF".

						*'clipboard'* *'cb'*
'clipboard' 'cb'	string	(default "autoselect,exclude:cons\|linux"
						  for X-windows, "" otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in GUI versions or when the |+xterm_clipboard|
			feature is included}
	This option is a list of comma separated names.
	These names are recognized:

						*clipboard-unnamed*
	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register '*'
			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in 'clipboard'
			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
			|gui-clipboard|.

						*clipboard-unnamedplus*
	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
			clipboard register '+' (|quoteplus|) instead of
			register '*' for all yank, delete, change and put
			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
			option, yank operations (but not delete, change or
			put) will additionally copy the text into register
			'*'.
			Only available with the |+X11| feature.
			Availability can be checked with: >
				if has('unnamedplus')
<
						*clipboard-autoselect*
	autoselect	Works like the 'a' flag in 'guioptions': If present,
			then whenever Visual mode is started, or the Visual
			area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of the
			windowing system's global selection or put the
			selected text on the clipboard used by the selection
			register "*.  See |guioptions_a| and |quotestar| for
			details.  When the GUI is active, the 'a' flag in
			'guioptions' is used, when the GUI is not active, this
			"autoselect" flag is used.
			Also applies to the modeless selection.

						*clipboard-autoselectplus*
	autoselectplus  Like "autoselect" but using the + register instead of
			the * register.  Compare to the 'P' flag in
			'guioptions'.

						*clipboard-autoselectml*
	autoselectml	Like "autoselect", but for the modeless selection
			only.  Compare to the 'A' flag in 'guioptions'.

						*clipboard-html*
	html		When the clipboard contains HTML, use this when
			pasting.  When putting text on the clipboard, mark it
			as HTML.  This works to copy rendered HTML from
			Firefox, paste it as raw HTML in Vim, select the HTML
			in Vim and paste it in a rich edit box in Firefox.
			You probably want to add this only temporarily,
			possibly use BufEnter autocommands.
			Only supported for GTK version 2 and later.
			Only available with the |+multi_byte| feature.

						*clipboard-exclude*
	exclude:{pattern}
			Defines a pattern that is matched against the name of
			the terminal 'term'.  If there is a match, no
			connection will be made to the X server.  This is
			useful in this situation:
			- Running Vim in a console.
			- $DISPLAY is set to start applications on another
			  display.
			- You do not want to connect to the X server in the
			  console, but do want this in a terminal emulator.
			To never connect to the X server use: >
				exclude:.*
<			This has the same effect as using the |-X| argument.
			Note that when there is no connection to the X server
			the window title won't be restored and the clipboard
			cannot be accessed.
			The value of 'magic' is ignored, {pattern} is
			interpreted as if 'magic' was on.
			The rest of the option value will be used for
			{pattern}, this must be the last entry.

						*'cmdheight'* *'ch'*
'cmdheight' 'ch'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
	|hit-enter| prompts.
	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
	page can have a different value.

						*'cmdwinheight'* *'cwh'*
'cmdwinheight' 'cwh'	number	(default 7)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line window. |cmdwin|

						*'colorcolumn'* *'cc'*
'colorcolumn' 'cc'	string	(default "")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	'colorcolumn' is a comma separated list of screen columns that are
	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
	'+' or '-', which is added to or subtracted from 'textwidth'. >

		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after 'textwidth'
		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after 'textwidth'
		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
<
	When 'textwidth' is zero then the items with '-' and '+' are not used.
	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

						*'columns'* *'co'* *E594*
'columns' 'co'		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.  Also see
	|posix-screen-size|.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest
	window possible: >
		:set columns=9999
<	Minimum value is 12, maximum value is 10000.

					*'comments'* *'com'* *E524* *E525*
'comments' 'com'	string	(default
				"s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+comments|
			feature}
	A comma separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
	insert a space.

					*'commentstring'* *'cms'* *E537*
'commentstring' 'cms'	string	(default "/*%s*/")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
	|fold-marker|.

			*'compatible'* *'cp'* *'nocompatible'* *'nocp'*
'compatible' 'cp'	boolean	(default on, off when a |vimrc| or |gvimrc|
								file is found)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the effect of making Vim either more Vi-compatible, or
	make Vim behave in a more useful way.
	This is a special kind of option, because when it's set or reset,
	other options are also changed as a side effect.  CAREFUL: Setting or
	resetting this option can have a lot of unexpected effects: Mappings
	are interpreted in another way, undo behaves differently, etc.  If you
	set this option in your vimrc file, you should probably put it at the
	very start.
	By default this option is on and the Vi defaults are used for the
	options.  This default was chosen for those people who want to use Vim
	just like Vi, and don't even (want to) know about the 'compatible'
	option.
	When a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file is found while Vim is starting up,
	this option is switched off, and all options that have not been
	modified will be set to the Vim defaults.  Effectively, this means
	that when a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file exists, Vim will use the Vim
	defaults, otherwise it will use the Vi defaults.  (Note: This doesn't
	happen for the system-wide vimrc or gvimrc file, nor for a file given
	with the |-u| argument).  Also see |compatible-default| and
	|posix-compliance|.
	You can also set this option with the "-C" argument, and reset it with
	"-N".  See |-C| and |-N|.
	Switching this option off makes the Vim defaults be used for options
	that have a different Vi and Vim default value.  See the options
	marked with a '+' below.  Other options are not modified.
	At the moment this option is set, several other options will be set
	or reset to make Vim as Vi-compatible as possible.  See the table
	below.  This can be used if you want to revert to Vi compatible
	editing.
	See also 'cpoptions'.

	option		+ set value	effect	~

	'allowrevins'	  off		no CTRL-_ command

						*'complete'* *'cpt'* *E535*
'complete' 'cpt'	string	(default: ".,w,b,u,t,i")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
	and the places to scan.  It is a comma separated list of flags:
	.	scan the current buffer ( 'wrapscan' is ignored)
	w	scan buffers from other windows
	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
	k	scan the files given with the 'dictionary' option
	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
<	s	scan the files given with the 'thesaurus' option
	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
		are valid too.
	i	scan current and included files
	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
	]	tag completion
	t	same as "]"

	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
	whole-line completion.

	The default is ".,w,b,u,t,i", which means to scan:
	   1. the current buffer
	   2. buffers in other windows
	   3. other loaded buffers
	   4. unloaded buffers
	   5. tags
	   6. included files

	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any 'iskeyword'-
	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

						*'completefunc'* *'cfu'*
'completefunc' 'cfu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'completeopt'* *'cot'*
'completeopt' 'cot'	string	(default: "menu,preview")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
			{not in Vi}
	A comma separated list of options for Insert mode completion
	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:

	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|

	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
		    Useful when there is additional information about the
		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.

	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
		    of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is
		    used.

	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".


						*'concealcursor'* *'cocu'*
'concealcursor' 'cocu'	string (default: "")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+conceal|
			feature}
	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
	other lines.
	  n		Normal mode
	  v		Visual mode
	  i		Insert mode
	  c		Command line editing, for 'incsearch'

	'v' applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
	you can see what you are doing.
	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.


'conceallevel' 'cole'		*'conceallevel'* *'cole'*
			number (default 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+conceal|
			feature}
	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
	is shown:

	Value		Effect ~
	0		Text is shown normally
	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
			character defined in 'listchars' is used (default is a
			space).
			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
			custom replacement character defined (see
			|:syn-cchar|).
	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.

	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the 'concealcursor'
	option.

				*'confirm'* *'cf'* *'noconfirm'* *'nocf'*
'confirm' 'cf'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When 'confirm' is on, certain operations that would normally
	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
	instead raise a |dialog| asking if you wish to save the current
	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
	If 'confirm' is off you can still activate confirmation for one
	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
	command.
	Also see the |confirm()| function and the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.

			*'conskey'* *'consk'* *'noconskey'* *'noconsk'*
'conskey' 'consk'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only for MS-DOS}
	When on direct console I/O is used to obtain a keyboard character.
	This should work in most cases.  Also see |'bioskey'|.  Together,
	three methods of console input are available:
	'conskey'   'bioskey'	    action ~
	   on	     on or off	    direct console input
	   off		on	    BIOS
	   off		off	    STDIN

			*'copyindent'* *'ci'* *'nocopyindent'* *'noci'*
'copyindent' 'ci'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is enabled,
	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
	existing line.  'expandtab' has no effect on these characters, a Tab
	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
	NOTE: 'copyindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.
	Also see 'preserveindent'.

						*'cpoptions'* *'cpo'*
'cpoptions' 'cpo'	string	(Vim default: "aABceFs",
				 Vi default:  all flags)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
	'cpoptions' stands for "compatible-options".
	Commas can be added for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.
	NOTE: This option is set to the POSIX default value at startup when
	the Vi default value would be used and the $VIM_POSIX environment
	variable exists |posix|.  This means Vim tries to behave like the
	POSIX specification.

	    contains	behavior	~
								*cpo-a*
		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-A*
		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-b*
		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
			the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
			the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
			include the '|' in the mapping.  Applies to all
			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
			See also |map_bar|.
								*cpo-B*
		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
			abbreviations and the "to" part of the menu commands.
			Remove this flag to be able to use a backslash like a
			CTRL-V.  For example, the command ":map X \<Esc>"
			results in X being mapped to:
				'B' included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
				'B' excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
				('<' excluded in both cases)
								*cpo-c*
		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
			next line.  When not present searching continues
			one character from the cursor position.  With 'c'
			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
			"/abab", without 'c' there are five matches.
								*cpo-C*
		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
								*cpo-d*
		d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
			tags file in the current directory.
								*cpo-D*
		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
			|t|.
								*cpo-e*
		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
								*cpo-E*
		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
			at least one character is to be operate on.  Example:
			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
								*cpo-f*
		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
								*cpo-F*
		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current
			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
								*cpo-g*
		g	Goto line 1 when using ":edit" without argument.
								*cpo-H*
		H	When using "I" on a line with only blanks, insert
			before the last blank.  Without this flag insert after
			the last blank.
								*cpo-i*
		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
			leave it modified.
								*cpo-I*
		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
			indent for 'autoindent', do not delete the indent.
								*cpo-j*
		j	When joining lines, only add two spaces after a '.',
			not after '!' or '?'.  Also see 'joinspaces'.
								*cpo-J*
		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
			the '.', '!' or '?'.  A <Tab> is not recognized as
			white space.
								*cpo-k*
		k	Disable the recognition of raw key codes in
			mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of menu
			commands.  For example, if <Key> sends ^[OA (where ^[
			is <Esc>), the command ":map X ^[OA" results in X
			being mapped to:
				'k' included:	"^[OA"	 (3 characters)
				'k' excluded:	"<Key>"  (one key code)
			Also see the '<' flag below.
								*cpo-K*
		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
			halfway a mapping.  This breaks mapping <F1><F1> when
			only part of the second <F1> has been read.  It
			enables cancelling the mapping by typing <F1><Esc>.
								*cpo-l*
		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
			See |/[]|
			   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
			   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
			Also see |cpo-\|.
								*cpo-L*
		L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin',
			'textwidth', 'softtabstop' and Virtual Replace mode
			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
								*cpo-m*
		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
			a second or until a character is typed.  |'showmatch'|
								*cpo-M*
		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
								*cpo-n*
		n	When included, the column used for 'number' and
			'relativenumber' will also be used for text of wrapped
			lines.
								*cpo-o*
		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
			next search.
								*cpo-O*
		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
								*cpo-p*
		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
			slightly better algorithm is used.
								*cpo-P*
		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
			the 'F' flag is also included |cpo-F|.
								*cpo-q*
		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
			position where it would be when joining two lines.
								*cpo-r*
		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
			command, instead of the actually used search string.
								*cpo-R*
		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
								*cpo-s*
		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
			set when the buffer is created.
								*cpo-S*
		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
			(except 'readonly', 'fileformat', 'filetype' and
			'syntax').  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
			The options are set to the values in the current
			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
			buffer options global to all buffers.

			's'    'S'     copy buffer options
			no     no      when buffer created
			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
								*cpo-t*
		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
			last used search pattern.
								*cpo-u*
		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
								*cpo-v*
		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
			characters.
								*cpo-w*
		w	When using "cw" on a blank character, only change one
			character and not all blanks until the start of the
			next word.
								*cpo-W*
		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
								*cpo-x*
		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
								*cpo-X*
		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
			and a count.
								*cpo-y*
		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".
								*cpo-Z*
		Z	When using "w!" while the 'readonly' option is set,
			don't reset 'readonly'.
								*cpo-!*
		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
			used -filter- command is used.
								*cpo-$*
		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
			line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
			point.
								*cpo-%*
		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
			This flag is also used for other features, such as
			C-indenting.
								*cpo--*
		-	When included, a vertical movement command fails when
			it would go above the first line or below the last
			line.  Without it the cursor moves to the first or
			last line, unless it already was in that line.
			Applies to the commands "-", "k", CTRL-P, "+", "j",
			CTRL-N, CTRL-J and ":1234".
								*cpo-+*
		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
			'modified' flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
			itself may still be different from its file.
								*cpo-star*
		*	Use ":*" in the same way as ":@".  When not included,
			":*" is an alias for ":'<,'>", select the Visual area.
								*cpo-<*
		<	Disable the recognition of special key codes in |<>|
			form in mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of
			menu commands.  For example, the command
			":map X <Tab>" results in X being mapped to:
				'<' included:	"<Tab>"  (5 characters)
				'<' excluded:	"^I"	 (^I is a real <Tab>)
			Also see the 'k' flag above.
								*cpo->*
		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
			the appended text.
								*cpo-;*
		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
			following occurrence.

	POSIX flags.  These are not included in the Vi default value, except
	when $VIM_POSIX was set on startup. |posix|

	    contains	behavior	~
								*cpo-#*
		#	A count before "D", "o" and "O" has no effect.
								*cpo-&*
		&	When ":preserve" was used keep the swap file when
			exiting normally while this buffer is still loaded.
			This flag is tested when exiting.
								*cpo-\*
		\	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]" is special  See |/[]|
			   '\' included: "/[ \-]"  finds <Space>, '\' and '-'
			   '\' excluded: "/[ \-]"  finds <Space> and '-'
			Also see |cpo-l|.
								*cpo-/*
		/	When "%" is used as the replacement string in a |:s|
			command, use the previous replacement string. |:s%|
								*cpo-{*
		{	The |{| and |}| commands also stop at a "{" character
			at the start of a line.
								*cpo-.*
		.	The ":chdir" and ":cd" commands fail if the current
			buffer is modified, unless ! is used.  Vim doesn't
			need this, since it remembers the full path of an
			opened file.
								*cpo-bar*
		|	The value of the $LINES and $COLUMNS environment
			variables overrule the terminal size values obtained
			with system specific functions.


						*'cryptmethod'* *'cm'*
'cryptmethod'		string	(default "zip")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Method used for encryption when the buffer is written to a file:
							*pkzip*
	   zip		PkZip compatible method.  A weak kind of encryption.
			Backwards compatible with Vim 7.2 and older.
							*blowfish*
	   blowfish	Blowfish method.  Medium strong encryption but it has
			an implementation flaw.  Requires Vim 7.3 or later,
			files can NOT be read by Vim 7.2 and older.  This adds
			a "seed" to the file, every time you write the file
			the encrypted bytes will be different.
							*blowfish2*
	   blowfish2	Blowfish method.  Medium strong encryption.  Requires
			Vim 7.4.399 or later, files can NOT be read by Vim 7.3
			and older.  This adds a "seed" to the file, every time
			you write the file the encrypted bytes will be
			different.  The whole undo file is encrypted, not just
			the pieces of text.

	When reading an encrypted file 'cryptmethod' will be set automatically
	to the detected method of the file being read.  Thus if you write it
	without changing 'cryptmethod' the same method will be used.
	Changing 'cryptmethod' does not mark the file as modified, you have to
	explicitly write it, you don't get a warning unless there are other
	modifications.  Also see |:X|.

	When setting the global value to an empty string, it will end up with
	the value "zip".  When setting the local value to an empty string the
	buffer will use the global value.

	When a new encryption method is added in a later version of Vim, and
	the current version does not recognize it, you will get	*E821* .
	You need to edit this file with the later version of Vim.


						*'cscopepathcomp'* *'cspc'*
'cscopepathcomp' 'cspc'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines how many components of the path to show in a list of tags.
	See |cscopepathcomp|.

						*'cscopeprg'* *'csprg'*
'cscopeprg' 'csprg'	string	(default "cscope")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies the command to execute cscope.  See |cscopeprg|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'cscopequickfix'* *'csqf'*
'cscopequickfix' 'csqf' string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			or |+quickfix| features}
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope results.
	See |cscopequickfix|.

		*'cscoperelative'* *'csre'* *'nocscoperelative'* *'nocsre'*
'cscoperelative' 'csre' boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	In the absence of a prefix (-P) for cscope. setting this option enables
	to use the basename of cscope.out path as the prefix.
	See |cscoperelative|.

				*'cscopetag'* *'cst'* *'nocscopetag'* *'nocst'*
'cscopetag' 'cst'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Use cscope for tag commands.  See |cscope-options|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'cscopetagorder'* *'csto'*
'cscopetagorder' 'csto'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines the order in which ":cstag" performs a search.  See
	|cscopetagorder|.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

					*'cscopeverbose'* *'csverb'*
					*'nocscopeverbose'* *'nocsverb'*
'cscopeverbose' 'csverb' boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Give messages when adding a cscope database.  See |cscopeverbose|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			*'cursorbind'* *'crb'* *'nocursorbind'* *'nocrb'*
'cursorbind' 'crb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cursorbind|
			feature}
	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file (see 'diff'); in diff mode,
	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
	taken into account.


			*'cursorcolumn'* *'cuc'* *'nocursorcolumn'* *'nocuc'*
'cursorcolumn' 'cuc'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen column of the cursor with CursorColumn
	|hl-CursorColumn|.  Useful to align text.  Will make screen redrawing
	slower.
	If you only want the highlighting in the current window you can use
	these autocommands: >
		au WinLeave * set nocursorline nocursorcolumn
		au WinEnter * set cursorline cursorcolumn
<

			*'cursorline'* *'cul'* *'nocursorline'* *'nocul'*
'cursorline' 'cul'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen line of the cursor with CursorLine
	|hl-CursorLine|.  Useful to easily spot the cursor.  Will make screen
	redrawing slower.
	When Visual mode is active the highlighting isn't used to make it
	easier to see the selected text.


						*'debug'*
'debug'			string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	These values can be used:
	msg	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway.
	throw	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway and also throw an exception and set |v:errmsg|.
	beep	A message will be given when otherwise only a beep would be
		produced.
	The values can be combined, separated by a comma.
	"msg" and "throw" are useful for debugging 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr' or
	'indentexpr'.

						*'define'* *'def'*
'define' 'def'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*define")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The 'isident' option is
	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
		{match with 'define'}{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
	or backslash.
	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
	useful, to include const type declarations: >
		^\(#\s*define\|[a-z]*\s*const\s*[a-z]*\)
<	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!

			*'delcombine'* *'deco'* *'nodelcombine'* *'nodeco'*
'delcombine' 'deco'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	If editing Unicode and this option is set, backspace and Normal mode
	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
	default) the character along with its combining characters are
	deleted.
	Note: When 'delcombine' is set "xx" may work different from "2x"!

	This is useful for Arabic, Hebrew and many other languages where one
	may have combining characters overtop of base characters, and want
	to remove only the combining ones.

						*'dictionary'* *'dict'*
'dictionary' 'dict'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
	When this option is empty, or an entry "spell" is present, spell
	checking is enabled the currently active spelling is used. |spell|
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
	Where to find a list of words?
	- On FreeBSD, there is the file "/usr/share/dict/words".
	- In the Simtel archive, look in the "msdos/linguist" directory.
	- In "miscfiles" of the GNU collection.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

							*'diff'* *'nodiff'*
'diff'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Join the current window in the group of windows that shows differences
	between files.  See |vimdiff|.

						*'dex'* *'diffexpr'*
'diffexpr' 'dex'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain an ed-style diff file from two
	versions of a file.  See |diff-diffexpr|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'dip'* *'diffopt'*
'diffopt' 'dip'		string	(default "filler")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.

		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
				synchronized with a window that has inserted
				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
				when windows are side-by-side and 'scrollbind'
				is set.

		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
				See |fold-diff|.

		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
				to the "diff" command if 'diffexpr' is empty.

		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
				'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
				of the "diff" command for what this does
				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
				white space, but not leading white space.

		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the 'foldcolumn' option to {n} when
				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.

	Examples: >

		:set diffopt=filler,context:4
		:set diffopt=
		:set diffopt=filler,foldcolumn:3
<
				     *'digraph'* *'dg'* *'nodigraph'* *'nodg'*
'digraph' 'dg'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+digraphs|
			feature}
	Enable the entering of digraphs in Insert mode with {char1} <BS>
	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'directory'* *'dir'*
'directory' 'dir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,$TEMP,c:\tmp,c:\temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,/var/tmp,/tmp")
			global
	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
	  possible.
	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
	  impossible!).
	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et al.) means to
	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//"
	  or "\\", the swap file name will be built from the complete path to
	  the file with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs.
	  This will ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
	  On Win32, when a separating comma is following, you must use "//",
	  since "\\" will include the comma in the file name.
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
	home directory is tried first.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	{Vi: directory to put temp file in, defaults to "/tmp"}

					*'display'* *'dy'*
'display' 'dy'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Change the way text is displayed.  This is comma separated list of
	flags:
	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
			in a window will be displayed.  When not included, a
			last line that doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.
	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
			instead of using ^C and ~C.

						*'eadirection'* *'ead'*
'eadirection' 'ead'	string	(default "both")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Tells when the 'equalalways' option applies:
		ver	vertically, width of windows is not affected
		hor	horizontally, height of windows is not affected
		both	width and height of windows is affected

			   *'ed'* *'edcompatible'* *'noed'* *'noedcompatible'*
'edcompatible' 'ed'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Makes the 'g' and 'c' flags of the ":substitute" command to be
	toggled each time the flag is given.  See |complex-change|.  See
	also 'gdefault' option.
	Switching this option on is discouraged!

					*'encoding'* *'enc'* *E543*
'encoding' 'enc'	string (default: "latin1" or value from $LANG)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the character encoding used inside Vim.  It applies to text in
	the buffers, registers, Strings in expressions, text stored in the
	viminfo file, etc.  It sets the kind of characters which Vim can work
	with.  See |encoding-names| for the possible values.

	NOTE: Changing this option will not change the encoding of the
	existing text in Vim.  It may cause non-ASCII text to become invalid.
	It should normally be kept at its default value, or set when Vim
	starts up.  See |multibyte|.  To reload the menus see |:menutrans|.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline|.  It would most likely
	corrupt the text.

	NOTE: For GTK+ 2 it is highly recommended to set 'encoding' to
	"utf-8".  Although care has been taken to allow different values of
	'encoding', "utf-8" is the natural choice for the environment and
	avoids unnecessary conversion overhead.  "utf-8" has not been made
	the default to prevent different behavior of the GUI and terminal
	versions, and to avoid changing the encoding of newly created files
	without your knowledge (in case 'fileencodings' is empty).

	The character encoding of files can be different from 'encoding'.
	This is specified with 'fileencoding'.  The conversion is done with
	iconv() or as specified with 'charconvert'.

	If you need to know whether 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding, you
	can use: >
		if has("multi_byte_encoding")
<
	Normally 'encoding' will be equal to your current locale.  This will
	be the default if Vim recognizes your environment settings.  If
	'encoding' is not set to the current locale, 'termencoding' must be
	set to convert typed and displayed text.  See |encoding-table|.

	When you set this option, it fires the |EncodingChanged| autocommand
	event so that you can set up fonts if necessary.

	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
	you can set it with uppercase values too.  Underscores are translated
	to '-' signs.
	When the encoding is recognized, it is changed to the standard name.
	For example "Latin-1" becomes "latin1", "ISO_88592" becomes
	"iso-8859-2" and "utf8" becomes "utf-8".

	Note: "latin1" is also used when the encoding could not be detected.
	This only works when editing files in the same encoding!  When the
	actual character set is not latin1, make sure 'fileencoding' and
	'fileencodings' are empty.  When conversion is needed, switch to using
	utf-8.

	When "unicode", "ucs-2" or "ucs-4" is used, Vim internally uses utf-8.
	You don't notice this while editing, but it does matter for the
	|viminfo-file|.  And Vim expects the terminal to use utf-8 too.  Thus
	setting 'encoding' to one of these values instead of utf-8 only has
	effect for encoding used for files when 'fileencoding' is empty.

	When 'encoding' is set to a Unicode encoding, and 'fileencodings' was
	not set yet, the default for 'fileencodings' is changed.

			*'endofline'* *'eol'* *'noendofline'* *'noeol'*
'endofline' 'eol'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and this option is off and the 'binary' option
	is on, no <EOL> will be written for the last line in the file.  This
	option is automatically set when starting to edit a new file, unless
	the file does not have an <EOL> for the last line in the file, in
	which case it is reset.  Normally you don't have to set or reset this
	option.  When 'binary' is off the value is not used when writing the
	file.  When 'binary' is on it is used to remember the presence of a
	<EOL> for the last line in the file, so that when you write the file
	the situation from the original file can be kept.  But you can change
	it if you want to.

			     *'equalalways'* *'ea'* *'noequalalways'* *'noea'*
'equalalways' 'ea'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
	(depending on 'splitbelow' and 'splitright').
	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
	'eadirection' option tells in which direction the size is affected.
	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
	'winfixheight' and 'winfixwidth', respectively.
	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are
	currently not equalized (it's complicated, but may be implemented in
	the future).

						*'equalprg'* *'ep'*
'equalprg' 'ep'		string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	External program to use for "=" command.  When this option is empty
	the internal formatting functions are used; either 'lisp', 'cindent'
	or 'indentexpr'.  When Vim was compiled without internal formatting,
	the "indent" program is used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'errorbells'* *'eb'* *'noerrorbells'* *'noeb'*
'errorbells' 'eb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ring the bell (beep or screen flash) for error messages.  This only
	makes a difference for error messages, the bell will be used always
	for a lot of errors without a message (e.g., hitting <Esc> in Normal
	mode).  See 'visualbell' on how to make the bell behave like a beep,
	screen flash or do nothing.

						*'errorfile'* *'ef'*
'errorfile' 'ef'	string	(Amiga default: "AztecC.Err",
					others: "errors.err")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the QuickFix mode (see |:cf|).
	When the "-q" command-line argument is used, 'errorfile' is set to the
	following argument.  See |-q|.
	NOT used for the ":make" command.  See 'makeef' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'errorformat'* *'efm'*
'errorformat' 'efm'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Scanf-like description of the format for the lines in the error file
	(see |errorformat|).

				     *'esckeys'* *'ek'* *'noesckeys'* *'noek'*
'esckeys' 'ek'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Function keys that start with an <Esc> are recognized in Insert
	mode.  When this option is off, the cursor and function keys cannot be
	used in Insert mode if they start with an <Esc>.  The advantage of
	this is that the single <Esc> is recognized immediately, instead of
	after one second.  Instead of resetting this option, you might want to
	try changing the values for 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen'.  Note that
	when 'esckeys' is off, you can still map anything, but the cursor keys
	won't work by default.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'eventignore'* *'ei'*
'eventignore' 'ei'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+autocmd|
			feature}
	A list of autocommand event names, which are to be ignored.
	When set to "all" or when "all" is one of the items, all autocommand
	events are ignored, autocommands will not be executed.
	Otherwise this is a comma separated list of event names.  Example: >
	    :set ei=WinEnter,WinLeave
<
				 *'expandtab'* *'et'* *'noexpandtab'* *'noet'*
'expandtab' 'et'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	In Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a
	<Tab>.  Spaces are used in indents with the '>' and '<' commands and
	when 'autoindent' is on.  To insert a real tab when 'expandtab' is
	on, use CTRL-V<Tab>.  See also |:retab| and |ins-expandtab|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

					*'exrc'* *'ex'* *'noexrc'* *'noex'*
'exrc' 'ex'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enables the reading of .vimrc, .exrc and .gvimrc in the current
	directory.  If you switch this option on you should also consider
	setting the 'secure' option (see |initialization|).  Using a local
	.exrc, .vimrc or .gvimrc is a potential security leak, use with care!
	also see |.vimrc| and |gui-init|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				*'fileencoding'* *'fenc'* *E213*
'fileencoding' 'fenc'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the character encoding for the file of this buffer.

	When 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding', conversion will be
	done when writing the file.  For reading see below.
	When 'fileencoding' is empty, the same value as 'encoding' will be
	used (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
	Conversion will also be done when 'encoding' and 'fileencoding' are
	both a Unicode encoding and 'fileencoding' is not utf-8.  That's
	because internally Unicode is always stored as utf-8.
		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information!  When
		'encoding' is "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding, conversion
		is most likely done in a way that the reverse conversion
		results in the same text.  When 'encoding' is not "utf-8" some
		characters may be lost!

	See 'encoding' for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
	|mbyte-conversion|.

	When reading a file 'fileencoding' will be set from 'fileencodings'.
	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
	'fileencoding', use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
	'fileencodings' is empty the value of 'fileencoding' is used.
	For a new file the global value of 'fileencoding' is used.

	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
	you can set it with uppercase values too.  '_' characters are
	replaced with '-'.  If a name is recognized from the list for
	'encoding', it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".

	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.

	Keep in mind that changing 'fenc' from a modeline happens
	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
	written.  If you do set 'fenc' in a modeline, you might want to set
	'nomodified' to avoid not being able to ":q".

	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.

							*'fe'*
	NOTE: Before version 6.0 this option specified the encoding for the
	whole of Vim, this was a mistake.  Now use 'encoding' instead.  The
	old short name was 'fe', which is no longer used.

					*'fileencodings'* *'fencs'*
'fileencodings' 'fencs'	string (default: "ucs-bom",
				    "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1" when
				    'encoding' is set to a Unicode value)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
	'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
	an empty string, which means the value of 'encoding' is used.
		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information!  When
		'encoding' is "utf-8" (or one of the other Unicode variants)
		conversion is most likely done in a way that the reverse
		conversion results in the same text.  When 'encoding' is not
		"utf-8" some non-ASCII characters may be lost!  You can use
		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
		that can't be converted.
	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
<	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
	non-blank characters.
	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
	not used.
	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
<	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
	an empty file.
	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
	accepted.
	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
	environment.  This is the default value for 'encoding'.  It is useful
	when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" and your environment uses a
	non-latin1 encoding, such as Russian.
	When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and a file contains an illegal byte
	sequence it won't be recognized as UTF-8.  You can use the |8g8|
	command to find the illegal byte sequence.
	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
					file
		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
	If 'fileencodings' is empty, 'fileencoding' is not modified.
	See 'fileencoding' for the possible values.
	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
	is read.

					*'fileformat'* *'ff'*
'fileformat' 'ff'	string (MS-DOS, MS-Windows, OS/2 default: "dos",
				Unix default: "unix",
				Macintosh default: "mac")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
	    dos	    <CR> <NL>
	    unix    <NL>
	    mac	    <CR>
	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
	For the character encoding of the file see 'fileencoding'.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformat' is ignored, file I/O
	works like it was set to "unix".
	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
	'fileformats' is not empty and 'binary' is off.
	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to "dos",
	'textmode' is set, otherwise 'textmode' is reset.

					*'fileformats'* *'ffs'*
'fileformats' 'ffs'	string (default:
				Vim+Vi	MS-DOS, MS-Windows OS/2: "dos,unix",
				Vim	Unix: "unix,dos",
				Vim	Mac: "mac,unix,dos",
				Vi	Cygwin: "unix,dos",
				Vi	others: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
	buffer:
	- When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
	  always.  It is not set automatically.
	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if 'fileformats'
	     includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
	     'fileformats' is used.
	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
	  file only, the option is not changed.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

	Note that when Vim starts up with an empty buffer this option is not
	used.  Set 'fileformat' in your .vimrc instead.

	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
	done:
	- When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
	  format will be used.
	- When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
	  used.
	Also see |file-formats|.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to an empty
	string or one format (no comma is included), 'textauto' is reset,
	otherwise 'textauto' is set.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

		*'fileignorecase'* *'fic'* *'nofileignorecase'* *'nofic'*
'fileignorecase' 'fic'	boolean	(default on for systems where case in file
				 names is normally ignored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set case is ignored when using file names and directories.
	See 'wildignorecase' for only ignoring case when doing completion.

					*'filetype'* *'ft'*
'filetype' 'ft'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+autocmd|
			feature}
	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
	executed.  Thus the value of 'filetype' is used in place of the file
	name.
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
	Example, for in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */ ~
	|FileType| |filetypes|
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
	one dot may appear.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'fillchars'* *'fcs'*
'fillchars' 'fcs'	string	(default "vert:|,fold:-")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			and |+folding| features}
	Characters to fill the statuslines and vertical separators.
	It is a comma separated list of items:

	  item		default		Used for ~
	  stl:c		' ' or '^'	statusline of the current window
	  stlnc:c	' ' or '-'	statusline of the non-current windows
	  vert:c	'|'		vertical separators |:vsplit|
	  fold:c	'-'		filling 'foldtext'
	  diff:c	'-'		deleted lines of the 'diff' option

	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, '^' or '-'
	otherwise.

	Example: >
	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:-,vert:\|,fold:-,diff:-
<	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
	be used when there is highlighting.

	for "stl" and "stlnc" only single-byte values are supported.

	The highlighting used for these items:
	  item		highlight group ~
	  stl:c		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
	  stlnc:c	StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
	  vert:c	VertSplit		|hl-VertSplit|
	  fold:c	Folded			|hl-Folded|
	  diff:c	DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|

					*'fkmap'* *'fk'* *'nofkmap'* *'nofk'*
'fkmap' 'fk'		boolean (default off)			*E198*
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Farsi character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option |i_CTRL-_|.  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'foldclose'* *'fcl'*
'foldclose' 'fcl'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When set to "all", a fold is closed when the cursor isn't in it and
	its level is higher than 'foldlevel'.  Useful if you want folds to
	automatically close when moving out of them.

						*'foldcolumn'* *'fdc'*
'foldcolumn' 'fdc'	number (default 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When non-zero, a column with the specified width is shown at the side
	of the window which indicates open and closed folds.  The maximum
	value is 12.
	See |folding|.

			*'foldenable'* *'fen'* *'nofoldenable'* *'nofen'*
'foldenable' 'fen'	boolean (default on)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
	with the |zi| command.  The 'foldcolumn' will remain blank when
	'foldenable' is off.
	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
	See |folding|.

						*'foldexpr'* *'fde'*
'foldexpr' 'fde'	string (default: "0")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			or |+eval| features}
	The expression used for when 'foldmethod' is "expr".  It is evaluated
	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldexpr' |textlock|.

						*'foldignore'* *'fdi'*
'foldignore' 'fdi'	string (default: "#")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Used only when 'foldmethod' is "indent".  Lines starting with
	characters in 'foldignore' will get their fold level from surrounding
	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

						*'foldlevel'* *'fdl'*
'foldlevel' 'fdl'	number (default: 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
	close fewer folds.
	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
	See |fold-foldlevel|.

						*'foldlevelstart'* *'fdls'*
'foldlevelstart' 'fdls'	number (default: -1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets 'foldlevel' when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
	ignores this option and closes all folds.
	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
	overrule the 'foldlevel' value for specific files.
	When the value is negative, it is not used.

						*'foldmarker'* *'fmr'* *E536*
'foldmarker' 'fmr'	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The start and end marker used when 'foldmethod' is "marker".  There
	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
	See |fold-marker|.

						*'foldmethod'* *'fdm'*
'foldmethod' 'fdm'	string (default: "manual")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
	|fold-expr|	expr	    'foldexpr' gives the fold level of a line.
	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

						*'foldminlines'* *'fml'*
'foldminlines' 'fml'	number (default: 1)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
	than 'foldminlines', a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

						*'foldnestmax'* *'fdn'*
'foldnestmax' 'fdn'	number (default: 20)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

						*'foldopen'* *'fdo'*
'foldopen' 'fdo'	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
							     search,tag,undo")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma separated
	list of items.
	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)

		item		commands ~
		all		any
		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
		insert		any command in Insert mode
		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
		percent		"%"
		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
	whole closed fold.
	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
	when text is inserted.
	To close folds you can re-apply 'foldlevel' with the |zx| command or
	set the 'foldclose' option to "all".

						*'foldtext'* *'fdt'*
'foldtext' 'fdt'	string (default: "foldtext()")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldtext' |textlock|.

					*'formatoptions'* *'fo'*
'formatoptions' 'fo'	string (Vim default: "tcq", Vi default: "vt")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  When the 'paste' option is
	on, no formatting is done (like 'formatoptions' is empty).  Commas can
	be inserted for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

					*'formatlistpat'* *'flp'*
'formatlistpat' 'flp'	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
	the "n" flag in 'formatoptions'.
	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
	like there is no match.
	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
	character and white space.

						*'formatprg'* *'fp'*
'formatprg' 'fp'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
	such a program.
	If the 'formatexpr' option is not empty it will be used instead.
	Otherwise, if 'formatprg' option is an empty string, the internal
	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'formatexpr'* *'fex'*
'formatexpr' 'fex'	string (default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
	operator or automatic formatting (see 'formatoptions').  When this
	option is empty 'formatprg' is used.

	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
		      it yet!

	Example: >
		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
<	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
	autoload/mylang.vim file in 'runtimepath'. |autoload|

	The expression is also evaluated when 'textwidth' is set and adding
	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
	
	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
	the internal format mechanism.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.

						*'fsync'* *'fs'*
'fsync' 'fs'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the library function fsync() will be called after writing a
	file.  This will flush a file to disk, ensuring that it is safely
	written even on filesystems which do metadata-only journaling.  This
	will force the harddrive to spin up on Linux systems running in laptop
	mode, so it may be undesirable in some situations.  Be warned that
	turning this off increases the chances of data loss after a crash.  On
	systems without an fsync() implementation, this variable is always
	off.
	Also see 'swapsync' for controlling fsync() on swap files.

				   *'gdefault'* *'gd'* *'nogdefault'* *'nogd'*
'gdefault' 'gd'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the ":substitute" flag 'g' is default on.  This means that
	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a 'g' flag
	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.

		command		'gdefault' on	'gdefault' off	~
		:s///		  subst. all	  subst. one
		:s///g		  subst. one	  subst. all
		:s///gg		  subst. all	  subst. one

	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'grepformat'* *'gfm'*
'grepformat' 'gfm'	string	(default "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Format to recognize for the ":grep" command output.
	This is a scanf-like string that uses the same format as the
	'errorformat' option: see |errorformat|.

						*'grepprg'* *'gp'*
'grepprg' 'gp'		string	(default "grep -n ",
					Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null",
					Win32: "findstr /n" or "grep -n",
						      VMS: "SEARCH/NUMBERS ")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain '%'
	and '#' characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
	also work well with a single file: >
		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
<	Special value: When 'grepprg' is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
	apply equally to 'grepprg'.
	For Win32, the default is "findstr /n" if "findstr.exe" can be found,
	otherwise it's "grep -n".
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'guicursor'* *'gcr'* *E545* *E546* *E548* *E549*
'guicursor' 'gcr'	string	(default "n-v-c:block-Cursor/lCursor,
					ve:ver35-Cursor,
					o:hor50-Cursor,
					i-ci:ver25-Cursor/lCursor,
					r-cr:hor20-Cursor/lCursor,
					sm:block-Cursor
					-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175",
				for MS-DOS and Win32 console:
					"n-v-c:block,o:hor50,i-ci:hor15,
					r-cr:hor30,sm:block")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled, and
			for MS-DOS and Win32 console}
	This option tells Vim what the cursor should look like in different
	modes.  It fully works in the GUI.  In an MSDOS or Win32 console, only
	the height of the cursor can be changed.  This can be done by
	specifying a block cursor, or a percentage for a vertical or
	horizontal cursor.
	For a console the 't_SI' and 't_EI' escape sequences are used.

	The option is a comma separated list of parts.  Each part consist of a
	mode-list and an argument-list:
		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode
		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
		ci	Command-line Insert mode
		cr	Command-line Replace mode
		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
		a	all modes
	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
			[only one of the above three should be present]
		blinkwait{N}				*cursor-blinking*
		blinkon{N}
		blinkoff{N}
			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
			cursor is not shown.  The times are in msec.  When one
			of the numbers is zero, there is no blinking.  The
			default is: "blinkwait700-blinkon400-blinkoff250".
			These numbers are used for a missing entry.  This
			means that blinking is enabled by default.  To switch
			blinking off you can use "blinkon0".  The cursor only
			blinks when Vim is waiting for input, not while
			executing a command.
			To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see
			|xterm-blink|.
		{group-name}
			a highlight group name, that sets the color and font
			for the cursor
		{group-name}/{group-name}
			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
			no language mappings are used, the other when they
			are. |language-mapping|

	Examples of parts:
	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	in Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
				highlight group
	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
				faster.

	The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
	blinking: "a:blinkon0"

	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg
<
					*'guifont'* *'gfn'*
						   *E235* *E596*
'guifont' 'gfn'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
	The first valid font is used.

	On systems where 'guifontset' is supported (X11) and 'guifontset' is
	not empty, then 'guifont' is not used.

	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
<	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.

	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.

	For Win32, GTK, Motif, Mac OS and Photon: >
	    :set guifont=*
<	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.

	The font name depends on the GUI used.  See |setting-guifont| for a
	way to set 'guifont' for various systems.

	For the GTK+ 2 GUI the font name looks like this: >
	    :set guifont=Andale\ Mono\ 11
<	That's all.  XLFDs are not used.  For Chinese this is reported to work
	well: >
	    if has("gui_gtk2")
	      set guifont=Bitstream\ Vera\ Sans\ Mono\ 12,Fixed\ 12
	      set guifontwide=Microsoft\ Yahei\ 12,WenQuanYi\ Zen\ Hei\ 12
	    endif
<
	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
<	Also see 'macatsui', it can help fix display problems.
								*E236*
	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
	width).  An exception is GTK 2: all fonts are accepted, but
	mono-spaced fonts look best.

	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.

	For the Win32 GUI					*E244* *E245*
	- takes these options in the font name:
		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		b   - bold
		i   - italic
		u   - underline
		s   - strikeout
		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".

	  Use a ':' to separate the options.
	- A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
	- Examples: >
	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5
<	See also |font-sizes|.

					*'guifontset'* *'gfs'*
					*E250* *E252* *E234* *E597* *E598*
'guifontset' 'gfs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+xfontset| feature}
			{not available in the GTK+ 2 GUI}
	When not empty, specifies two (or more) fonts to be used.  The first
	one for normal English, the second one for your special language.  See
	|xfontset|.
	Setting this option also means that all font names will be handled as
	a fontset name.  Also the ones used for the "font" argument of the
	|:highlight| command.
	The fonts must match with the current locale.  If fonts for the
	character sets that the current locale uses are not included, setting
	'guifontset' will fail.
	Note the difference between 'guifont' and 'guifontset': In 'guifont'
	the comma-separated names are alternative names, one of which will be
	used.  In 'guifontset' the whole string is one fontset name,
	including the commas.  It is not possible to specify alternative
	fontset names.
	This example works on many X11 systems: >

				*'guifontwide'* *'gfw'* *E231* *E533* *E534*
'guifontwide' 'gfw'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	When not empty, specifies a comma-separated list of fonts to be used
	for double-width characters.  The first font that can be loaded is
	used.
	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
	specified with 'guifont' and the same height.

	All GUI versions but GTK+ 2:

	'guifontwide' is only used when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" and
	'guifontset' is empty or invalid.
	When 'guifont' is set and a valid font is found in it and
	'guifontwide' is empty Vim will attempt to find a matching
	double-width font and set 'guifontwide' to it.

	GTK+ 2 GUI only:			*guifontwide_gtk2*

	If set and valid, 'guifontwide' is always used for double width
	characters, even if 'encoding' is not set to "utf-8".
	Vim does not attempt to find an appropriate value for 'guifontwide'
	automatically.  If 'guifontwide' is empty Pango/Xft will choose the
	font for characters not available in 'guifont'.  Thus you do not need
	to set 'guifontwide' at all unless you want to override the choice
	made by Pango/Xft.

	Windows +multibyte only:		*guifontwide_win_mbyte*

	If set and valid, 'guifontwide' is used for IME instead of 'guifont'.

						*'guiheadroom'* *'ghr'*
'guiheadroom' 'ghr'	number	(default 50)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for GTK and X11 GUI}
	The number of pixels subtracted from the screen height when fitting
	the GUI window on the screen.  Set this before the GUI is started,
	e.g., in your |gvimrc| file.  When zero, the whole screen height will
	be used by the window.  When positive, the specified number of pixel
	lines will be left for window decorations and other items on the
	screen.  Set it to a negative value to allow windows taller than the
	screen.

						*'guioptions'* *'go'*
'guioptions' 'go'	string	(default "egmrLtT"   (MS-Windows),
					 "aegimrLtT" (GTK, Motif and Athena))
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
	GUI should be used.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

	Valid letters are as follows:
							*guioptions_a* *'go-a'*
	  'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
		The same applies to the modeless selection.
								*'go-P'*
	  'P'	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
	  	register.
								*'go-A'*
	  'A'	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like 'a', but only
		applies to the modeless selection.

		    'guioptions'   autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
			 ""		 -			 -
			 "a"		yes			yes
			 "A"		 -			yes
			 "aA"		yes			yes

								*'go-c'*
	  'c'	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
		choices.
								*'go-e'*
	  'e'	Add tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.
		'guitablabel' can be used to change the text in the labels.
		When 'e' is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
		GTK, Motif, Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
								*'go-f'*
	  'f'	Foreground: Don't use fork() to detach the GUI from the shell
		where it was started.  Use this for programs that wait for the
		editor to finish (e.g., an e-mail program).  Alternatively you
		can use "gvim -f" or ":gui -f" to start the GUI in the
		foreground.  |gui-fork|
		Note: Set this option in the vimrc file.  The forking may have
		happened already when the |gvimrc| file is read.
								*'go-i'*
	  'i'	Use a Vim icon.  For GTK with KDE it is used in the left-upper
		corner of the window.  It's black&white on non-GTK, because of
		limitations of X11.  For a color icon, see |X11-icon|.
								*'go-m'*
	  'm'	Menu bar is present.
								*'go-M'*
	  'M'	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
		that this flag must be added in the .vimrc file, before
		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
		":syntax on" and ":filetype on" commands load the menu too).
								*'go-g'*
	  'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
		'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
		Exception: Athena will always use grey menu items.
								*'go-t'*
	  't'	Include tearoff menu items.  Currently only works for Win32,
		GTK+, and Motif 1.2 GUI.
								*'go-T'*
	  'T'	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32, GTK+, Motif, Photon
		and Athena GUIs.
								*'go-r'*
	  'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-R'*
	  'R'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-l'*
	  'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-L'*
	  'L'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-b'*
	  'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the 'h'
		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
								*'go-h'*
	  'h'	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|

	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.

								*'go-v'*
	  'v'	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
		vertical layout is used anyway.
								*'go-p'*
	  'p'	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
								*'go-F'*
	  'F'	Add a footer.  Only for Motif.  See |gui-footer|.


						*'guipty'* *'noguipty'*
'guipty'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	Only in the GUI: If on, an attempt is made to open a pseudo-tty for
	I/O to/from shell commands.  See |gui-pty|.

						*'guitablabel'* *'gtl'*
'guitablabel' 'gtl'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.

	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	'guitabtooltip' is used for the tooltip, see below.

	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  'e' must be
	present in 'guioptions'.  For the non-GUI tab pages line 'tabline' is
	used.

						*'guitabtooltip'* *'gtt'*
'guitabtooltip' 'gtt'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
	This option is otherwise just like 'guitablabel' above.
	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"
<

						*'helpfile'* *'hf'*
'helpfile' 'hf'		string	(default (MSDOS)  "$VIMRUNTIME\doc\help.txt"
					 (others) "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
	in 'runtimepath' will be used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
	spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'helpheight'* *'hh'*
'helpheight' 'hh'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
	current window, or (when the 'ea' option is on) the same as other
	windows.  When the height is less than 'helpheight', the height is
	set to 'helpheight'.  Set to zero to disable.

						*'helplang'* *'hlg'*
'helplang' 'hlg'	string	(default: messages language or empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Comma separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
	language and not in the English help.
	Example: >
		:set helplang=de,it
<	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
	files.
	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
	See |help-translated|.

				     *'hidden'* *'hid'* *'nohidden'* *'nohid'*
'hidden' 'hid'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When off a buffer is unloaded when it is |abandon|ed.  When on a
	buffer becomes hidden when it is |abandon|ed.  If the buffer is still
	displayed in another window, it does not become hidden, of course.
	The commands that move through the buffer list sometimes make a buffer
	hidden although the 'hidden' option is off: When the buffer is
	modified, 'autowrite' is off or writing is not possible, and the '!'
	flag was used.  See also |windows.txt|.
	To only make one buffer hidden use the 'bufhidden' option.
	This option is set for one command with ":hide {command}" |:hide|.
	WARNING: It's easy to forget that you have changes in hidden buffers.
	Think twice when using ":q!" or ":qa!".

						*'highlight'* *'hl'*
'highlight' 'hl'	string	(default (as a single string):
				     "8:SpecialKey,@:NonText,d:Directory,
				     e:ErrorMsg,i:IncSearch,l:Search,m:MoreMsg,
				     M:ModeMsg,n:LineNr,N:CursorLineNr,
				     r:Question,s:StatusLine,S:StatusLineNC,

				     R:SpellRare,L:SpellLocal,-:Conceal,
				     +:Pmenu,=:PmenuSel,
				     x:PmenuSbar,X:PmenuThumb")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option can be used to set highlighting mode for various
	occasions.  It is a comma separated list of character pairs.  The
	first character in a pair gives the occasion, the second the mode to
	use for that occasion.  The occasions are:
	|hl-SpecialKey|	 8  Meta and special keys listed with ":map"
	|hl-NonText|	 @  '~' and '@' at the end of the window and
			    characters from 'showbreak'
	|hl-Directory|	 d  directories in CTRL-D listing and other special
			    things in listings
	|hl-ErrorMsg|	 e  error messages
			 h  (obsolete, ignored)
	|hl-IncSearch|	 i  'incsearch' highlighting
	|hl-Search|	 l  last search pattern highlighting (see 'hlsearch')
	|hl-MoreMsg|	 m  |more-prompt|
	|hl-ModeMsg|	 M  Mode (e.g., "-- INSERT --")
	|hl-LineNr|	 n  line number for ":number" and ":#" commands, and
			    when 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set.
	|hl-CursorLineNr|  N like n for when 'cursorline' or 'relativenumber' is
			    set.
	|hl-Question|	 r  |hit-enter| prompt and yes/no questions
	|hl-StatusLine|	 s  status line of current window |status-line|
	|hl-StatusLineNC| S  status lines of not-current windows
	|hl-Title|	 t  Titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
	|hl-VertSplit|	 c  column used to separate vertically split windows
	|hl-Visual|	 v  Visual mode
	|hl-VisualNOS|	 V  Visual mode when Vim does is "Not Owning the
			    Selection" Only X11 Gui's |gui-x11| and
			    |xterm-clipboard|.
	|hl-WarningMsg|	 w  warning messages
	|hl-WildMenu|	 W  wildcard matches displayed for 'wildmenu'
	|hl-Folded|	 f  line used for closed folds
	|hl-FoldColumn|	 F  'foldcolumn'
	|hl-DiffAdd|	 A  added line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffChange|	 C  changed line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffDelete|	 D  deleted line in diff mode

	|hl-SpellRare|	 R  rare word |spell|
	|hl-SpellLocal|	 L  word from other region |spell|
	|hl-Conceal|	 -  the placeholders used for concealed characters
			    (see 'conceallevel')
	|hl-Pmenu|       +  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSel|    =  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSbar|   x  popup menu scrollbar
	|hl-PmenuThumb|  X  popup menu scrollbar thumb

	The display modes are:
		r	reverse		(termcap entry "mr" and "me")
		i	italic		(termcap entry "ZH" and "ZR")
		b	bold		(termcap entry "md" and "me")
		s	standout	(termcap entry "so" and "se")
		u	underline	(termcap entry "us" and "ue")
		c	undercurl	(termcap entry "Cs" and "Ce")
		n	no highlighting
		-	no highlighting
		:	use a highlight group
	The default is used for occasions that are not included.
	If you want to change what the display modes do, see |dos-colors|
	for an example.
	When using the ':' display mode, this must be followed by the name of
	a highlight group.  A highlight group can be used to define any type
	of highlighting, including using color.  See |:highlight| on how to
	define one.  The default uses a different group for each occasion.
	See |highlight-default| for the default highlight groups.

				 *'hlsearch'* *'hls'* *'nohlsearch'* *'nohls'*
'hlsearch' 'hls'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}
	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
	The type of highlighting used can be set with the 'l' occasion in the
	'highlight' option.  This uses the "Search" highlight group by
	default.  Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
	are not applied.
	See also: 'incsearch' and |:match|.
	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
	'redrawtime' specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
	with the 'h' flag in 'viminfo' |viminfo-h|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'history'* *'hi'*
'history' 'hi'		number	(Vim default: 50, Vi default: 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
	is remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).
	The maximum value is 10000.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

					 *'hkmap'* *'hk'* *'nohkmap'* *'nohk'*
'hkmap' 'hk'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Hebrew character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option.  See |rileft.txt|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

				 *'hkmapp'* *'hkp'* *'nohkmapp'* *'nohkp'*
'hkmapp' 'hkp'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, phonetic keyboard mapping is used.  'hkmap' must also be on.
	This is useful if you have a non-Hebrew keyboard.
	See |rileft.txt|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'icon'* *'noicon'*
'icon'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the icon text of the window will be set to the value of
	'iconstring' (if it is not empty), or to the name of the file
	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
	Overridden by the 'iconstring' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons (currently
	only X11 GUI and terminals with a non-empty 't_IS' option - these are
	Unix xterm and iris-ansi by default, where 't_IS' is taken from the
	builtin termcap).
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original icon will be
	restored if possible |X11|.  See |X11-icon| for changing the icon on
	X11.
	For MS-Windows the icon can be changed, see |windows-icon|.

						*'iconstring'*
'iconstring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the icon text of
	the window.  This happens only when the 'icon' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icon text
	(currently only X11 GUI and terminals with a non-empty 't_IS' option).
	Does not work for MS Windows.
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original icon will be
	restored if possible |X11|.
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.  See
	'titlestring' for example settings.
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

			*'ignorecase'* *'ic'* *'noignorecase'* *'noic'*
'ignorecase' 'ic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ignore case in search patterns.  Also used when searching in the tags
	file.
	Also see 'smartcase'.
	Can be overruled by using "\c" or "\C" in the pattern, see
	|/ignorecase|.

						*'imactivatefunc'* *'imaf'*
'imactivatefunc' 'imaf'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}
	This option specifies a function that will be called to
	activate/inactivate Input Method.

	Example: >
		function ImActivateFunc(active)
		  if a:active
		    ... do something
		  else
		    ... do something
		  endif
		  " return value is not used
		endfunction
		set imactivatefunc=ImActivateFunc
<
						*'imactivatekey'* *'imak'*
'imactivatekey' 'imak'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}				*E599*
	Specifies the key that your Input Method in X-Windows uses for
	activation.  When this is specified correctly, vim can fully control
	IM with 'imcmdline', 'iminsert' and 'imsearch'.
	You can't use this option to change the activation key, the option
	tells Vim what the key is.
	Format:
		[MODIFIER_FLAG-]KEY_STRING

	These characters can be used for MODIFIER_FLAG (case is ignored):
		S	    Shift key
		L	    Lock key
		C	    Control key
		1	    Mod1 key
		2	    Mod2 key
		3	    Mod3 key
		4	    Mod4 key
		5	    Mod5 key
	Combinations are allowed, for example "S-C-space" or "SC-space" are
	both shift+ctrl+space.
	See <X11/keysymdef.h> and XStringToKeysym for KEY_STRING.

	Example: >
		:set imactivatekey=S-space
<	"S-space" means shift+space.  This is the activation key for kinput2 +
	canna (Japanese), and ami (Korean).

				*'imcmdline'* *'imc'* *'noimcmdline'* *'noimc'*
'imcmdline' 'imc'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is always on when starting to edit a command
	line, unless entering a search pattern (see 'imsearch' for that).
	Setting this option is useful when your input method allows entering
	English characters directly, e.g., when it's used to type accented
	characters with dead keys.

				*'imdisable'* *'imd'* *'noimdisable'* *'noimd'*
'imdisable' 'imd'	boolean (default off, on for some systems (SGI))
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is never used.  This is useful to disable
	the IM when it doesn't work properly.
	Currently this option is on by default for SGI/IRIX machines.  This
	may change in later releases.

						*'iminsert'* *'imi'*
'iminsert' 'imi'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used in
	Insert mode.  Valid values:
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	2 is available only when compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime|, |+xim|
	or |global-ime|.
	To always reset the option to zero when leaving Insert mode with <Esc>
	this can be used: >
		:inoremap <ESC> <ESC>:set iminsert=0<CR>
<	This makes :lmap and IM turn off automatically when leaving Insert
	mode.
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Insert mode
	|i_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when setting 'keymap' to a valid keymap name.
	It is also used for the argument of commands like "r" and "f".
	The value 0 may not work correctly with Athena and Motif with some XIM
	methods.  Use 'imdisable' to disable XIM then.

						*'imsearch'* *'ims'*
'imsearch' 'ims'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used when
	entering a search pattern.  Valid values:
		-1	the value of 'iminsert' is used, makes it look like
			'iminsert' is also used when typing a search pattern
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Command-line mode
	|c_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when it is not -1 and setting the 'keymap'
	option to a valid keymap name.
	The value 0 may not work correctly with Athena and Motif with some XIM
	methods.  Use 'imdisable' to disable XIM then.

						*'imstatusfunc'* *'imsf'*
'imstatusfunc' 'imsf'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}
	This option specifies a function that is called to obtain the status
	of Input Method.  It must return a positive number when IME is active.

	Example: >
		function ImStatusFunc()
		  let is_active = ...do something
		  return is_active ? 1 : 0
		endfunction
		set imstatusfunc=ImStatusFunc
<
	NOTE: This function is invoked very often.  Keep it fast.

						*'include'* *'inc'*
'include' 'inc'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*include")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| feature}
	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
	"]I", "[d", etc.
	Normally the 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file name that
	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
	that are not in 'isfname', such as a space.  You can then use
	'includeexpr' to process the matched text.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'includeexpr'* *'inex'*
'includeexpr' 'inex'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| or |+eval| features}
	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the 'include'
	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
		:set includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'\\.','/','g')
<	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.

	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an 'include' statement.
	Also used for |<cfile>|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'includeexpr' |textlock|.

				 *'incsearch'* *'is'* *'noincsearch'* *'nois'*
'incsearch' 'is'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| features}
	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
	cursor to the match.
	When compiled with the |+reltime| feature Vim only searches for about
	half a second.  With a complicated pattern and/or a lot of text the
	match may not be found.  This is to avoid that Vim hangs while you
	are typing the pattern.
	The highlighting can be set with the 'i' flag in 'highlight'.
	See also: 'hlsearch'.
	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
	to the command line.  If 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' are set and the
	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
	converted to lowercase.
	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'indentexpr'* *'inde'*
'indentexpr' 'inde'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			or |+eval| features}
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
	in Insert mode as specified with the 'indentkeys' option.
	When this option is not empty, it overrules the 'cindent' and
	'smartindent' indenting.  When 'lisp' is set, this option is
	overridden by the Lisp indentation algorithm.
	When 'paste' is set this option is not used for indenting.
	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
	used for the indent).
	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
	and |lispindent()|.
	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
<	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the 'debug' option contains
	"msg".
	See |indent-expression|.
	NOTE: This option is made empty when 'compatible' is set.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'indentexpr' |textlock|.


						*'indentkeys'* *'indk'*
'indentkeys' 'indk'	string	(default "0{,0},:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only happens if 'indentexpr' isn't empty.
	The format is identical to 'cinkeys', see |indentkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting| and |indent-expression|.

			*'infercase'* *'inf'* *'noinfercase'* *'noinf'*
'infercase' 'inf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
	'ignorecase' is also on, the case of the match is adjusted depending
	on the typed text.  If the typed text contains a lowercase letter
	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
	With 'noinfercase' the match is used as-is.

			*'insertmode'* *'im'* *'noinsertmode'* *'noim'*
'insertmode' 'im'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Makes Vim work in a way that Insert mode is the default mode.  Useful
	if you want to use Vim as a modeless editor.  Used for |evim|.
	These Insert mode commands will be useful:
	- Use the cursor keys to move around.
	- Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command |i_CTRL-O|).  When
	  this is a mapping, it is executed as if 'insertmode' was off.
	  Normal mode remains active until the mapping is finished.
	- Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use
	  <Esc> to get back to Insert mode.  Note that CTRL-L moves the cursor
	  left, like <Esc> does when 'insertmode' isn't set.  |i_CTRL-L|

	These items change when 'insertmode' is set:
	- when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.
	- <Esc> in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.
	- <Esc> in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.
	- CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.
	- CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim, see |CTRL-Z|.	*i_CTRL-Z*
	However, when <Esc> is used inside a mapping, it behaves like
	'insertmode' was not set.  This was done to be able to use the same
	mappings with 'insertmode' set or not set.
	When executing commands with |:normal| 'insertmode' is not used.

	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'isfname'* *'isf'*
'isfname' 'isf'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
			    for AMIGA: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:"
			    for VMS: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,<,>,[,],:,;,~"
			    for OS/390: "@,240-249,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,="
			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
	It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.

	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
	'&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
	cmd.exe.

	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
	character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
	not work for digits).  Example:
		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
					128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
	If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
	included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
	option or the end of a range.  Example:
		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
	If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
	plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
				case ASCII letters.
		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
	expected.  Example:
		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
	A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
				comma, plus <Tab>.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'isident'* *'isi'*
'isident' 'isi'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
					   "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				otherwise: "@,48-57,_,192-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are included in identifiers.
	Identifiers are used in recognizing environment variables and after a
	match of the 'define' option.  It is also used for "\i" in a
	|pattern|.  See 'isfname' for a description of the format of this
	option.
	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding
	environment variables.  E.g., when '/' is included and Vim tries to
	expand "$HOME/.viminfo".  Maybe you should change 'iskeyword' instead.

						*'iskeyword'* *'isk'*
'iskeyword' 'isk'	string (Vim default for MS-DOS and Win32:
					    "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				   otherwise:  "@,48-57,_,192-255"
				Vi default: "@,48-57,_")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Keywords are used in searching and recognizing with many commands:
	"w", "*", "[i", etc.  It is also used for "\k" in a |pattern|.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.  For C
	programs you could use "a-z,A-Z,48-57,_,.,-,>".
	For a help file it is set to all non-blank printable characters except
	'*', '"' and '|' (so that CTRL-] on a command finds the help for that
	command).
	When the 'lisp' option is on the '-' character is always included.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'isprint'* *'isp'*
'isprint' 'isp'	string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2 and Macintosh:
				"@,~-255"; otherwise: "@,161-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are displayed directly on the
	screen.  It is also used for "\p" in a |pattern|.  The characters from
	space (ASCII 32) to '~' (ASCII 126) are always displayed directly,
	even when they are not included in 'isprint' or excluded.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.

	Non-printable characters are displayed with two characters:
		  0 -  31	"^@" - "^_"
		 32 - 126	always single characters
		   127		"^?"
		128 - 159	"~@" - "~_"
		160 - 254	"| " - "|~"
		   255		"~?"
	When 'encoding' is a Unicode one, illegal bytes from 128 to 255 are
	displayed as <xx>, with the hexadecimal value of the byte.
	When 'display' contains "uhex" all unprintable characters are
	displayed as <xx>.
	The SpecialKey highlighting will be used for unprintable characters.
	|hl-SpecialKey|

	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.  When a character
	is printable but it is not available in the current font, a
	replacement character will be shown.
	Unprintable and zero-width Unicode characters are displayed as <xxxx>.
	There is no option to specify these characters.

			*'joinspaces'* *'js'* *'nojoinspaces'* *'nojs'*
'joinspaces' 'js'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Insert two spaces after a '.', '?' and '!' with a join command.
	When 'cpoptions' includes the 'j' flag, only do this after a '.'.
	Otherwise only one space is inserted.
	NOTE: This option is set when 'compatible' is set.

							*'key'*
'key'			string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+cryptv|
			feature}
	The key that is used for encrypting and decrypting the current buffer.
	See |encryption| and 'cryptmethod'.
	Careful: Do not set the key value by hand, someone might see the typed
	key.  Use the |:X| command.  But you can make 'key' empty: >
		:set key=
<	It is not possible to get the value of this option with ":set key" or
	"echo &key".  This is to avoid showing it to someone who shouldn't
	know.  It also means you cannot see it yourself once you have set it,
	be careful not to make a typing error!
	You can use "&key" in an expression to detect whether encryption is
	enabled.  When 'key' is set it returns "*****" (five stars).

					*'keymap'* *'kmp'* *E544*
'keymap' 'kmp'		string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+keymap|
			feature}
	Name of a keyboard mapping.  See |mbyte-keymap|.
	Setting this option to a valid keymap name has the side effect of
	setting 'iminsert' to one, so that the keymap becomes effective.
	'imsearch' is also set to one, unless it was -1
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

					*'keymodel'* *'km'*
'keymodel' 'km'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of comma separated words, which enable special things that keys
	can do.  These values can be used:
	   startsel	Using a shifted special key starts selection (either
			Select mode or Visual mode, depending on "key" being
			present in 'selectmode').
	   stopsel	Using a not-shifted special key stops selection.
	Special keys in this context are the cursor keys, <End>, <Home>,
	<PageUp> and <PageDown>.
	The 'keymodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'keywordprg'* *'kp'*
'keywordprg' 'kp'	string	(default "man" or "man -s",  DOS: ":help",
						OS/2: "view /", VMS: "help")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the |K| command.  Environment variables are
	expanded |:set_env|.  ":help" may be used to access the Vim internal
	help.  (Note that previously setting the global option to the empty
	value did this, which is now deprecated.)
	When "man" is used, Vim will automatically translate a count for the
	"K" command to a section number.  Also for "man -s", in which case the
	"-s" is removed when there is no count.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Example: >
		:set keywordprg=man\ -s
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					*'langmap'* *'lmap'* *E357* *E358*
'langmap' 'lmap'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+langmap|
			feature}
	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
	inserted directly.  When in command mode the 'langmap' option takes
	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
	This is the opposite of the 'keymap' option, where characters are
	mapped in Insert mode.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				*greek*  >
	    :set langmap=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,QQ,R,S,T,U,V,WW,X,Y,Z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,qq,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z
<	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
<
	The 'langmap' option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
	part can be in one of two forms:
	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
	";", ',' and backslash itself.

	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

					*'langmenu'* *'lm'*
'langmenu' 'lm'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+menu| and
			|+multi_lang| features}
	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
	from the "lang" directory in 'runtimepath': >
		"lang/menu_" . &langmenu . ".vim"
<	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
	matter what $LANG is set to: >
		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
<	When 'langmenu' is empty, |v:lang| is used.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
	the English menus: >
		:set langmenu=none
<	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
<	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

					*'laststatus'* *'ls'*
'laststatus' 'ls'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
	status line:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two windows
		2: always
	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

			*'lazyredraw'* *'lz'* *'nolazyredraw'* *'nolz'*
'lazyredraw' 'lz'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
	update use |:redraw|.

			*'linebreak'* *'lbr'* *'nolinebreak'* *'nolbr'*
'linebreak' 'lbr'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in 'breakat' rather
	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
	'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth', this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
	If 'breakindent' is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
	of 'showbreak' is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
	is not used when the 'wrap' option is off.
	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
	with the right amount of white space.

						*'lines'* *E593*
'lines'			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
			global
	Number of lines of the Vim window.
	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the
	terminal initialization code.  Also see |posix-screen-size|.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can
	use this command to get the tallest window possible: >
		:set lines=999
<	Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 1000.
	If you get less lines than expected, check the 'guiheadroom' option.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of lines of the display, the display may be messed up.

						*'linespace'* *'lsp'*
'linespace' 'lsp'	number	(default 0, 1 for Win32 GUI)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in the GUI}
	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
	'linespace' to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
	though!

						*'lisp'* *'nolisp'*
'lisp'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Lisp mode: When <Enter> is typed in insert mode set the indent for
	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
	"cc" or "S".  'autoindent' must also be on for this to work.  The 'p'
	flag in 'cpoptions' changes the method of indenting: Vi compatible or
	better.  Also see 'lispwords'.
	The '-' character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the
	"=" operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than
	calling an external program if 'equalprg' is empty.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.
	{Vi: Does it a little bit differently}

						*'lispwords'* *'lw'*
'lispwords' 'lw'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Comma separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting.
	|'lisp'|

						*'list'* *'nolist'*
'list'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	List mode: Show tabs as CTRL-I is displayed, display $ after end of
	line.  Useful to see the difference between tabs and spaces and for
	trailing blanks.  Further changed by the 'listchars' option.

	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
		:set list lcs=tab:\ \ 
<
	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with 'textwidth'
	or 'wrapmargin') when 'cpoptions' includes 'L'.  See 'listchars' for
	changing the way tabs are displayed.

						*'listchars'* *'lcs'*
'listchars' 'lcs'	string	(default "eol:$")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Strings to use in 'list' mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
	comma separated list of string settings.
	  						*lcs-eol*
	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
			line.
	  						*lcs-tab*
	  tab:xy	Two characters to be used to show a tab.  The first
			char is used once.  The second char is repeated to
			fill the space that the tab normally occupies.
			"tab:>-" will show a tab that takes four spaces as
			">---".  When omitted, a tab is show as ^I.
	  						*lcs-trail*
	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
			trailing spaces are blank.
	  						*lcs-extends*
	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when 'wrap' is
			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
			screen.
	  						*lcs-precedes*
	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first column, when 'wrap'
			is off and there is text preceding the character
			visible in the first column.
	  						*lcs-conceal*
	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
			'conceallevel' is set to 1.
	  						*lcs-nbsp*
	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space (character
			0xA0, 160).  Left blank when omitted.

	The characters ':' and ',' should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
	be used when 'encoding' is "utf-8", otherwise only printable
	characters are allowed.  All characters must be single width.

	Examples: >
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
<	The "NonText" highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
	"precedes".  "SpecialKey" for "nbsp", "tab" and "trail".
	|hl-NonText| |hl-SpecialKey|

			*'lpl'* *'nolpl'* *'loadplugins'* *'noloadplugins'*
'loadplugins' 'lpl'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on the plugin scripts are loaded when starting up |load-plugins|.
	This option can be reset in your |vimrc| file to disable the loading
	of plugins.
	Note that using the "-u NONE" and "--noplugin" command line arguments
	reset this option. |-u| |--noplugin|

						*'macatsui'* *'nomacatsui'*
'macatsui'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{only available in Mac GUI version}
	This is a workaround for when drawing doesn't work properly.  When set
	and compiled with multi-byte support ATSUI text drawing is used.  When
	not set ATSUI text drawing is not used.  Switch this option off when
	you experience drawing problems.  In a future version the problems may
	be solved and this option becomes obsolete.  Therefore use this method
	to unset it: >
		if exists('&macatsui')
		   set nomacatsui
		endif
<	Another option to check if you have drawing problems is
	'termencoding'.

						*'magic'* *'nomagic'*
'magic'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
	See |pattern|.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with using patterns, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.  In any other situation write patterns that work when
	'magic' is on.  Include "\M" when you want to |/\M|.

						*'makeef'* *'mef'*
'makeef' 'mef'		string	(default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
	and the |:grep| command.
	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
	existing file.
	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See 'errorfile' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'makeprg'* *'mp'*
'makeprg' 'mp'		string	(default "make", VMS: "MMS")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
	This option may contain '%' and '#' characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|), 
	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S| 
	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	Note that a '|' must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
	"myfilter" do it like this: >
	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
<	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'matchpairs'* *'mps'*
'matchpairs' 'mps'	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
	other.
	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
	jump between two double quotes.
	The characters must be separated by a colon.
	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including '<' and
	'>' (HTML): >
		:set mps+=<:>

<	A more exotic example, to jump between the '=' and ';' in an
	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;

<	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
	the $VIMRUNTIME/macros directory. |add-local-help|

						*'matchtime'* *'mat'*
'matchtime' 'mat'	number	(default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}{in Nvi}
	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when 'showmatch' is
	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

						*'maxcombine'* *'mco'*
'maxcombine' 'mco'	number (default 2)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	The maximum number of combining characters supported for displaying.
	Only used when 'encoding' is "utf-8".
	The default is OK for most languages.  Hebrew may require 4.
	Maximum value is 6.
	Even when this option is set to 2 you can still edit text with more
	combining characters, you just can't see them.  Use |g8| or |ga|.
	See |mbyte-combining|.

						*'maxfuncdepth'* *'mfd'*
'maxfuncdepth' 'mfd'	number	(default 100)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
	more depth, set 'maxfuncdepth' to a bigger number.  But this will use
	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
	See also |:function|.

						*'maxmapdepth'* *'mmd'* *E223*
'maxmapdepth' 'mmd'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
	because the 'w' is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
	|key-mapping|.

						*'maxmem'* *'mm'*
'maxmem' 'mm'		number	(default between 256 to 5120 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for one buffer.  When this
	limit is reached allocating extra memory for a buffer will cause
	other memory to be freed.  The maximum usable value is about 2000000.
	Use this to work without a limit.  Also see 'maxmemtot'.

						*'maxmempattern'* *'mmp'*
'maxmempattern' 'mmp'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
							*E363*
	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the 'maxmempattern' limit.

						*'maxmemtot'* *'mmt'*
'maxmemtot' 'mmt'	number	(default between 2048 and 10240 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory in Kbyte to use for all buffers together.
	The maximum usable value is about 2000000 (2 Gbyte).  Use this to work
	without a limit.  On 64 bit machines higher values might work.  But
	hey, do you really need more than 2 Gbyte for text editing?
	Also see 'maxmem'.

						*'menuitems'* *'mis'*
'menuitems' 'mis'	number	(default 25)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+menu|
			feature}
	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

						*'mkspellmem'* *'msm'*
'mkspellmem' 'msm'	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
	this tuning is complicated.

	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
		{start},{inc},{added}

	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
	memory that is available to Vim.

	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
	will be allocated.

	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
	slower.

	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
<	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
	languages, no matter what you set 'mkspellmem' to.

				   *'modeline'* *'ml'* *'nomodeline'* *'noml'*
'modeline' 'ml'		boolean	(Vim default: on (off for root),
				 Debian: off, Vi default: off)
			local to buffer
						*'modelines'* *'mls'*
'modelines' 'mls'	number	(default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If 'modeline' is on 'modelines' gives the number of lines that is
	checked for set commands.  If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is zero
	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.
	NOTE: 'modeline' is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				*'modifiable'* *'ma'* *'nomodifiable'* *'noma'*
'modifiable' 'ma'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}		*E21*
	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The 'fileformat' and
	'fileencoding' options also can't be changed.
	Can be reset with the |-M| command line argument.

				*'modified'* *'mod'* *'nomodified'* *'nomod'*
'modified' 'mod'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
	when:
	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
	   when it was written.
	2. 'fileformat' or 'fileencoding' is different from its original
	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
	   values to the current values and the 'modified' option will be
	   reset.
	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
	an explanation.
	When 'buftype' is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
	will be ignored.

						*'more'* *'nomore'*
'more'			boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
	listing continues until finished.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'mouse'* *E538*
'mouse'			string	(default "", "a" for GUI, MS-DOS and Win32)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enable the use of the mouse.  Only works for certain terminals
	(xterm, MS-DOS, Win32 |win32-mouse|, QNX pterm, *BSD console with
	sysmouse and Linux console with gpm).  For using the mouse in the
	GUI, see |gui-mouse|.
	The mouse can be enabled for different modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
	Normally you would enable the mouse in all four modes with: >
		:set mouse=a
<	When the mouse is not enabled, the GUI will still use the mouse for
	modeless selection.  This doesn't move the text cursor.

	See |mouse-using|.  Also see |'clipboard'|.

	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
	"* register if there is access to an X-server.  The xterm handling of
	the mouse buttons can still be used by keeping the shift key pressed.
	Also see the 'clipboard' option.

			*'mousefocus'* *'mousef'* *'nomousefocus'* *'nomousef'*
'mousefocus' 'mousef'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only works in the GUI}
	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as
	a pointer transit may activate a window unintentionally.

			*'mousehide'* *'mh'* *'nomousehide'* *'nomh'*
'mousehide' 'mh'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only works in the GUI}
	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

						*'mousemodel'* *'mousem'*
'mousemodel' 'mousem'	string	(default "extend", "popup" for MS-DOS and Win32)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
	the right mouse button is used for:
	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
			like in an xterm.
	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
			with Microsoft Windows.
	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
			end Visual mode.
	Overview of what button does what for each model:
	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
	left drag	    start selection	start selection
	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
	right drag	    extend selection	-
	middle click	    paste		paste

	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
	You need to define this first, see |popup-menu|.

	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
	See |gui-mouse-mapping|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless
	selection (because that's handled in the GUI code directly).

	The 'mousemodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'mouseshape'* *'mouses'* *E547*
'mouseshape' 'mouses'	string	(default "i:beam,r:beam,s:updown,sd:cross,
					m:no,ml:up-arrow,v:rightup-arrow")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+mouseshape|
			feature}
	This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in
	different modes.  The option is a comma separated list of parts, much
	like used for 'guicursor'.  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
	and an argument-list:
		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
			In a normal window: ~
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode

			Others: ~
		c	appending to the command-line
		ci	inserting in the command-line
		cr	replacing in the command-line
		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or 'More' prompts
		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
		e	any mode, pointer below last window
		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
		a	everywhere

	The shape is one of the following:
	avail	name		looks like ~
	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
	w x	beam		I-beam
	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
	w x	no		The system's usual 'no input' pointer
	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
	  x	hand1		black hand
	  x	hand2		white hand
	  x	pencil		what you write with
	  x	question	big ?
	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)

	The "avail" column contains a 'w' if the shape is available for Win32,
	x for X11.
	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
	pointer.

	Example: >
		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
<	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

						*'mousetime'* *'mouset'*
'mousetime' 'mouset'	number	(default 500)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Only for GUI, MS-DOS, Win32 and Unix with xterm.  Defines the maximum
	time in msec between two mouse clicks for the second click to be
	recognized as a multi click.

						    *'mzquantum'* *'mzq'*
'mzquantum' 'mzq'	number	(default 100)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mzscheme|
			feature}
	The number of milliseconds between polls for MzScheme threads.
	Negative or zero value means no thread scheduling.

							*'nrformats'* *'nf'*
'nrformats' 'nf'	string	(default "octal,hex")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
		letter index a), b), etc.	  	*octal-nrformats*
	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
	recognized as octal or hex.

				*'number'* *'nu'* *'nonumber'* *'nonu'*
'number' 'nu'		boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the 'n' option is
	excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped line will not use the column of
	line numbers (this is the default when 'compatible' isn't set).
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.
						*number_relativenumber*
	The 'relativenumber' option changes the displayed number to be
	relative to the cursor.  Together with 'number' there are these
	four combinations (cursor in line 3):

              	'nonu'          'nu'            'nonu'          'nu'
		'nornu'         'nornu'         'rnu'           'rnu'

	    |apple          |  1 apple      |  2 apple      |  2 apple
	    |pear           |  2 pear       |  1 pear       |  1 pear
	    |nobody         |  3 nobody     |  0 nobody     |3   nobody
	    |there          |  4 there      |  1 there      |  1 there

						*'numberwidth'* *'nuw'*
'numberwidth' 'nuw'	number	(Vim default: 4  Vi default: 8)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
	when the 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set or printing lines
	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
	rows in the window, depending on whether 'number' or 'relativenumber'
	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 10.
	NOTE: 'numberwidth' is reset to 8 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'omnifunc'* *'ofu'*
'omnifunc' 'ofu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode omni
	completion with CTRL-X CTRL-O. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option is usually set by a filetype plugin:
	|:filetype-plugin-on|
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			    *'opendevice'* *'odev'* *'noopendevice'* *'noodev'*
'opendevice' 'odev'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only for MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2}
	Enable reading and writing from devices.  This may get Vim stuck on a
	device that can be opened but doesn't actually do the I/O.  Therefore
	it is off by default.
	Note that on MS-Windows editing "aux.h", "lpt1.txt" and the like also
	result in editing a device.


						*'operatorfunc'* *'opfunc'*
'operatorfunc' 'opfunc'	string	(default: empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies a function to be called by the |g@| operator.
	See |:map-operator| for more info and an example.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


					*'osfiletype'* *'oft'*
'osfiletype' 'oft'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option was supported on RISC OS, which has been removed.


						*'paragraphs'* *'para'*
'paragraphs' 'para'	string	(default "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate paragraphs.  These are pairs
	of two letters (see |object-motions|).

						*'paste'* *'nopaste'*
'paste'			boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Put Vim in Paste mode.  This is useful if you want to cut or copy
	some text from one window and paste it in Vim.  This will avoid
	unexpected effects.
	Setting this option is useful when using Vim in a terminal, where Vim
	cannot distinguish between typed text and pasted text.  In the GUI, Vim
	knows about pasting and will mostly do the right thing without 'paste'
	being set.  The same is true for a terminal where Vim handles the
	mouse clicks itself.
	This option is reset when starting the GUI.  Thus if you set it in
	your .vimrc it will work in a terminal, but not in the GUI.  Setting
	'paste' in the GUI has side effects: e.g., the Paste toolbar button
	will no longer work in Insert mode, because it uses a mapping.
	When the 'paste' option is switched on (also when it was already on):
		- mapping in Insert mode and Command-line mode is disabled
		- abbreviations are disabled
		- 'textwidth' is set to 0
		- 'wrapmargin' is set to 0
		- 'autoindent' is reset
		- 'smartindent' is reset
		- 'softtabstop' is set to 0
		- 'revins' is reset
		- 'ruler' is reset
		- 'showmatch' is reset
		- 'formatoptions' is used like it is empty
	These options keep their value, but their effect is disabled:
		- 'lisp'
		- 'indentexpr'
		- 'cindent'
	NOTE: When you start editing another file while the 'paste' option is
	on, settings from the modelines or autocommands may change the
	settings again, causing trouble when pasting text.  You might want to
	set the 'paste' option again.
	When the 'paste' option is reset the mentioned options are restored to
	the value before the moment 'paste' was switched from off to on.
	Resetting 'paste' before ever setting it does not have any effect.
	Since mapping doesn't work while 'paste' is active, you need to use
	the 'pastetoggle' option to toggle the 'paste' option with some key.

						*'pastetoggle'* *'pt'*
'pastetoggle' 'pt'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When non-empty, specifies the key sequence that toggles the 'paste'
	option.  This is like specifying a mapping: >
	    :map {keys} :set invpaste<CR>
<	Where {keys} is the value of 'pastetoggle'.
	The difference is that it will work even when 'paste' is set.
	'pastetoggle' works in Insert mode and Normal mode, but not in
	Command-line mode.
	Mappings are checked first, thus overrule 'pastetoggle'.  However,
	when 'paste' is on mappings are ignored in Insert mode, thus you can do
	this: >
	    :map <F10> :set paste<CR>
	    :map <F11> :set nopaste<CR>
	    :imap <F10> <C-O>:set paste<CR>
	    :imap <F11> <nop>
	    :set pastetoggle=<F11>
<	This will make <F10> start paste mode and <F11> stop paste mode.
	Note that typing <F10> in paste mode inserts "<F10>", since in paste
	mode everything is inserted literally, except the 'pastetoggle' key
	sequence.
	When the value has several bytes 'ttimeoutlen' applies.

						*'pex'* *'patchexpr'*
'patchexpr' 'pex'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

					*'patchmode'* *'pm'* *E205* *E206*
'patchmode' 'pm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
	name of the original file with the string in the 'patchmode' option
	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
	".org".  'backupdir' must not be empty for this to work (Detail: The
	backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the new file has
	been successfully written, that's why it must be possible to write a
	backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an empty file is
	created.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
	Using 'patchmode' for compressed files appends the extension at the
	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
	recognized as a compressed file.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

				*'path'* *'pa'* *E343* *E345* *E347* *E854*
'path' 'pa'		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
				   on OS/2:	  ".,/emx/include,,"
				   other systems: ".,,")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the 'path'
	option may be relative or absolute.
	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
<	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
<	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
	  backslash: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
<	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
		:set path=.
<	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
	  commas: >
		:set path=,,
<	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
	  "http://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
	  {not available when compiled without the |+path_extra| feature}
	- Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option: >
		:set path=.,c:\\include
<	  Or just use '/' instead: >
		:set path=.,c:/include
<	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
	the file!
	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
	'path', see |:checkpath|.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
		:set path-=
<	To add the current directory use: >
		:set path+=
<	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
		:let &path = &path . "," . substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')
<	Replace the ';' with a ':' or whatever separator is used.  Note that
	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

			*'preserveindent'* *'pi'* *'nopreserveindent'* *'nopi'*
'preserveindent' 'pi'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When changing the indent of the current line, preserve as much of the
	indent structure as possible.  Normally the indent is replaced by a
	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is
	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
	'expandtab' does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
	a Tab.
	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.
	NOTE: 'preserveindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.
	Also see 'copyindent'.
	Use |:retab| to clean up white space.

					*'previewheight'* *'pvh'*
'previewheight' 'pvh'	number (default 12)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Default height for a preview window.  Used for |:ptag| and associated
	commands.  Used for |CTRL-W_}| when no count is given.

					*'previewwindow'* *'nopreviewwindow'*

'previewwindow' 'pvw'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option
	set.  It's normally not set directly, but by using one of the commands
	|:ptag|, |:pedit|, etc.

						*'printdevice'* *'pdev'*
'printdevice' 'pdev'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			feature}
	The name of the printer to be used for |:hardcopy|.
	See |pdev-option|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for

			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+printer| feature}
	List of items that control the format of the output of |:hardcopy|.
	See |popt-option|.

						*'prompt'* *'noprompt'*

						*'pumheight'* *'ph'*
'pumheight' 'ph'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines the maximum number of items to show in the popup menu for
	Insert mode completion.  When zero as much space as available is used.
	|ins-completion-menu|.


						*'quoteescape'* *'qe'*
'quoteescape' 'qe'	string	(default "\")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	The characters that are used to escape quotes in a string.  Used for
	objects like a', a" and a` |a'|.
	When one of the characters in this option is found inside a string,
	the following character will be skipped.  The default value makes the
	text "foo\"bar\\" considered to be one string.

				   *'readonly'* *'ro'* *'noreadonly'* *'noro'*
'readonly' 'ro'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	If on, writes fail unless you use a '!'.  Protects you from
	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
	When using ":w!" the 'readonly' option is reset for the current
	buffer, unless the 'Z' flag is in 'cpoptions'.
	{not in Vi:}  When using the ":view" command the 'readonly' option is
	set for the newly edited buffer.

						*'redrawtime'* *'rdt'*
'redrawtime' 'rdt'	number	(default 2000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+reltime|
			feature}
	The time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  This applies to
	searching for patterns for 'hlsearch' and |:match| highlighting.
	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
	matches will be highlighted.  This is used to avoid that Vim hangs
	when using a very complicated pattern.

						*'regexpengine'* *'re'*
'regexpengine' 're'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This selects the default regexp engine. |two-engines|
	The possible values are:
		0	automatic selection
		1	old engine
		2	NFA engine
	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
	for debugging the regexp engine.

		*'relativenumber'* *'rnu'* *'norelativenumber'* *'nornu'*
'relativenumber' 'rnu'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
	When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
	line will not use the column of line numbers (this is the default when
	'compatible' isn't set).
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.
	
	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
	'number', see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
	options.

						*'remap'* *'noremap'*
'remap'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Allows for mappings to work recursively.  If you do not want this for
	a single entry, use the :noremap[!] command.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with Vim scripts, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.

                                               *'renderoptions'* *'rop'*
'renderoptions' 'rop'	string  (default: empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI and DIRECTX on
			MS-Windows}
	Select a text renderer and set its options.  The options depend on the
	renderer.

	Syntax: >
		set rop=type:{renderer}(,{name}:{value})*
<
	Currently, only one optional renderer is available.

	Other render types are currently not supported.

						*'report'*
'report'		number	(default 2)
			global
	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
	changed lines is more than 'report' a message will be given for most
	":" commands.  If you want it always, set 'report' to 0.
	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
	instead of the number of lines.

			 *'restorescreen'* *'rs'* *'norestorescreen'* *'nors'*
'restorescreen' 'rs'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only in Windows 95/NT console version}
	When set, the screen contents is restored when exiting Vim.  This also
	happens when executing external commands.

	For non-Windows Vim: You can set or reset the 't_ti' and 't_te'
	options in your .vimrc.  To disable restoring:
		set t_ti= t_te=
	To enable restoring (for an xterm):
		set t_ti=^[7^[[r^[[?47h t_te=^[[?47l^[8
	(Where ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to insert it)

				*'revins'* *'ri'* *'norevins'* *'nori'*
'revins' 'ri'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
	command in Insert mode, when 'allowrevins' is set.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' or 'paste' is set.

				 *'rightleft'* *'rl'* *'norightleft'* *'norl'*
'rightleft' 'rl'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.

			*'rightleftcmd'* *'rlc'*
'rightleftcmd' 'rlc'	string	(default "search")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:

		search		"/" and "?" commands

	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
	The 'rightleft' option must be set for 'rightleftcmd' to take effect.

					 *'ruler'* *'ru'* *'noruler'* *'noru'*
'ruler' 'ru'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
	comma.  When there is room, the relative position of the displayed
	text in the file is shown on the far right:
		Top	first line is visible
		Bot	last line is visible
		All	first and last line are visible
		45%	relative position in the file
	If 'rulerformat' is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
	ruler is shown there.  Otherwise it is shown in the last line of the
	screen.  If the statusline is given by 'statusline' (i.e. not empty),
	this option takes precedence over 'ruler' and 'rulerformat'
	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multi-byte character), both
	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
	separated with a dash.
	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
	This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'rulerformat'* *'ruf'*
'rulerformat' 'ruf'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it determines the content of the ruler
	string, as displayed for the 'ruler' option.
	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	The default ruler width is 17 characters.  To make the ruler 15
	characters wide, put "%15(" at the start and "%)" at the end.
	Example: >
		:set rulerformat=%15(%c%V\ %p%%%)

	3. In $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Vim.
							*after-directory*
	4. In the "after" directory in the system-wide Vim directory.  This is
	   for the system administrator to overrule or add to the distributed
	   defaults (rarely needed)
	5. In the "after" directory in your home directory.  This is for
	   personal preferences to overrule or add to the distributed defaults
	   or system-wide settings (rarely needed).

	Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "**" are allowed.  Normal
	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
	wildcards.
	See |:runtime|.
	Example: >
		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
<	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
	personal Vim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim" (shared between a
	group of people) and finally "$VIMRUNTIME" (the distributed runtime
	files).
	You probably should always include $VIMRUNTIME somewhere, to use the
	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME
	to find files which replace a distributed runtime files.  You can put
	a directory after $VIMRUNTIME to find files which add to distributed
	runtime files.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'scroll'* *'scr'*
'scroll' 'scr'		number	(default: half the window height)
			local to window
	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
	changes.  If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
	be used as the new value for 'scroll'.  Reset to half the window
	height with ":set scroll=0".   {Vi is a bit different: 'scroll' gives
	the number of screen lines instead of file lines, makes a difference
	when lines wrap}

			*'scrollbind'* *'scb'* *'noscrollbind'* *'noscb'*
'scrollbind' 'scb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file, see 'diff'.
	See |'scrollopt'| for options that determine how this option should be
	interpreted.
	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

						*'scrolljump'* *'sj'*
'scrolljump' 'sj'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
	height.
	NOTE: This option is set to 1 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'scrolloff'* *'so'*
'scrolloff' 'so'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
	when long lines wrap).
	For scrolling horizontally see 'sidescrolloff'.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'scrollopt'* *'sbo'*
'scrollopt' 'sbo'	string	(default "ver,jump")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
	'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
	Options.
	The following words are available:
	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
			around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
			reach a position before the start or after the end of
			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
			moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
			to the desired position when possible.
			When now making that window the current one, two
			things can be done with the relative offset:
			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
			   new relative offset will be used.
			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
			   same relative offset.
	Also see |scroll-binding|.
	When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
	even when "ver" isn't there.

						*'sections'* *'sect'*
'sections' 'sect'	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

						*'secure'* *'nosecure'* *E523*
'secure'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, ":autocmd", shell and write commands are not allowed in
	".vimrc" and ".exrc" in the current directory and map commands are
	displayed.  Switch it off only if you know that you will not run into
	problems, or when the 'exrc' option is off.  On Unix this option is
	only used if the ".vimrc" or ".exrc" is not owned by you.  This can be
	dangerous if the systems allows users to do a "chown".  You better set
	'secure' at the end of your ~/.vimrc then.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'selection'* *'sel'*
'selection' 'sel'	string	(default "inclusive")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
	in Visual and Select mode.
	Possible values:
	   value	past line     inclusive ~
	   old		   no		yes
	   inclusive	   yes		yes
	   exclusive	   yes		no
	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
	character past the line.
	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
	selection.
	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
	starting in Normal mode and 'virtualedit' empty.

	The 'selection' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'selectmode'* *'slm'*
'selectmode' 'slm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This is a comma separated list of words, which specifies when to start
	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
	Possible values:
	   mouse	when using the mouse
	   key		when using shifted special keys
	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
	See |Select-mode|.
	The 'selectmode' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'sessionoptions'* *'ssop'*
'sessionoptions' 'ssop'	string	(default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
					       help,options,tabpages,winsize")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma
	separated list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring
	something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   blank	empty windows
	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
	   curdir	the current directory
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
			String and Number types are stored.
	   help		the help window
	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
			options)
	   resize	size of the Vim window: 'lines' and 'columns'
	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
			will become the current directory (useful with
			projects accessed over a network from different
			systems)
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
			tab page separately
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS
	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
	   winsize	window sizes

	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir".
	When neither "curdir" nor "sesdir" is included, file names are stored
	with absolute paths.
	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing session files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

						*'shell'* *'sh'* *E91*
'shell' 'sh'		string	(default $SHELL or "sh",
					MS-DOS and Win32: "command.com" or
					"cmd.exe", OS/2: "cmd")
			global
	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
	value also check these options: 'shelltype', 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
	'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	If the name of the shell contains a space, you might need to enclose
	it in quotes.  Example: >
		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
<	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
	each space (to avoid ending the option value).  Also note that the
	"-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not part of the command
	name.  And Vim automagically recognizes the backslashes that are path
	separators.
	For Dos 32 bits (DJGPP), you can set the $DJSYSFLAGS environment
	variable to change the way external commands are executed.  See the
	libc.inf file of DJGPP.
	Under MS-Windows, when the executable ends in ".com" it must be
	included.  Thus setting the shell to "command.com" or "4dos.com"
	works, but "command" and "4dos" do not work for all commands (e.g.,
	filtering).
	For unknown reasons, when using "4dos.com" the current directory is
	changed to "C:\".  To avoid this set 'shell' like this: >
		:set shell=command.com\ /c\ 4dos
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellcmdflag'* *'shcf'*
'shellcmdflag' 'shcf'	string	(default: "-c";
				 MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell' does not
				 contain "sh" somewhere: "/c")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
	"bash.exe -c ls" or "command.com /c dir".  For the MS-DOS-like
	systems, the default is set according to the value of 'shell', to
	reduce the need to set this option by the user.  It's not used for
	OS/2 (EMX figures this out itself).
	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Also see |dos-shell| for MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellpipe'* *'sp'*
'shellpipe' 'sp'	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	For the Amiga and MS-DOS the default is ">".  The output is directly
	saved in a file and not echoed to the screen.
	For Unix the default it "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the 'shell' option is "csh" or
	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh" or "bash" the
	default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This means that stderr is also included.
	Before using the 'shell' option a path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses
	"sh".
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellquote'* *'shq'*
'shellquote' 'shq'	string	(default: ""; MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell'
					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
	quoting.  See 'shellxquote' to include the redirection.  It's
	probably not useful to set both options.
	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
	third-party shells on MS-DOS-like systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
	the value of 'shell', to reduce the need to set this option by the
	user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellredir'* *'srr'*
'shellredir' 'srr'	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
	and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the 'shell' option is "csh", "tcsh"
	or "zsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh" or "bash" the default becomes
	">%s 2>&1".  This means that stderr is also included.
	For Win32, the Unix checks are done and additionally "cmd" is checked
	for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".  Also, the same names with
	".exe" appended are checked for.
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellredir' option changes automatically unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shellslash'* *'ssl'* *'noshellslash'* *'nossl'*
'shellslash' 'ssl'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for MSDOS, MS-Windows and OS/2}
	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of command.com or
	cmd.exe.  Backward slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to
	forward slashes by Vim.
	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
	'shellslash' only works when a backslash can be used as a path
	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
		if exists('+shellslash')
<
			*'shelltemp'* *'stmp'* *'noshelltemp'* *'nostmp'*
'shelltemp' 'stmp'	boolean	(Vi default off, Vim default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
	Currently a pipe is only supported on Unix and MS-Windows 2K and
	later.  You can check it with: >
		:if has("filterpipe")
<	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
	and the 'shell' command does not need to support redirection.
	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
	can be detected.
	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
	'shelltemp' is off.

						*'shelltype'* *'st'*
'shelltype' 'st'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for the Amiga}
	On the Amiga this option influences the way how the commands work
	which use a shell.
	0 and 1: always use the shell
	2 and 3: use the shell only to filter lines
	4 and 5: use shell only for ':sh' command
	When not using the shell, the command is executed directly.

	0 and 2: use "shell 'shellcmdflag' cmd" to start external commands
	1 and 3: use "shell cmd" to start external commands

						*'shellxescape'* *'sxe'*
'shellxescape' 'sxe'	string	(default: "";
				 for MS-DOS and MS-Windows: "\"&|<>()@^")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When 'shellxquote' is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
	option will be escaped with a '^' character.  This makes it possible
	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

						*'shellxquote'* *'sxq'*
'shellxquote' 'sxq'	string	(default: "";
					for Win32, when 'shell' is cmd.exe: "("
					for Win32, when 'shell' contains "sh"
					somewhere: "\""
					for Unix, when using system(): "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
	'shellquote' to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
	to set both options.
	When the value is '(' then ')' is appended. When the value is '"('
	then ')"' is appended.
	When the value is '(' then also see 'shellxescape'.
	This is an empty string by default on most systems, but is known to be
	useful for on Win32 version, either for cmd.exe which automatically
	strips off the first and last quote on a command, or 3rd-party shells
	such as the MKS Korn Shell or bash, where it should be "\"".  The
	default is adjusted according the value of 'shell', to reduce the need
	to set this option by the user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shiftround'* *'sr'* *'noshiftround'* *'nosr'*
'shiftround' 'sr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'.  Applies to > and <
	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
	a multiple of 'shiftwidth' (this is Vi compatible).
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'shiftwidth'* *'sw'*
'shiftwidth' 'sw'	number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
	|'cindent'|, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
	When zero the 'ts' value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

						*'shortmess'* *'shm'*
'shortmess' 'shm'	string	(Vim default "filnxtToO", Vi default: "",
							POSIX default: "A")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
	It is a list of flags:
	 flag	meaning when present	~
	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
	  l	use "999L, 888C" instead of "999 lines, 888 characters"
	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message
		and "[a]" instead of "appended" for ':w >> file' command
	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]" instead of
		"[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac format]".
	  a	all of the above abbreviations

	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent message
		for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when 'autowrite' on)
	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous message.
		Also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn").
	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or "search
		hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages
	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long to fit
		on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most column.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too long to
		fit on the command line.  "..." will appear in the middle.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing swap file
		is found.
	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim |:intro|.
	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages.  For example,
		"-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only match",
		"Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.

	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
	would have got with 'shm' empty, use ":file!"
	Useful values:
	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				 *'shortname'* *'sn'* *'noshortname'* *'nosn'*
'shortname' 'sn'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi, not in MS-DOS versions}
	Filenames are assumed to be 8 characters plus one extension of 3
	characters.  Multiple dots in file names are not allowed.  When this
	option is on, dots in file names are replaced with underscores when
	adding an extension (".~" or ".swp").  This option is not available
	for MS-DOS, because then it would always be on.  This option is useful
	when editing files on an MS-DOS compatible filesystem, e.g., messydos
	or crossdos.  When running the Win32 GUI version under Win32s, this
	option is always on by default.

						*'showbreak'* *'sbr'* *E595*
'showbreak' 'sbr'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
		:set showbreak=>\ 
<	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
	this: >
		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
<	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
	The characters are highlighted according to the '@' flag in
	'highlight'.
	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
	If you want the 'showbreak' to appear in between line numbers, add the
	"n" flag to 'cpoptions'.

				     *'showcmd'* *'sc'* *'noshowcmd'* *'nosc'*
'showcmd' 'sc'		boolean	(Vim default: on, off for Unix, Vi default:
				 off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
	option off if your terminal is slow.
	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
	  means two characters and six bytes.
	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
	  {lines}x{columns}.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

			*'showfulltag'* *'sft'* *'noshowfulltag'* *'nosft'*
'showfulltag' 'sft'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
	required (coding style permitting).
	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
	'completeopt', because the completion from the search pattern may not
	match the typed text.

				 *'showmatch'* *'sm'* *'noshowmatch'* *'nosm'*
'showmatch' 'sm'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
	show the match can be set with 'matchtime'.
	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
	seen or not).  This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	When the 'm' flag is not included in 'cpoptions', typing a character
	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
	See the "sm" field in 'guicursor' for setting the cursor shape and
	blinking when showing the match.
	The 'matchpairs' option can be used to specify the characters to show
	matches for.  'rightleft' and 'revins' are used to look for opposite
	matches.
	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
	around |pi_paren.txt|.
	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

				 *'showmode'* *'smd'* *'noshowmode'* *'nosmd'*
'showmode' 'smd'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
	Use the 'M' flag in 'highlight' to set the type of highlighting for
	this message.
	When |XIM| may be used the message will include "XIM".  But this
	doesn't mean XIM is really active, especially when 'imactivatekey' is
	not set.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'showtabline'* *'stal'*
'showtabline' 'stal'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
	will be displayed:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
		2: always
	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
	line.
	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

						*'sidescroll'* *'ss'*
'sidescroll' 'ss'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
	the 'wrap' option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  When using
	a fast terminal use a small number or 1.  Not used for "zh" and "zl"
	commands.

						*'sidescrolloff'* *'siso'*
'sidescrolloff' 'siso'	number (default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
	right of the cursor if 'nowrap' is set.  Setting this option to a
	value greater than 0 while having |'sidescroll'| also at a non-zero
	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
	close to the beginning of the line.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

	Example: Try this together with 'sidescroll' and 'listchars' as
		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
		 onto the "extends" character:

		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
		 :set sidescrolloff=1


			*'smartcase'* *'scs'* *'nosmartcase'* *'noscs'*
'smartcase' 'scs'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Override the 'ignorecase' option if the search pattern contains upper
	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
	'ignorecase' option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
	"*" and "#" you can make 'smartcase' used by doing a "/" command,
	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			     *'smartindent'* *'si'* *'nosmartindent'* *'nosi'*
'smartindent' 'si'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+smartindent| feature}
	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  'cindent' does
	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
	see |C-indenting|.  When 'cindent' is on or 'indentexpr' is set,
	setting 'si' has no effect.  'indentexpr' is a more advanced
	alternative.
	Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent'.
	An indent is automatically inserted:
	- After a line ending in '{'.
	- After a line starting with a keyword from 'cinwords'.
	- Before a line starting with '}' (only with the "O" command).
	When typing '}' as the first character in a new line, that line is
	given the same indent as the matching '{'.
	When typing '#' as the first character in a new line, the indent for
	that line is removed, the '#' is put in the first column.  The indent
	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with '#' are not shifted
	right.
	NOTE: 'smartindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.  When 'paste'
	is set smart indenting is disabled.

				 *'smarttab'* *'sta'* *'nosmarttab'* *'nosta'*
'smarttab' 'sta'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
	'shiftwidth'.  'tabstop' or 'softtabstop' is used in other places.  A
	<BS> will delete a 'shiftwidth' worth of space at the start of the
	line.
	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to 'tabstop' or
	'softtabstop'.  'shiftwidth' is only used for shifting text left or
	right |shift-left-right|.
	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the 'expandtab'
	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the
	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

					*'softtabstop'* *'sts'*
'softtabstop' 'sts'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
	used.  This is useful to keep the 'ts' setting at its standard value
	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to 'sts'.  However,
	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
	When 'sts' is zero, this feature is off.
	When 'sts' is negative, the value of 'shiftwidth' is used.
	'softtabstop' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.
	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the number of
	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	The 'L' flag in 'cpoptions' changes how tabs are used when 'list' is
	set.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'spell'* *'nospell'*
'spell'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
	The languages are specified with 'spelllang'.

						*'spellcapcheck'* *'spc'*
'spellcapcheck' 'spc'	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
	Only used when 'spell' is set.
	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
	|set-spc-auto|.

						*'spellfile'* *'spf'*
'spellfile' 'spf'	string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
								*E765*
	It may also be a comma separated list of names.  A count before the
	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
	you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
	name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
	ignoring the region.
	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
	have to appear in 'spelllang'.
	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
	'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
	without region name will be found.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'spelllang'* *'spl'*
'spelllang' 'spl'	string	(default "en")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	A comma separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is
	on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example: >
		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
<	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
	The word list name must not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
	Britain.
	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
	words.
							*E757*
	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
	When 'encoding' is set the word lists are reloaded.  Thus it's a good
	idea to set 'spelllang' after setting 'encoding' to avoid loading the
	files twice.
	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.

	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
	will ask you if you want to download the file.

	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
	"spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
	up to the first comma, dot or underscore.
	Also see |set-spc-auto|.


						*'spellsuggest'* *'sps'*
'spellsuggest' 'sps'	string	(default "best")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
	items:

	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
			scoring to improve the ordering.

	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
			word.  That only works when the language specifies
			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
			better results.

	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
			simple typing mistakes.

	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
			suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
			minus two.

	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
			Example:
				theribal/terrible ~
			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
			comments.
			The word in the second column must be correct,
			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
			mistake.
			The file is used for all languages.

	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
			Example:
				[['the', 33], ['that', 44]]
			Set 'verbose' and use |z=| to see the scores that the
			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
			set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
			'verbose' option to a non-zero value.

	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
		:set sps=file:~/.vim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
<
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			*'splitbelow'* *'sb'* *'nosplitbelow'* *'nosb'*
'splitbelow' 'sb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
	one. |:split|

			*'splitright'* *'spr'* *'nosplitright'* *'nospr'*
'splitright' 'spr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window right of the
	current one. |:vsplit|

			   *'startofline'* *'sol'* *'nostartofline'* *'nosol'*
'startofline' 'sol'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.
	NOTE: This option is set when 'compatible' is set.

			   *'statusline'* *'stl'* *E540* *E542*
'statusline' 'stl'	string	(default empty)
			global or local to window |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the status line.
	Also see |status-line|.

	The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
	All fields except the {item} is optional.  A single percent sign can
	be given as "%%".  Up to 80 items can be specified.  *E541*

	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
<	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.

	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.

	Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
	'laststatus' is 2) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

	field	    meaning ~
	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by '-'.
	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by '-' & '0'.
		    Value must be 50 or less.
	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a '<'
		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by '>'number
		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
		    an exponential notation.
	item	    A one letter code as described below.

	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
	second character in "item" is the type:
		N for number
		S for string
		F for flags as described below
		- not applicable

	item  meaning ~
	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
	      directory.
	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if 'modifiable' is off.
	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See 'filetype'.
	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See 'filetype'.
	      {not available when compiled without |+autocmd| feature}
	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when |:lmap| mappings are
	      being used: "<keymap>"
	n N   Buffer number.
	b N   Value of character under cursor.
	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
	      {not available when compiled without |+byte_offset| feature}
	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	N N   Printer page number.  (Only works in the 'printheader' option.)
	l N   Line number.
	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
	c N   Column number.
	v N   Virtual column number.
	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to 'c'.
	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
	      percentage described for 'ruler'.  Always 3 in length, unless
	      translated.
	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
	{ NF  Evaluate expression between '%{' and '}' and substitute result.
	      Note that there is no '%' before the closing '}'.
	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
	T N   For 'tabline': start of tab page N label.  Use %T after the last
	      label.  This information is used for mouse clicks.
	X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X after the
	      label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current tab"
	      mark.  This information is used for mouse clicks.
	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
	      No width fields allowed.
	= -   Separation point between left and right aligned items.
	      No width fields allowed.
	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
	      windows.
	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|

	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
	when flags are used like in the examples below.

	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
<
	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
	line is displayed.  The current buffer and current window will be set
	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
	The variable "actual_curbuf" is set to the 'bufnr()' number of the
	real current buffer.

	The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.

	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
	setting an option without changing its value.  Example: >
		:let &ro = &ro

<	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
	described above.

	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
	If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
	edit your .vimrc or whatever with "vim -u NONE" to get it right.

	Examples:
	Emulate standard status line with 'ruler' set >
	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
<	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >
	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1*%M%*%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O'%02b'
	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
<	Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded >
	  :set statusline=...%r%{VarExists('b:gzflag','\ [GZ]')}%h...
<	In the |:autocmd|'s: >
	  :let b:gzflag = 1
<	And: >
	  :unlet b:gzflag
<	And define this function: >
	  :function VarExists(var, val)
	  :    if exists(a:var) | return a:val | else | return '' | endif
	  :endfunction
<
						*'suffixes'* *'su'*
'suffixes' 'su'		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes).
	See 'wildignore' for completely ignoring files.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	suffixes from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.

						*'suffixesadd'* *'sua'*
'suffixesadd' 'sua'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	Comma separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
		:set suffixesadd=.java
<
				*'swapfile'* *'swf'* *'noswapfile'* *'noswf'*
'swapfile' 'swf'	boolean (default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
	Careful: All text will be in memory:
		- Don't use this for big files.
		- Recovery will be impossible!
	A swapfile will only be present when |'updatecount'| is non-zero and
	'swapfile' is set.
	When 'swapfile' is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
	immediately deleted.  When 'swapfile' is set, and 'updatecount' is
	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
	Also see |swap-file| and |'swapsync'|.
	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'buftype' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

						*'swapsync'* *'sws'*
'swapsync' 'sws'	string	(default "fsync")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is not empty a swap file is synced to disk after
	writing to it.  This takes some time, especially on busy unix systems.
	When this option is empty parts of the swap file may be in memory and
	not written to disk.  When the system crashes you may lose more work.
	On Unix the system does a sync now and then without Vim asking for it,
	so the disadvantage of setting this option off is small.  On some
	systems the swap file will not be written at all.  For a unix system
	setting it to "sync" will use the sync() call instead of the default
	fsync(), which may work better on some systems.
	The 'fsync' option is used for the actual file.

						*'switchbuf'* *'swb'*
'switchbuf' 'swb'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
	Possible values (comma separated list):
	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
			pages.
	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
			Otherwise: do not split, use current window.
	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
			"split" when both are present.

						*'synmaxcol'* *'smc'*
'synmaxcol' 'smc'	number	(default 3000)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
	long line.
	Set to zero to remove the limit.

						*'syntax'* *'syn'*
'syntax' 'syn'		string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
	b:current_syntax variable does).
	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */ ~
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
		:set syntax=OFF
<	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
	'filetype' option: >
		:set syntax=ON
<	What actually happens when setting the 'syntax' option is that the
	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'tabline'* *'tal'*
'tabline' 'tal'		string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.

	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the 'showtabline'
	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When 'e' is in
	'guioptions' and the GUI supports a tab line 'guitablabel' is used
	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.

	The value is evaluated like with 'statusline'.  You can use
	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.

	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.


						*'tabpagemax'* *'tpm'*
'tabpagemax' 'tpm'	number	(default 10)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|


						*'tabstop'* *'ts'*
'tabstop' 'ts'		number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
	|:retab| command, and 'softtabstop' option.

	Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
	appear wrong in many places (e.g., when printing it).

	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
	1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
	2. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
	   'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
	   formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
	3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
	4. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
	   'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
	   changed.

			*'tagbsearch'* *'tbs'* *'notagbsearch'* *'notbs'*
'tagbsearch' 'tbs'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
	'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.

	When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
	'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.

	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
   !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
<	[The whitespace before and after the '0' must be a single <Tab>]

	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
	files listed in 'tags', and 'ignorecase' is set or a pattern is used
	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
	be found in the retry.

	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
	linear search can be avoided for the 'ignorecase' case.  Use a value
	of '2' in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be
	case-fold sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in
	the command: "sort -f -o tags tags".  For "Exuberant ctags" version
	5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be used
	for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for this
	to work.

	When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
	files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
	ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
	must be included in the tags file.
	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
	command-line completion and ":help").
	{Vi: always uses binary search in some versions}

						*'taglength'* *'tl'*
'taglength' 'tl'	number	(default 0)
			global
	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

			*'tagrelative'* *'tr'* *'notagrelative'* *'notr'*
'tagrelative' 'tr'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'tags'* *'tag'* *E433*
'tags' 'tag'		string	(default "./tags,tags", when compiled with
				|+emacs_tags|: "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
	When a file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path
	of the current file.  But only when the 'd' flag is not included in
	'cpoptions'.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
	|tags-option|.
	"*", "**" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags" will
	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags?" will find
	files called "tags?".  {not available when compiled without the
	|+path_extra| feature}
	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
	actually used.
	If Vim was compiled with the |+emacs_tags| feature, Emacs-style tag
	files are also supported.  They are automatically recognized.  The
	default value becomes "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS", unless case
	differences are ignored (MS-Windows).  |emacs-tags|
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	{Vi: default is "tags /usr/lib/tags"}

				*'tagstack'* *'tgst'* *'notagstack'* *'notgst'*
'tagstack' 'tgst'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in all versions of Vi}
	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

						*'term'* *E529* *E530* *E531*
'term'			string	(default is $TERM, if that fails:
				      in the GUI: "builtin_gui"
					on Amiga: "amiga"
					 on BeOS: "beos-ansi"
					  on Mac: "mac-ansi"
					 on MiNT: "vt52"
				       on MS-DOS: "pcterm"
					 on OS/2: "os2ansi"
					 on Unix: "ansi"
					  on VMS: "ansi"
				       on Win 32: "win32")
			global
	Name of the terminal.  Used for choosing the terminal control
	characters.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	For example: >
		:set term=$TERM
<	See |termcap|.

						*'termbidi'* *'tbidi'*
						*'notermbidi'* *'notbidi'*
'termbidi' 'tbidi'	boolean (default off, on for "mlterm")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
	Setting this option implies that 'rightleft' will not be set when
	'arabic' is set and the value of 'arabicshape' will be ignored.
	Note that setting 'termbidi' has the immediate effect that
	'arabicshape' is ignored, but 'rightleft' isn't changed automatically.
	This option is reset when the GUI is started.
	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

					*'termencoding'* *'tenc'*
'termencoding' 'tenc'	string	(default ""; with GTK+ 2 GUI: "utf-8"; with
						    Macintosh GUI: "macroman")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Encoding used for the terminal.  This specifies what character
	encoding the keyboard produces and the display will understand.  For
	the GUI it only applies to the keyboard ( 'encoding' is used for the
	display).  Except for the Mac when 'macatsui' is off, then
	'termencoding' should be "macroman".
	In the Win32 console version the default value is the console codepage
	when it differs from the ANSI codepage.
								*E617*
	Note: This does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.  After the GUI has been
	successfully initialized, 'termencoding' is forcibly set to "utf-8".
	Any attempts to set a different value will be rejected, and an error
	message is shown.
	For the Win32 GUI 'termencoding' is not used for typed characters,
	because the Win32 system always passes Unicode characters.
	When empty, the same encoding is used as for the 'encoding' option.
	This is the normal value.
	Not all combinations for 'termencoding' and 'encoding' are valid.  See
	|encoding-table|.
	The value for this option must be supported by internal conversions or
	iconv().  When this is not possible no conversion will be done and you
	will probably experience problems with non-ASCII characters.
	Example: You are working with the locale set to euc-jp (Japanese) and
	want to edit a UTF-8 file: >
		:let &termencoding = &encoding
		:set encoding=utf-8
<	You need to do this when your system has no locale support for UTF-8.

						*'terse'* *'noterse'*
'terse'			boolean	(default off)
			global
	When set: Add 's' flag to 'shortmess' option (this makes the message
	for a search that hits the start or end of the file not being
	displayed).  When reset: Remove 's' flag from 'shortmess' option.  {Vi
	shortens a lot of messages}

				   *'textauto'* *'ta'* *'notextauto'* *'nota'*
'textauto' 'ta'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformats'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textauto' is set, 'fileformats' is
	set to the default value for the current system.  When 'textauto' is
	reset, 'fileformats' is made empty.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				   *'textmode'* *'tx'* *'notextmode'* *'notx'*
'textmode' 'tx'		boolean	(MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2: default on,
				 others: default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformat'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textmode' is set, 'fileformat' is
	set to "dos".  When 'textmode' is reset, 'fileformat' is set to
	"unix".

						*'textwidth'* *'tw'*
'textwidth' 'tw'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
	this.  'textwidth' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.  When
	'textwidth' is zero, 'wrapmargin' may be used.  See also
	'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.
	When 'formatexpr' is set it will be used to break the line.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'thesaurus'* *'tsr'*
'thesaurus' 'tsr'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  Each line in
	the file should contain words with similar meaning, separated by
	non-keyword characters (white space is preferred).  Maximum line
	length is 510 bytes.
	To obtain a file to be used here, check out this ftp site:
	ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/  First get the README file.
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

			     *'tildeop'* *'top'* *'notildeop'* *'notop'*
'tildeop' 'top'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

				*'timeout'* *'to'* *'notimeout'* *'noto'*
'timeout' 'to'		boolean (default on)
			global
						*'ttimeout'* *'nottimeout'*
'ttimeout'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	These two options together determine the behavior when part of a
	mapped key sequence or keyboard code has been received:

	'timeout'    'ttimeout'		action	~
	   off		off		do not time out
	   on		on or off	time out on :mappings and key codes
	   off		on		time out on key codes

	If both options are off, Vim will wait until either the complete
	mapping or key sequence has been received, or it is clear that there
	is no mapping or key sequence for the received characters.  For
	example: if you have mapped "vl" and Vim has received 'v', the next
	character is needed to see if the 'v' is followed by an 'l'.
	When one of the options is on, Vim will wait for about 1 second for
	the next character to arrive.  After that the already received
	characters are interpreted as single characters.  The waiting time can
	be changed with the 'timeoutlen' option.
	On slow terminals or very busy systems timing out may cause
	malfunctioning cursor keys.  If both options are off, Vim waits
	forever after an entered <Esc> if there are key codes that start
	with <Esc>.  You will have to type <Esc> twice.  If you do not have
	problems with key codes, but would like to have :mapped key
	sequences not timing out in 1 second, set the 'ttimeout' option and
	reset the 'timeout' option.

	NOTE: 'ttimeout' is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'timeoutlen'* *'tm'*
'timeoutlen' 'tm'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in all versions of Vi}
						*'ttimeoutlen'* *'ttm'*
'ttimeoutlen' 'ttm'	number	(default -1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for a key code or mapped key
	sequence to complete.  Also used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G
	when part of a command has been typed.
	Normally only 'timeoutlen' is used and 'ttimeoutlen' is -1.  When a
	different timeout value for key codes is desired set 'ttimeoutlen' to
	a non-negative number.

		ttimeoutlen	mapping delay	   key code delay	~
		   < 0		'timeoutlen'	   'timeoutlen'
		  >= 0		'timeoutlen'	   'ttimeoutlen'

	The timeout only happens when the 'timeout' and 'ttimeout' options
	tell so.  A useful setting would be >
		:set timeout timeoutlen=3000 ttimeoutlen=100
<	(time out on mapping after three seconds, time out on key codes after
	a tenth of a second).

						*'title'* *'notitle'*
'title'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the title of the window will be set to the value of
	'titlestring' (if it is not empty), or to:
		filename [+=-] (path) - VIM
	Where:
		filename	the name of the file being edited
		-		indicates the file cannot be modified, 'ma' off
		+		indicates the file was modified
		=		indicates the file is read-only
		=+		indicates the file is read-only and modified
		(path)		is the path of the file being edited
		- VIM		the server name |v:servername| or "VIM"
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles
	(currently Amiga console, Win32 console, all GUI versions and
	terminals with a non- empty 't_ts' option - these are Unix xterm and
	iris-ansi by default, where 't_ts' is taken from the builtin termcap).
								*X11*
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original title will
	be restored if possible.  The output of ":version" will include "+X11"
	when HAVE_X11 was defined, otherwise it will be "-X11".  This also
	works for the icon name |'icon'|.
	But: When Vim was started with the |-X| argument, restoring the title
	will not work (except in the GUI).
	If the title cannot be restored, it is set to the value of 'titleold'.
	You might want to restore the title outside of Vim then.
	When using an xterm from a remote machine you can use this command:
	    rsh machine_name xterm -display $DISPLAY &
	then the WINDOWID environment variable should be inherited and the
	title of the window should change back to what it should be after
	exiting Vim.

								*'titlelen'*
'titlelen'		number	(default 85)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	Gives the percentage of 'columns' to use for the length of the window
	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
	shown.  A '<' character before the path name is used to indicate this.
	Using a percentage makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But
	it won't work perfectly, because the actual number of characters
	available also depends on the font used and other things in the title
	bar.  When 'titlelen' is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise,
	values from 1 to 30000 percent can be used.
	'titlelen' is also used for the 'titlestring' option.

						*'titleold'*
'titleold'		string	(default "Thanks for flying Vim")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+title|
			feature}
	This option will be used for the window title when exiting Vim if the
	original title cannot be restored.  Only happens if 'title' is on or
	'titlestring' is not empty.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
						*'titlestring'*
'titlestring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
	window.  This happens only when the 'title' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles (currently
	Amiga console, Win32 console, all GUI versions and terminals with a
	non-empty 't_ts' option).
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original title will
	be restored if possible |X11|.
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.
	Example: >
    :auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() . "/" . expand("%:p")
    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
<	The value of 'titlelen' is used to align items in the middle or right
	of the available space.
	Some people prefer to have the file name first: >
    :set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:~:.:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)
<	Note the use of "%{ }" and an expression to get the path of the file,
	without the file name.  The "%( %)" constructs are used to add a
	separating space only when needed.
	NOTE: Use of special characters in 'titlestring' may cause the display
	to be garbled (e.g., when it contains a CR or NL character).
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

				*'toolbar'* *'tb'*
'toolbar' 'tb'		string	(default "icons,tooltips")
			global
			{only for |+GUI_GTK|, |+GUI_Athena|, |+GUI_Motif| and
			|+GUI_Photon|}
	The contents of this option controls various toolbar settings.  The
	possible values are:
		icons		Toolbar buttons are shown with icons.
		text		Toolbar buttons shown with text.
		horiz		Icon and text of a toolbar button are
				horizontally arranged.  {only in GTK+ 2 GUI}
		tooltips	Tooltips are active for toolbar buttons.
	Tooltips refer to the popup help text which appears after the mouse
	cursor is placed over a toolbar button for a brief moment.

	If you want the toolbar to be shown with icons as well as text, do the
	following: >
		:set tb=icons,text
<	Motif and Athena cannot display icons and text at the same time.  They
	will show icons if both are requested.

	If none of the strings specified in 'toolbar' are valid or if
	'toolbar' is empty, this option is ignored.  If you want to disable
	the toolbar, you need to set the 'guioptions' option.  For example: >
		:set guioptions-=T
<	Also see |gui-toolbar|.

						*'toolbariconsize'* *'tbis'*
'toolbariconsize' 'tbis'	string	(default "small")
				global
				{not in Vi}
				{only in the GTK+ 2 GUI}
	Controls the size of toolbar icons.  The possible values are:
		tiny		Use tiny toolbar icons.
		small		Use small toolbar icons (default).
		medium		Use medium-sized toolbar icons.
		large		Use large toolbar icons.
	The exact dimensions in pixels of the various icon sizes depend on
	the current theme.  Common dimensions are large=32x32, medium=24x24,
	small=20x20 and tiny=16x16.

	If 'toolbariconsize' is empty, the global default size as determined
	by user preferences or the current theme is used.

			     *'ttybuiltin'* *'tbi'* *'nottybuiltin'* *'notbi'*
'ttybuiltin' 'tbi'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the builtin termcaps are searched before the external ones.
	When off the builtin termcaps are searched after the external ones.
	When this option is changed, you should set the 'term' option next for
	the change to take effect, for example: >
		:set notbi term=$TERM
<	See also |termcap|.
	Rationale: The default for this option is "on", because the builtin
	termcap entries are generally better (many systems contain faulty
	xterm entries...).

				     *'ttyfast'* *'tf'* *'nottyfast'* *'notf'*
'ttyfast' 'tf'		boolean	(default off, on when 'term' is xterm, hpterm,
					sun-cmd, screen, rxvt, dtterm or
					iris-ansi; also on when running Vim in
					a DOS console)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Indicates a fast terminal connection.  More characters will be sent to
	the screen for redrawing, instead of using insert/delete line
	commands.  Improves smoothness of redrawing when there are multiple
	windows and the terminal does not support a scrolling region.
	Also enables the extra writing of characters at the end of each screen
	line for lines that wrap.  This helps when using copy/paste with the
	mouse in an xterm and other terminals.

						*'ttymouse'* *'ttym'*
'ttymouse' 'ttym'	string	(default depends on 'term')
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in Unix and VMS, doesn't work in the GUI; not
			available when compiled without |+mouse|}
	Name of the terminal type for which mouse codes are to be recognized.
	Currently these strings are valid:
							*xterm-mouse*
	   xterm	xterm-like mouse handling.  The mouse generates
			"<Esc>[Mscr", where "scr" is three bytes:
				"s"  = button state
				"c"  = column plus 33
				"r"  = row plus 33
			This only works up to 223 columns!  See "dec",
			"urxvt", and "sgr" for solutions.
	   xterm2	Works like "xterm", but with the xterm reporting the
			mouse position while the mouse is dragged.  This works
			much faster and more precise.  Your xterm must at
			least at patchlevel 88 / XFree 3.3.3 for this to
			work.  See below for how Vim detects this
			automatically.
							*netterm-mouse*
	   netterm	NetTerm mouse handling.  The mouse generates
			"<Esc>}r,c<CR>", where "r,c" are two decimal numbers
			for the row and column.
							*dec-mouse*
	   dec		DEC terminal mouse handling.  The mouse generates a
			rather complex sequence, starting with "<Esc>[".
			This is also available for an Xterm, if it was
			configured with "--enable-dec-locator".
							*jsbterm-mouse*
	   jsbterm	JSB term mouse handling.
							*pterm-mouse*
	   pterm	QNX pterm mouse handling.
							*urxvt-mouse*
	   urxvt	Mouse handling for the urxvt (rxvt-unicode) terminal.
			The mouse works only if the terminal supports this
			encoding style, but it does not have 223 columns limit
			unlike "xterm" or "xterm2".
							*sgr-mouse*
	   sgr		Mouse handling for the terminal that emits SGR-styled
			mouse reporting.  The mouse works even in columns
			beyond 223.  This option is backward compatible with
			"xterm2" because it can also decode "xterm2" style
			mouse codes.

	The mouse handling must be enabled at compile time |+mouse_xterm|
	|+mouse_dec| |+mouse_netterm| |+mouse_jsbterm| |+mouse_urxvt|
	|+mouse_sgr|.
	Only "xterm"(2) is really recognized.  NetTerm mouse codes are always
	recognized, if enabled at compile time.  DEC terminal mouse codes
	are recognized if enabled at compile time, and 'ttymouse' is not
	"xterm", "xterm2", "urxvt" or "sgr" (because dec mouse codes conflict
	with them).
	This option is automatically set to "xterm", when the 'term' option is
	set to a name that starts with "xterm", "mlterm", or "screen", and
	'ttymouse' is not set already.
	Additionally, if vim is compiled with the |+termresponse| feature and
	|t_RV| is set to the escape sequence to request the xterm version
	number, more intelligent detection process runs.
	The "xterm2" value will be set if the xterm version is reported to be
	from 95 to 276.  The "sgr" value will be set if the xterm version is
	277 or highter.
	If you do not want 'ttymouse' to be set to "xterm2" or "sgr"
	automatically, set t_RV to an empty string: >
		:set t_RV=
<
						*'ttyscroll'* *'tsl'*
'ttyscroll' 'tsl'	number	(default 999)
			global
	Maximum number of lines to scroll the screen.  If there are more lines
	to scroll the window is redrawn.  For terminals where scrolling is
	very slow and redrawing is not slow this can be set to a small number,
	e.g., 3, to speed up displaying.

						*'ttytype'* *'tty'*
'ttytype' 'tty'		string	(default from $TERM)
			global
	Alias for 'term', see above.

						*'undodir'* *'udir'*
'undodir' 'udir'	string	(default ".")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	List of directory names for undo files, separated with commas.
	See |'backupdir'| for details of the format.
	"." means using the directory of the file.  The undo file name for
	"file.txt" is ".file.txt.un~".
	For other directories the file name is the full path of the edited
	file, with path separators replaced with "%".
	When writing: The first directory that exists is used. "." always
	works, no directories after "." will be used for writing.
	When reading all entries are tried to find an undo file.  The first
	undo file that exists is used.  When it cannot be read an error is
	given, no further entry is used.
	See |undo-persistence|.

				*'undofile'* *'noundofile'* *'udf'* *'noudf'*
'undofile' 'udf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
	file on buffer read.
	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by 'undodir'.
	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
	The undo file is not read when 'undoreload' causes the buffer from
	before a reload to be saved for undo.
	When 'undofile' is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

						*'undolevels'* *'ul'*
'undolevels' 'ul'	number	(default 100, 1000 for Unix, VMS,
						Win32 and OS/2)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used
	(nevertheless, a single change can use an unlimited amount of memory).
	Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
	itself: >
		set ul=0
<	But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the 'u' flag in
	'cpoptions', and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
	Also see |undo-two-ways|.
	Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
	current buffer: >
		setlocal ul=-1
<	This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.
	Also see |clear-undo|.

						*'undoreload'* *'ur'*
'undoreload' 'ur'	number	(default 10000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
	The save only happens when this options is negative or when the number
	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.

	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.

	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

						*'updatecount'* *'uc'*
'updatecount' 'uc'	number	(default: 200)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
	recovery |crash-recovery|).  'updatecount' is set to zero by starting
	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |'swapfile'|.
	When 'updatecount' is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
	created for all buffers that have 'swapfile' set.  When 'updatecount'
	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
	Also see |'swapsync'|.
	This option has no meaning in buffers where |'buftype'| is "nofile"
	or "nowrite".

						*'updatetime'* *'ut'*
'updatetime' 'ut'	number	(default 4000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
	|CursorHold| autocommand event.

						*'verbose'* *'vbs'*
'verbose' 'vbs'		number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi, although some versions have a boolean
			verbose option}
	When bigger than zero, Vim will give messages about what it is doing.
	Currently, these messages are given:
	>= 1	When the viminfo file is read or written.
	>= 2	When a file is ":source"'ed.
	>= 5	Every searched tags file and include file.
	>= 8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
	>= 9	Every executed autocommand.
	>= 12	Every executed function.
	>= 13	When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
	>= 14	Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
	>= 15	Every executed Ex command (truncated at 200 characters).

	This option can also be set with the "-V" argument.  See |-V|.
	This option is also set by the |:verbose| command.

	When the 'verbosefile' option is set then the verbose messages are not
	displayed.

						*'verbosefile'* *'vfile'*
'verbosefile' 'vfile'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
	When the file exists messages are appended.
	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when 'verbosefile' is made
	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.
	Setting 'verbosefile' to a new value is like making it empty first.
	The difference with |:redir| is that verbose messages are not
	displayed when 'verbosefile' is set.

						*'viewdir'* *'vdir'*
'viewdir' 'vdir'	string	(default for Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Win32:
							 "$VIM/vimfiles/view",
				 for Unix: "~/.vim/view",
				 for Macintosh: "$VIM:vimfiles:view"
				 for VMS: "sys$login:vimfiles/view"
				 for RiscOS: "Choices:vimfiles/view")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Name of the directory where to store files for |:mkview|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'viewoptions'* *'vop'*
'viewoptions' 'vop'	string	(default: "folds,options,cursor")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Changes the effect of the |:mkview| command.  It is a comma separated
	list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   cursor	cursor position in file and in window
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   options	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   localoptions same as "options"
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS

	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing view files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

				*'viminfo'* *'vi'* *E526* *E527* *E528*
'viminfo' 'vi'		string	(Vi default: "", Vim default for MS-DOS,
				   Windows and OS/2: '100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:,
				   for Amiga: '100,<50,s10,h,rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:
				   for others: '100,<50,s10,h)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+viminfo|
			feature}
	When non-empty, the viminfo file is read upon startup and written
	when exiting Vim (see |viminfo-file|).  The string should be a comma
	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
	the effect of their value.
	CHAR	VALUE	~
							*viminfo-!*
	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
							*viminfo-quote*
	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
		start of a comment!
							*viminfo-%*
	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
		buffer list is restored from the viminfo file.  Buffers
		without a file name and buffers for help files are not written
		to the viminfo file.
		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
		buffers are stored.
							*viminfo-'*
	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
		'viminfo' is non-empty.
		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
		|changelist| are stored in the viminfo file.
							*viminfo-/*
	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
		'history' is used.
							*viminfo-:*
	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*viminfo-<*
	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in Kbyte.
							*viminfo-@*
	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*viminfo-c*
	c	When included, convert the text in the viminfo file from the
		'encoding' used when writing the file to the current
		'encoding'.  See |viminfo-encoding|.
							*viminfo-f*
	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
							*viminfo-h*
	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the viminfo
		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
		has been used since the last search command.
							*viminfo-n*
	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
		the 'n'.  Must be the last one!  If the "-i" argument was
		given when starting Vim, that file name overrides the one
		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are expanded
		when opening the file, not when setting the option.
							*viminfo-r*
	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  You can
		also use it for temp files, e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is
		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
		characters.
							*viminfo-s*
	s	Maximum size of an item in Kbyte.  If zero then registers are
		not saved.  Currently only applies to registers.  The default
		"s10" will exclude registers with more than 10 Kbyte of text.
		Also see the '<' item above: line count limit.

	Example: >
	    :set viminfo='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/vim/viminfo
<
	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
			edited.
	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
			remembered.
	s100		Registers with more than 100 Kbyte text are skipped.
	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
	n~/vim/viminfo	The name of the file to use is "~/vim/viminfo".
	no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
			previous search and substitute patterns.
	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
	no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.

	When setting 'viminfo' from an empty value you can use |:rviminfo| to
	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					    *'virtualedit'* *'ve'*
'virtualedit' 've'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+virtualedit| feature}
	A comma separated list of these words:
	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line

	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
	editing a table.
	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
	not get a warning for it.

			*'visualbell'* *'vb'* *'novisualbell'* *'novb'* *beep*
'visualbell' 'vb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Use visual bell instead of beeping.  The terminal code to display the
	visual bell is given with 't_vb'.  When no beep or flash is wanted,
	use ":set vb t_vb=".
	Note: When the GUI starts, 't_vb' is reset to its default value.  You
	might want to set it again in your |gvimrc|.
	In the GUI, 't_vb' defaults to "<Esc>|f", which inverts the display
	for 20 msec.  If you want to use a different time, use "<Esc>|40f",
	where 40 is the time in msec.
	Does not work on the Amiga, you always get a screen flash.
	Also see 'errorbells'.

						*'warn'* *'nowarn'*
'warn'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Give a warning message when a shell command is used while the buffer
	has been changed.

		     *'weirdinvert'* *'wiv'* *'noweirdinvert'* *'nowiv'*
'weirdinvert' 'wiv'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the same effect as the 't_xs' terminal option.
	It is provided for backwards compatibility with version 4.x.
	Setting 'weirdinvert' has the effect of making 't_xs' non-empty, and
	vice versa.  Has no effect when the GUI is running.

						*'whichwrap'* *'ww'*
'whichwrap' 'ww'	string	(Vim default: "b,s", Vi default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
		char   key	  mode	~
		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
		 ~    "~"	 Normal
		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
	For example: >
		:set ww=<,>,[,]
<	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
	cursor.
	When 'l' is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
	line then it will not move to the next line.  This makes "dl", "cl",
	"yl" etc. work normally.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'wildchar'* *'wc'*
'wildchar' 'wc'		number	(Vim default: <Tab>, Vi default: CTRL-E)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
	command-line, as specified with 'wildmode'.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
	'wildcharm' for that.
	Although 'wc' is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
		:set wc=<Esc>
<	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'wildcharm'* *'wcm'*
'wildcharm' 'wcm'	number	(default: none (0))
			global
			{not in Vi}
	'wildcharm' works exactly like 'wildchar', except that it is
	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
	you'll never actually type 'wildcharm', just use it in mappings that
	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
		:set wcm=<C-Z>
		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
<	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

						*'wildignore'* *'wig'*
'wildignore' 'wig'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Also see 'suffixes'.
	Example: >
		:set wildignore=*.o,*.obj
<	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.


			*'wildignorecase'* *'wic'* *'nowildignorecase'* *'nowic'*
'wildignorecase' 'wic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
	Has no effect when 'fileignorecase' is set.
	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
	happens when there are special characters.


				*'wildmenu'* *'wmnu'* *'nowildmenu'* *'nowmnu'*
'wildmenu' 'wmnu'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available if compiled without the |+wildmenu|
			feature}
	When 'wildmenu' is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
	mode.  On pressing 'wildchar' (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
	the possible matches are shown just above the command line, with the
	first match highlighted (overwriting the status line, if there is
	one).  Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
	When 'wildmode' is used, "wildmenu" mode is used where "full" is
	specified.  "longest" and "list" do not start "wildmenu" mode.
	You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
	If there are more matches than can fit in the line, a ">" is shown on
	the right and/or a "<" is shown on the left.  The status line scrolls
	as needed.
	The "wildmenu" mode is abandoned when a key is hit that is not used
	for selecting a completion.
	While the "wildmenu" is active the following keys have special
	meanings:

	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
			  subdirectory or submenu.
	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
			  dot: move into a submenu.
	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
			  parent directory or parent menu.

	This makes the menus accessible from the console |console-menus|.

	If you prefer the <Left> and <Right> keys to move the cursor instead
	of selecting a different match, use this: >
		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
<
	The "WildMenu" highlighting is used for displaying the current match
	|hl-WildMenu|.

						*'wildmode'* *'wim'*
'wildmode' 'wim'	string	(Vim default: "full")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
	'wildchar'.  It is a comma separated list of up to four parts.  Each
	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of 'wildchar'.  The
	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of 'wildchar',
	The second part for the second use, etc.
	These are the possible values for each part:
	""		Complete only the first match.
	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
			the original string is used and then the first match
			again.
	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
			result in a longer string, use the next part.
	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start 'wildmenu' if it is
			enabled.
	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete first match.
	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete till longest common string.
	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.

	Examples: >
		:set wildmode=full
<	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
		:set wildmode=longest,full
<	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=list:full
<	List all matches and complete each full match >
		:set wildmode=list,full
<	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=longest,list
<	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.

						*'wildoptions'* *'wop'*
'wildoptions' 'wop'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of words that change how command line completion is done.
	Currently only one word is allowed:
	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
				d	#define
				f	function
	Also see |cmdline-completion|.

						*'winaltkeys'* *'wak'*
'winaltkeys' 'wak'	string	(default "menu")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only used in Win32, Motif, GTK and Photon GUI}
	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.  This can then be
		done with the |:simalt| command.
	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
		combinations cannot be mapped.
	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
		keys can be mapped.
	If the menu is disabled by excluding 'm' from 'guioptions', the ALT
	key is never used for the menu.
	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32 and with GTK <F10> will
	select the menu, unless it has been mapped.

						*'window'* *'wi'*
'window' 'wi'		number  (default screen height - 1)
			global
	Window height.  Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window,
	use 'lines' for that.
	Used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one window and the
	value is smaller than 'lines' minus one.  The screen will scroll
	'window' minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
	When 'window' is equal to 'lines' minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
	or equal to 'lines' it will be set to 'lines' minus 1.
	{Vi also uses the option to specify the number of displayed lines}

						*'winheight'* *'wh'* *E591*
'winheight' 'wh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
	cost of the height of other windows.
	Set 'winheight' to a small number for normal editing.
	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
	Other windows will be only 'winminheight' high.  This has the drawback
	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
	using the |VimEnter| event: >
		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
<	Minimum value is 1.
	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
	height of the current window.
	'winheight' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminheight' to set
	the minimal height for other windows.

			*'winfixheight'* *'wfh'* *'nowinfixheight'* *'nowfh'*
'winfixheight' 'wfh'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window height when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.  Set by default for the
	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

			*'winfixwidth'* *'wfw'* *'nowinfixwidth'* *'nowfw'*
'winfixwidth' 'wfw'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

						*'winminheight'* *'wmh'*
'winminheight' 'wmh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a
	status bar) if necessary.  They will return to at least one line when
	they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere to go.)
	Use 'winheight' to set the minimal height of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 3 is reasonable.

						*'winminwidth'* *'wmw'*
'winminwidth' 'wmw'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	The minimal width of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero columns (i.e. just
	a vertical separator) if necessary.  They will return to at least one
	line when they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere
	to go.)
	Use 'winwidth' to set the minimal width of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

						*'winwidth'* *'wiw'* *E592*
'winwidth' 'wiw'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Minimal number of columns for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer columns if there is not enough room.  If
	the current window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of
	the width of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window
	always fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.
	The width is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
	width of the current window.
	'winwidth' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminwidth' to set
	the minimal width for other windows.

						*'wrap'* *'nowrap'*
'wrap'			boolean	(default on)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text
	in the buffer, see 'textwidth' for that.
	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
	horizontally.
	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
	'linebreak' to get the break at a word boundary.
	To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
		:set sidescroll=5
		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
<	See 'sidescroll', 'listchars' and |wrap-off|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

						*'wrapmargin'* *'wm'*
'wrapmargin' 'wm'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
	and inserting continues on the next line.
	Options that add a margin, such as 'number' and 'foldcolumn', cause
	the text width to be further reduced.  This is Vi compatible.
	When 'textwidth' is non-zero, this option is not used.
	See also 'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.  {Vi: works differently
	and less usefully}

				   *'wrapscan'* *'ws'* *'nowrapscan'* *'nows'*
'wrapscan' 'ws'		boolean	(default on)			*E384* *E385*
			global
	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

						   *'write'* *'nowrite'*
'write'			boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
	writing a temporary file.

				   *'writeany'* *'wa'* *'nowriteany'* *'nowa'*
'writeany' 'wa'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

			     *'writebackup'* *'wb'* *'nowritebackup'* *'nowb'*
'writebackup' 'wb'	boolean	(default on with |+writebackup| feature, off
					otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
	the file was successfully written, unless the 'backup' option is
	also on.
	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
	NOTE: This option is set to the default value when 'compatible' is
	set.

						*'writedelay'* *'wd'*
'writedelay' 'wd'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The number of microseconds to wait for each character sent to the
	screen.  When non-zero, characters are sent to the terminal one by
	one.  For MS-DOS pcterm this does not work.  For debugging purposes.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL	  by Ralf Schandl

					*zOS* *z/OS* *OS390* *os390* *MVS*
This file contains the particulars for the z/OS UNIX version of Vim.

1. ASCII/EBCDIC dependent scripts	|zOS-has-ebcdic|
2. Putty and Colors                     |zOS-PuTTY|
3. Motif Problems			|zOS-Motif|
4. Bugs					|zOS-Bugs|
5. Limitations     			|zOS-limitations|
6. Open source on z/OS UNIX		|zOS-open-source|

Contributors: ~
The port to z/OS UNIX was done by Ralf Schandl for the Redbook mentioned
below.

Changes, bug-reports, or both by:

	David Moore
	Anthony Giorgio
	and others

==============================================================================
1. ASCII/EBCDIC dependent scripts	*OS390-has-ebcdic* *zOS-has-ebcdic*

For the internal script language the feature "ebcdic" was added.  With this
you can fix ASCII dependent scripts like this:
>
    if has("ebcdic")
	let space = 64
    else
	let space = 32
    endif
<

==============================================================================
2. PuTTY and Colors			*OS390-PuTTY* *zOS-PuTTY*

If you see problems with syntax highlighting or screen corruptions when you
connect to z/OS using Putty, try the following:

- Configure Putty as "vt220" terminal (Connection->Data)
- Add the following 3 lines to your vimrc:

>
    set t_AB=[4%p1%dm
    set t_AF=[3%p1%dm
    set t_CO=8
<

Note:  is one character use <C-V><Esc> to enter it.

==============================================================================
3. Motif Problems			*OS390-Motif* *zOS-Motif*

Note: Seen with Vim 6.*, never tested since.

It seems that in porting the Motif library to z/OS, a translation from EBCDIC
to ASCII for the accelerator characters of the pull-down menus was forgotten.
Even after I tried to hand convert the menus, the accelerator keys continued
to only work for the opening of menus (like <Alt-F> to open the file menu).
They still do not work for the menu items themselves (like <Alt-F>O to open
the file browser).

There is no solution for this yet.

==============================================================================
4. Bugs					*OS390-bugs* *zOS-Bugs*

- Vim will consistently hang when a large amount of text is selected in
  visual block mode.  This may be due to a memory corruption issue.  Note that
  this occurs in both the terminal and gui versions.

==============================================================================
5. Limitations     			*OS390-limitations* *zOS-limitations*

- No binary search in tag files.
  The program /bin/sort sorts by ASCII value by default.  This program is
  normally used by ctags to sort the tags.  There might be a version of
  ctags out there, that does it right, but we can't be sure.  So this seems to
  be a permanent restriction.

- The cscope interface (|cscope|) doesn't work for the version of cscope
  that we use on our mainframe.  We have a copy of version 15.0b12, and it
  causes Vim to hang when using the "cscope add" command.  I'm guessing that
  the binary format of the cscope database isn't quite what Vim is expecting.
  I've tried to port the current version of cscope (15.3) to z/OS, without
  much success.  If anyone is interested in trying, drop me a line if you
  make any progress.

- No glib/gtk support.  I have not been able to successfully compile glib on
  z/OS UNIX.  This means you'll have to live without the pretty gtk toolbar.
 
Disabled at compile time:
    - Multibyte support         (|multibyte|)
    - Right-to-left mode        (|rileft|)
    - Farsi key map             (|Farsi|)
    - Arabic language support   (|Arabic|)
    - Spell checking            (|spell|)

Never tested:
    - Perl interface		(|perl|)
    - Hangul input		(|hangul|)
    - Encryption support	(|encryption|)
    - Langmap			(|'langmap'|)
    - Python support		(|Python|)
    - Right-to-left mode	(|'rightleft'|)
    - SNiFF+ interface		(|sniff|)
    - TCL interface		(|tcl|)
    ...

==============================================================================
6. Open source on z/OS UNIX		*OS390-open-source* *zOS-open-source*

If you are interested in other Open Source Software on z/OS UNIX, have a
look at the following Redbook:

Last change: 2010 Aug 14


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*Amiga*
This file contains the particularities for the Amiga version of Vim.
There is also a section specifically for |MorphOS| below.

NOTE: The Amiga code is still included, but has not been maintained or tested.

Installation on the Amiga:
- Assign "VIM:" to the directory where the Vim "doc" directory is.  Vim will
  look for the file "VIM:doc/help.txt" (for the help command).
  Setting the environment variable $VIM also works.  And the other way around:
  when $VIM used and it is not defined, "VIM:" is used.
- With DOS 1.3 or earlier: Put "arp.library" in "libs:".  Vim must have been
  compiled with the |+ARP| feature enabled.  Make sure that newcli and run are
  in "C:" (for executing external commands).
- Put a shell that accepts a command with "-c" (e.g. "Csh" from Fish disk
  624) in "c:" or in any other directory that is in your search path (for
  executing external commands).

If you have sufficient memory you can avoid startup delays by making Vim and
csh resident with the command "rez csh vim".  You will have to put
"rezlib.library" in your "libs:" directory.  Under 2.0 you will need rez
version 0.5.

If you do not use digraphs, you can save some memory by recompiling without
the |+digraphs| feature.  If you want to use Vim with other terminals you can
recompile with the TERMCAP option.  Vim compiles with Manx 5.x and SAS 6.x.
See the makefiles and feature.h.

If you notice Vim crashes on some files when syntax highlighting is on, or
when using a search pattern with nested wildcards, it might be that the stack
is too small.  Try increasing the stack size.  In a shell use the Stack
command before launching Vim.  On the Workbench, select the Vim icon, use the
workbench "Info" menu and change the Stack field in the form.

If you want to use different colors set the termcap codes:
	t_mr (for inverted text)
	t_md (for bold text)
	t_me (for normal text after t_mr and t_md)
	t_so (for standout mode)
	t_se (for normal text after t_so)
	t_us (for underlined text)
	t_ue (for normal text after t_us)
	t_ZH (for italic text)
	t_ZR (for normal text after t_ZH)

Standard ANSI escape sequences are used.  The codes are:
30 grey char   40 grey cell   >0 grey background    0 all attributes off
31 black char  41 black cell  >1 black background   1 boldface
32 white char  42 white cell  >2 white background   2 faint
33 blue char   43 blue cell   >3 blue background    3 italic
34 grey char   44 grey cell   >4 grey background    4 underscore
35 black char  45 black cell  >5 black background   7 reverse video
36 white char  46 white cell  >6 white background   8 invisible
37 blue char   47 blue cell   >7 blue background

The codes with '>' must be the last.  The cell and background color should be
the same.  The codes can be combined by separating them with a semicolon.  For
example to get white text on a blue background: >
  :set t_me=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_se=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ue=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ZR=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_md=^V<Esc>[1;32;43;>3m
  :set t_mr=^V<Esc>[7;32;43;>3m
  :set t_so=^V<Esc>[0;31;43;>3m
  :set t_us=^V<Esc>[4;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ZH=^V<Esc>[3;32;43;>3m

When using multiple commands with a filter command, e.g. >
  :r! echo this; echo that
Only the output of the last command is used.  To fix this you have to group the
commands.  This depends on the shell you use (that is why it is not done
automatically in Vim).  Examples: >
  :r! (echo this; echo that)
  :r! {echo this; echo that}

Commands that accept a single file name allow for embedded spaces in the file
name.  However, when using commands that accept several file names, embedded
spaces need to be escaped with a backslash.

Vim for MorphOS							*MorphOS*

[this section mostly by Ali Akcaagac]

For the latest info about the MorphOS version:
	http://www.akcaagac.com/index_vim.html


Problems ~

There are a couple of problems which are not MorphOS related but more Vim and
UN*X related.  When starting up Vim in ram: it complains with a nag requester
from MorphOS please simply ignore it.  Another problem is when running Vim as
is some plugins will cause a few problems which you can ignore as well.
Hopefully someone will be fixing it over the time.

To pass all these problems for now you can either run:

	vim <file to be edited>

or if you want to run Vim plain and enjoy the motion of Helpfiles etc. it then
would be better to enter:

	vim --noplugins <of course you can add a file>


Installation ~

1) Please copy the binary 'VIM' file to c:
2) Get the Vim runtime package from:

	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/amiga/vim62rt.tgz

   and unpack it in your 'Apps' directory of the MorphOS installation.  For me
   this would create following directory hierarchy:

	MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62/...

3) Add the following lines to your s:shell-startup (Important!).

	;Begin VIM
	Set VIM=MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62
	Assign HOME: ""
	;End VIM

4) Copy the '.vimrc' file to s:

5) There is also a file named 'color-sequence' included in this archive.  This
   will set the MorphOS Shell to show ANSI colors.  Please copy the file to s:
   and change the s:shell-startup to:

	;Begin VIM
	Set VIM=MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62
	Assign HOME: ""
	Execute S:Color-Sequence
	Cls
	;End VIM

Last change: 2010 Aug 14


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*BeOS* *BeBox*
This is a port of Vim 5.1 to the BeOS Preview Release 2 (also known as PR2)
or later.

This file contains the particularities for the BeBox/BeOS version of Vim.  For
matters not discussed in this file, Vim behaves very much like the Unix
|os_unix.txt| version.

 1. General			|beos-general|
 2. Compiling Vim		|beos-compiling|
 3. Timeout in the Terminal	|beos-timeout|
 4. Unicode vs. Latin1		|beos-unicode|
 5. The BeOS GUI		|beos-gui|
 6. The $VIM directory		|beos-vimdir|
 7. Drag & Drop			|beos-dragndrop|
 8. Single Launch vs. Multiple
    Launch			|beos-launch|
 9. Fonts			|beos-fonts|
10. The meta key modifier	|beos-meta|
11. Mouse key mappings		|beos-mouse|
12. Color names			|beos-colors|
13. Compiling with Perl		|beos-perl|


1. General						*beos-general*

The default syntax highlighting mostly works with different foreground colors
to highlight items.  This works best if you set your Terminal window to a
darkish background and light letters.  Some middle-grey background (for
instance (r,g,b)=(168,168,168)) with black letters also works nicely.  If you
use the default light background and dark letters, it may look better to
simply reverse the notion of foreground and background color settings.  To do
this, add this to your .vimrc file (where <Esc> may need to be replaced with
the escape character): >

  :if &term == "beos-ansi"
  :    set t_AB=<Esc>[3%dm
  :    set t_AF=<Esc>[4%dm
  :endif


2. Compiling Vim					*beos-compiling*

From the Advanced Access Preview Release (AAPR) on, Vim can be configured with
the standard configure script.  To get the compiler and its flags right, use
the following command-line in the shell (you can cut and paste it in one go):

CC=$BE_C_COMPILER CFLAGS="$BE_DEFAULT_C_FLAGS -O7" \
    ./configure --prefix=/boot/home/config

$BE_C_COMPILER is usually "mwcc", $BE_DEFAULT_C_FLAGS is usually "-I- -I."

When configure has run, and you wish to enable GUI support, you must edit the
config.mk file so that the lines with GUI_xxx refer to $(BEOSGUI_xxx) instead
of $(NONE_xxx).
Alternatively you can make this change in the Makefile; it will have a
more permanent effect.  Search for "NONE_".

After compilation you need to add the resources to the binary.  Add the
following few lines near the end (before the line with "exit $exit_value") of
the link.sh script to do this automatically.

    rmattr BEOS:TYPE vim
    copyres os_beos.rsrc vim
    mimeset vim

Also, create a dummy file "strip":

    #!/bin/sh
    mimeset $1
    exit 0

You will need it when using "make install" to install Vim.

Now type "make" to compile Vim, then "make install" to install it.

If you want to install Vim by hand, you must copy Vim to $HOME/config/bin, and
create a bunch of symlinks to it ({g,r,rg}{vim,ex,view}).  Furthermore you must
copy Vim's configuration files to $HOME/config/share/vim:
vim-5.0s/{*.vim,doc,syntax}.  For completeness, you should also copy the nroff
manual pages to $HOME/config/man/man1.  Don't forget ctags/ctags and xxd/xxd!

Obviously, you need the unlimited linker to actually link Vim.  See
http://www.metrowerks.com for purchasing the CodeWarrior compiler for BeOS.
There are currently no other linkers that can do the job.

This won't be able to include the Perl or Python interfaces even if
you have the appropriate files installed. |beos-perl|


3. Timeout in the Terminal				*beos-timeout*

Because some POSIX/UNIX features are still missing[1], there is no direct OS
support for read-with-timeout in the Terminal.  This would mean that you cannot
use :mappings of more than one character, unless you also :set notimeout.
|'timeout'|

To circumvent this problem, I added a workaround to provide the necessary
input with timeout by using an extra thread which reads ahead one character.
As a side effect, it also makes Vim recognize when the Terminal window
resizes.

Function keys are not supported in the Terminal since they produce very
indistinctive character sequences.

These problems do not exist in the GUI.

[1]: there is no select() on file descriptors; also the termios VMIN and VTIME
settings do not seem to work properly.  This has been the case since DR7 at
least and still has not been fixed as of PR2.

							*beos-unicode*
4. Unicode vs. Latin1					*beos-utf8*

BeOS uses Unicode and UTF-8 for text strings (16-bit characters encoded to
8-bit characters).  Vim assumes ISO-Latin1 or other 8-bit character codes.
This does not produce the desired results for non-ASCII characters.  Try the
command :digraphs to see.  If they look messed up, use :set isprint=@ to
(slightly) improve the display of ISO-Latin1 characters 128-255.  This works
better in the GUI, depending on which font you use (below).

You may also use the /boot/bin/xtou command to convert UTF-8 files from (xtou
-f iso1 filename) or to (xtou -t iso1 filename) ISO-Latin1 characters.


5. The BeOS GUI						*beos-gui*

The BeOS GUI is no longer included.  It was not maintained for a while and
most likely didn't work.  If you want to work on this: get the Vim 6.x version
and merge it back in.


6. The $VIM directory					*beos-vimdir*

$VIM is the symbolic name for the place where Vims support files are stored.
The default value for $VIM is set at compile time and can be determined with >

  :version

The normal value is /boot/home/config/share/vim.  If you don't like it you can
set the VIM environment variable to override this, or set 'helpfile' in your
.vimrc: >

  :if version >= 500
  :    set helpfile=~/vim/vim54/doc/help.txt
  :    syntax on
  :endif


7. Drag & Drop						*beos-dragndrop*

You can drop files and directories on either the Vim icon (starts a new Vim
session, unless you use the File Types application to set Vim to be "Single
Launch") or on the Vim window (starts editing the files).  Dropping a folder
sets Vim's current working directory. |:cd| |:pwd| If you drop files or
folders with either SHIFT key pressed, Vim changes directory to the folder
that contains the first item dropped.  When starting Vim, there is no need to
press shift: Vim behaves as if you do.

Files dropped set the current argument list. |argument-list|


8. Single Launch vs. Multiple Launch			*beos-launch*

As distributed Vim's Application Flags (as seen in the FileTypes preference)
are set to Multiple Launch.  If you prefer, you can set them to Single Launch
instead.  Attempts to start a second copy of Vim will cause the first Vim to
open the files instead.  This works from the Tracker but also from the command
line.  In the latter case, non-file (option) arguments are not supported.

NB: Only the GUI version has a BApplication (and hence Application Flags).
This section does not apply to the GUI-less version, should you compile one.


9. Fonts						*beos-fonts*

Set fonts with >

  :set guifont=Courier10_BT/Roman/10

where the first part is the font family, the second part the style, and the
third part the size.  You can use underscores instead of spaces in family and
style.

Best results are obtained with monospaced fonts (such as Courier).  Vim
attempts to use all fonts in B_FIXED_SPACING mode but apparently this does not
work for proportional fonts (despite what the BeBook says).

Vim also tries to use the B_ISO8859_1 encoding, also known as ISO Latin 1.
This also does not work for all fonts.  It does work for Courier, but not for
ProFontISOLatin1/Regular (strangely enough).  You can verify this by giving the >

  :digraphs

command, which lists a bunch of characters with their ISO Latin 1 encoding.
If, for instance, there are "box" characters among them, or the last character
isn't a dotted-y, then for this font the encoding does not work.

If the font you specify is unavailable, you get the system fixed font.

Standard fixed-width system fonts are:

	      ProFontISOLatin1/Regular
		  Courier10_BT/Roman
		  Courier10_BT/Italic
		  Courier10_BT/Bold
		  Courier10_BT/Bold_Italic

Standard proportional system fonts are:

		    Swis721_BT/Roman
		    Swis721_BT/Italic
		    Swis721_BT/Bold
		    Swis721_BT/Bold_Italic
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Roman
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Italic
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Bold
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Bold_Italic
		   Baskerville/Roman
		   Baskerville/Italic
		   Baskerville/Bold
		   Baskerville/Bold_Italic
		 SymbolProp_BT/Regular

Try some of them, just for fun.


10. The meta key modifier				*beos-meta*

The META key modifier is obtained by the left or right OPTION keys.  This is
because the ALT (aka COMMAND) keys are not passed to applications.


11. Mouse key mappings					*beos-mouse*

Vim calls the various mouse buttons LeftMouse, MiddleMouse and RightMouse.  If
you use the default Mouse preference settings these names indeed correspond to
reality.  Vim uses this mapping:

    Button 1 -> LeftMouse,
    Button 2 -> RightMouse,
    Button 3 -> MiddleMouse.

If your mouse has fewer than 3 buttons you can provide your own mapping from
mouse clicks with modifier(s) to other mouse buttons.  See the file
vim-5.x/macros/swapmous.vim for an example.		|gui-mouse-mapping|


12. Color names						*beos-colors*

Vim has a number of color names built-in.  Additional names are read from the
file $VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt, if present.  This file is basically the color
database from X.  Names used from this file are cached for efficiency.


13. Compiling with Perl					*beos-perl*

Compiling with Perl support enabled is slightly tricky.  The Metrowerks
compiler has some strange ideas where to search for include files.  Since
several include files with Perl have the same names as some Vim header
files, the wrong ones get included.  To fix this, run the following Perl
script while in the vim-5.0/src directory: >

   preproc.pl > perl.h

    #!/bin/env perl
    # Simple #include expander, just good enough for the Perl header files.

    use strict;
    use IO::File;
    use Config;

    sub doinclude
    {
	my $filename = $_[0];
	my $fh = new IO::File($filename, "r");
	if (defined $fh) {
	    print "/* Start of $filename */\n";

	    while (<$fh>) {
		if (/^#include "(.*)"/) {
		    doinclude($1);
		    print "/* Back in $filename */\n";
		} else {
		    print $_;
		}
	    }
	    print "/* End of $filename */\n";

	    undef $fh;
	} else {
	    print "/* Cannot open $filename */\n";
	    print "#include \"$filename\"\n";
	}
    }

    chdir     $Config{installarchlib}."/CORE";
    doinclude "perl.h";

It expands the "perl.h" header file, using only other Perl header files.

Now you can configure & make Vim with the --enable-perlinterp option.
Be warned though that this adds about 616 kilobytes to the size of Vim!
Without Perl, Vim with default features and GUI is about 575K, with Perl
it is about 1191K.

Last change: 2006 Mar 30


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*dos* *DOS*
This file documents the common particularities of the MS-DOS and Win32
versions of Vim.  Also see |os_win32.txt| and |os_msdos.txt|.

1. File locations		|dos-locations|
2. Using backslashes		|dos-backslash|
3. Standard mappings		|dos-standard-mappings|
4. Screen output and colors	|dos-colors|
5. File formats			|dos-file-formats|
6. :cd command			|dos-:cd|
7. Interrupting			|dos-CTRL-Break|
8. Temp files			|dos-temp-files|
9. Shell option default		|dos-shell|

==============================================================================
1. File locations					*dos-locations*

If you keep the Vim executable in the directory that contains the help and
syntax subdirectories, there is no need to do anything special for Vim to
work.  No registry entries or environment variables need to be set.  Just make
sure that the directory is in your search path, or use a shortcut on the
desktop.

Your vimrc files ("_vimrc" and "_gvimrc") are normally located one directory
up from the runtime files.  If you want to put them somewhere else, set the
environment variable $VIM to the directory where you keep them.  Example: >
	set VIM=C:\user\piet
Will find "c:\user\piet\_vimrc".
Note: This would only be needed when the computer is used by several people.
Otherwise it's simpler to keep your _vimrc file in the default place.

If you move the executable to another location, you also need to set the $VIM
environment variable.  The runtime files will be found in "$VIM/vim{version}".
Example: >
	set VIM=E:\vim
Will find the version 5.4 runtime files in "e:\vim\vim54".
Note: This is _not_ recommended.  The preferred way is to keep the executable
in the runtime directory.

If you move your executable AND want to put your "_vimrc" and "_gvimrc" files
somewhere else, you must set $VIM to where you vimrc files are, and set
$VIMRUNTIME to the runtime files.  Example: >
	set VIM=C:\usr\piet
	set VIMRUNTIME=E:\vim\vim54
Will find "c:\user\piet\_vimrc" and the runtime files in "e:\vim\vim54".

See |$VIM| and |$VIMRUNTIME| for more information.

Under Windows 95, you can set $VIM in your C:\autoexec.bat file.  For
example: >
  set VIM=D:\vim
Under Windows NT, you can set environment variables for each user separately
under "Start/Settings/Control Panel->System", or through the properties in the
menu of "My Computer", under the Environment Tab.

==============================================================================
2. Using backslashes					*dos-backslash*

Using backslashes in file names can be a problem.  Vi halves the number of
backslashes for some commands.  Vim is a bit more tolerant and does not remove
backslashes from a file name, so ":e c:\foo\bar" works as expected.  But when
a backslash occurs before a special character (space, comma, backslash, etc.),
Vim removes the backslash.  Use slashes to avoid problems: ":e c:/foo/bar"
works fine.  Vim replaces the slashes with backslashes internally to avoid
problems with some MS-DOS programs and Win32 programs.

When you prefer to use forward slashes, set the 'shellslash' option.  Vim will
then replace backslashes with forward slashes when expanding file names.  This
is especially useful when using a Unix-like 'shell'.

==============================================================================
3. Standard mappings				*dos-standard-mappings*

The mappings for CTRL-PageUp and CTRL-PageDown have been removed, they now
jump to the next or previous tab page |<C-PageUp>| |<C-PageDown>|

If you want them to move to the first and last screen line you can use these
mappings:

key		key code     Normal/Visual mode	    Insert mode ~
CTRL-PageUp	<M-N><M-C-D>	    H		    <C-O>H
CTRL-PageDown	<M-N>v		    L$		    <C-O>L<C-O>$

Additionally, these keys are available for copy/cut/paste.  In the Win32
and DJGPP versions, they also use the clipboard.

Shift-Insert	paste text (from clipboard)			*<S-Insert>*
CTRL-Insert	copy Visual text (to clipboard)			*<C-Insert>*
CTRL-Del	cut Visual text (to clipboard)			*<C-Del>*
Shift-Del	cut Visual text (to clipboard)			*<S-Del>*

These mappings accomplish this (Win32 and DJGPP versions of Vim):

key		key code     Normal	Visual	    Insert ~
Shift-Insert	<M-N><M-T>   "*P	"-d"*P      <C-R><C-O>*
CTRL-Insert	<M-N><M-U>		"*y
Shift-Del	<M-N><M-W>		"*d
CTRL-Del	<M-N><M-X>		"*d

Or these mappings (non-Win32 version of Vim):

key		key code     Normal	Visual	    Insert ~
Shift-Insert	<M-N><M-T>   P		"-dP	    <C-R><C-O>"
CTRL-Insert	<M-N><M-U>		y
Shift-Del	<M-N><M-W>		d
CTRL-Del	<M-N><M-X>		d

When the clipboard is supported, the "* register is used.

==============================================================================
4. Screen output and colors				*dos-colors*

The default output method for the screen is to use bios calls.  This works
right away on most systems.  You do not need ansi.sys.  You can use ":mode" to
set the current screen mode.  See |:mode|.

To change the screen colors that Vim uses, you can use the |:highlight|
command.  The Normal highlight group specifies the colors Vim uses for normal
text.  For example, to get grey text on a blue background: >
	:hi Normal ctermbg=Blue ctermfg=grey
See |highlight-groups| for other groups that are available.

A DOS console does not support attributes like bold and underlining.  You can
set the color used in five modes with nine terminal options.  Note that this
is not necessary since you can set the color directly with the ":highlight"
command; these options are for backward compatibility with older Vim versions.
The |'highlight'| option specifies which of the five modes is used for which

^V is CTRL-V
^[ is <Esc>
You must replace xx with a decimal code, which is the foreground color number
and background color number added together:

COLOR			FOREGROUND	BACKGROUND	~
Black			    0		    0
DarkBlue		    1		   16
DarkGreen		    2		   32
DarkCyan		    3		   48
DarkRed			    4		   64
DarkMagenta		    5		   80

Red, LightRed		   12		  192 *
Magenta, LightMagenta	   13		  208 *
Yellow, LightYellow	   14		  224 *
White			   15		  240 *

* Depending on the display mode, the color codes above 128 may not be
  available, and code 128 will make the text blink.

When you use 0, the color is reset to the one used when you started Vim
(usually 7, lightgray on black, but you can override this.  If you have
overridden the default colors in a command prompt, you may need to adjust
some of the highlight colors in your vimrc---see below).
This is the default for t_me.

The defaults for the various highlight modes are:
	t_mr	112	 reverse mode: Black text (0) on LightGray (112)
	t_md	 15	 bold mode: White text (15) on Black (0)
	t_me	  0	 normal mode (revert to default)

	t_so	 31	 standout mode: White (15) text on DarkBlue (16)
	t_se	  0	 standout mode end (revert to default)

	t_czh	225	 italic mode: DarkBlue text (1) on Yellow (224)
	t_czr	  0	 italic mode end (revert to default)

	t_us	 67	 underline mode: DarkCyan text (3) on DarkRed (64)
	t_ue	  0	 underline mode end (revert to default)

These colors were chosen because they also look good when using an inverted
display, but you can change them to your liking.

Example: >
  :set t_mr=^V^[\|97m	" start of invert mode: DarkBlue (1) on Brown (96)
  :set t_md=^V^[\|67m	" start of bold mode: DarkCyan (3) on DarkRed (64)
  :set t_me=^V^[\|112m	" back to normal mode: Black (0) on LightGray (112)

  :set t_so=^V^[\|37m	" start of standout mode: DarkMagenta (5) on DarkGreen
									(32)
  :set t_se=^V^[\|112m	" back to normal mode: Black (0) on LightGray (112)

==============================================================================
5. File formats						*dos-file-formats*

If the 'fileformat' option is set to "dos" (which is the default), Vim accepts
a single <NL> or a <CR><NL> pair for end-of-line (<EOL>).  When writing a
file, Vim uses <CR><NL>.  Thus, if you edit a file and write it, Vim replaces
<NL> with <CR><NL>.

If the 'fileformat' option is set to "unix", Vim uses a single <NL> for <EOL>
and shows <CR> as ^M.

You can use Vim to replace <NL> with <CR><NL> by reading in any mode and
writing in Dos mode (":se ff=dos").
You can use Vim to replace <CR><NL> with <NL> by reading in Dos mode and
writing in Unix mode (":se ff=unix").

Vim sets 'fileformat' automatically when 'fileformats' is not empty (which is
the default), so you don't really have to worry about what you are doing.
					|'fileformat'| |'fileformats'|

If you want to edit a script file or a binary file, you should set the
'binary' option before loading the file.  Script files and binary files may
contain single <NL> characters which Vim would replace with <CR><NL>.  You can
set 'binary' automatically by starting Vim with the "-b" (binary) option.

==============================================================================
6. :cd command						*dos-:cd*

The ":cd" command recognizes the drive specifier and changes the current
drive.  Use ":cd c:" to make drive C the active drive.  Use ":cd d:\foo" to go
to the directory "foo" in the root of drive D.  Vim also recognizes UNC names
if the system supports them; e.g., ":cd \\server\share\dir".  |:cd|

==============================================================================
7. Interrupting						*dos-CTRL-Break*

Use CTRL-Break instead of CTRL-C to interrupt searches.  Vim does not detect
the CTRL-C until it tries to read a key.

==============================================================================
8. Temp files						*dos-temp-files*

Only for the 16 bit and 32 bit DOS version:
Vim puts temporary files (for filtering) in the first of these directories
that exists and in which Vim can create a file:
	$TMP
	$TEMP
	C:\TMP
	C:\TEMP
	current directory

For the Win32 version (both console and GUI):
Vim uses standard Windows functions to obtain a temporary file name (for
filtering).  The first of these directories that exists and in which Vim can
create a file is used:
	$TMP
	$TEMP
	current directory

==============================================================================
9. Shell option default					*dos-shell*

The default for the 'sh' ('shell') option is "command.com" on Windows 95 and
"cmd.exe" on Windows NT.  If SHELL is defined, Vim uses SHELL instead, and if
SHELL is not defined but COMSPEC is, Vim uses COMSPEC.  Vim starts external
commands with "<shell> /c <command_name>".  Typing CTRL-Z starts a new command
subshell.  Return to Vim with "exit".	|'shell'| |CTRL-Z|

If you are running a third-party shell, you may need to set the
|'shellcmdflag'| ('shcf') and |'shellquote'| ('shq') or |'shellxquote'|
('sxq') options.  Unfortunately, this also depends on the version of Vim used.
For example, with the MKS Korn shell or with bash, the values of the options
should be:

		DOS 16 bit	    DOS 32 bit		Win32  ~
'shellcmdflag'	   -c			-c		 -c
'shellquote'	   "
'shellxquote'						 "

For Dos 16 bit this starts the shell as:
	<shell> -c "command name" >file
For Win32 as:
	<shell> -c "command name >file"
For DOS 32 bit, DJGPP does this internally somehow.

When starting up, Vim checks for the presence of "sh" anywhere in the 'shell'
option.  If it is present, Vim sets the 'shellcmdflag' and 'shellquote' or
'shellxquote' options will be set as described above.

					*mac* *Mac* *macintosh* *Macintosh*

This file documents the particularities of the Macintosh version of Vim.

NOTE: This file is a bit outdated.  You might find more useful info here:
	http://macvim.org/

1. Filename Convention		|mac-filename|
2. .vimrc an .vim files		|mac-vimfile|
3. FAQ				|mac-faq|
4. Known Lack			|mac-lack|
5. Mac Bug Report		|mac-bug|
6. Compiling Vim		|mac-compile|

There was a Mac port for version 3.0 of Vim.  Here are the first few lines
from the old file:

VIM Release Notes
Initial Macintosh release, VIM version 3.0
19 October 1994

Eric Fischer
<enf1@midway.uchicago.edu>, <eric@jcp.uchicago.edu>, <etaoin@uchicago.edu>
5759 N. Guilford Ave
Indianapolis IN 46220 USA

==============================================================================
1. Filename Convention					*mac-filename*

Starting with Vim version 7 you can just use the unix path separators with
Vim. In order to determine if the specified filename is relative to the
current folder or absolute (i.e. relative to the "Desktop"), the following
algorithm is used:

	If the path start by a "/", the path is absolute
	If the path start by a ":", the path is relative
	If the path doesn't start by neither a "/" nor ":",
	  and a ":" is found before a "/" then the path is absolute
>
		:e /HD/text
		:e HD:text
<	Edit the file "text" of the disk "HD" >
		:e :src:main.c
		:e src/main.c
<	Edit the file "main.c" in the folder "src" in the current folder >
		:e os_mac.c
<	Edit the file "os_mac.c" in the current folder.

You can use the |$VIM| and |$VIMRUNTIME|  variable. >

		:so $VIMRUNTIME:syntax:syntax.vim

==============================================================================
2. .vimrc and .vim files				*mac-vimfile*

It is recommended to use Unix style line separators for Vim scripts, thus a
single newline character.

When starting up Vim will load the $VIMRUNTIME/macmap.vim script to define
default command-key mappings.

On older systems files starting with a dot "." are discouraged, thus the rc
files are named "vimrc" or "_vimrc" and "gvimrc" or "_gvimrc".  These files
can be in any format (mac, dos or unix).  Vim can handle any file format when
the |'nocompatible'| option is set, otherwise it will only handle mac format
files.

==============================================================================
3. Mac FAQ						*mac-faq*

On the internet:  http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php#FAQ

Q: I can't enter non-ASCII character in Apple Terminal.
A: Under Window Settings, Emulation, make sure that "Escape non-ASCII
   characters" is not checked.

Q: How do I start the GUI from the command line?
A: Assuming that Vim.app is located in /Applications:
	open /Applications/Vim.app
   Or:
	/Applications/Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g  {arguments}

Q: How can I set $PATH to something reasonable when I start Vim.app from the
   GUI or with open?
A: The following trick works with most shells.  Put it in your vimrc file.
   This is included in the system vimrc file included with the binaries
   distributed at macvim.org . >
	let s:path = system("echo echo VIMPATH'${PATH}' | $SHELL -l")
	let $PATH = matchstr(s:path, 'VIMPATH\zs.\{-}\ze\n')

==============================================================================
4. Mac Lack						*mac-lack*

In a terminal CTRL-^ needs to be entered as Shift-Control-6.  CTRL-@ as
Shift-Control-2.

==============================================================================
5. Mac Bug Report					*mac-bug*

When reporting any Mac specific bug or feature change, please use the vim-mac
maillist |vim-mac|.  However, you need to be subscribed.  An alternative is to
send a message to the current MacVim maintainers:

	mac@vim.org

==============================================================================
6. Compiling Vim					*mac-compile*

See the file "src/INSTALLmac.txt" that comes with the source files.

							*MiNT* *Atari*
This file contains the particularities for the Atari MiNT version of Vim.

For compiling Vim on the Atari running MiNT see "INSTALL" and "Makefile"
in the src directory.

Vim for MiNT behaves almost exactly like the Unix version.
The Unix behavior described in the documentation also refers to the
MiNT version of Vim unless explicitly stated otherwise.

For wildcard expansion of <~> (home directory) you need a shell that
expands the tilde.  The vanilla Bourne shell doesn't recognize it.
With csh and ksh it should work OK.

The MiNT version of vim needs the termcap file /etc/termcap with the
terminal capabilities of your terminal.  Builtin termcaps are
supported for the vt52 terminal.  Termcap entries for the TOSWIN window
manager and the virtual console terminals have been appended to the
termcap file that comes with the Vim distribution.

If you should encounter problems with swapped <BS> and <Del> keys, see
|:fixdel|.

Because terminal updating under MiNT is often slow (e.g. serial line
terminal), the 'showcmd' and 'ruler' options are default off.
If you have a fast terminal, try setting them on.  You might
also want to set 'ttyfast'.

For compiling Vim see src/INSTALL.pc.			*msdos-compiling*

==============================================================================
1. Two versions for MS-DOS				*msdos-versions*

There are two versions of Vim that can be used with MS-DOS machines:

							*dos16*
Dos16 version	Can be used on any MS-DOS system, only uses up to 640 Kbyte of
		memory.  Also runs on OS/2, Windows 95, and NT.  Excludes some
		Vim-specific features (autocommands, syntax highlighting,
		etc.).  Recommended for use on pre-386 machines.
							*dos32*
Dos32 version	Requires 386 processor and a |DPMI| driver, uses all
		available memory.  Supports long file names and the Windows
		clipboard, but NOT on Windows NT.  Recommended for MS-DOS,
		Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.

There are also two versions that run under Windows:
Win32 version   Requires Windows 95 or Windows NT, uses all available
		memory, supports long file names, etc.  Has some problems on
		Windows 95.  Recommended for Windows NT.  See |os_win32.txt|
Win32 GUI	Requirements like the Win32 version, but runs in its own
		window, instead of a console.  Has scrollbars, menu, etc.
		Recommended for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  See |gui-w32|.

It is recommended to use the Dos32 or Win32 version.  Although the Dos16
version is able to edit very big files, it quickly runs out of memory when
making big changes.  Disabling undo helps: ":set ul=-1".  The screen updating
of the Dos16 version is the fastest of the three on DOS or Windows 95; on
Windows NT, the Win32 version is just as fast.

								*DPMI*
For the Dos32 version, you may need a DPMI driver when running in MS-DOS.  If
you are running Windows or installed a clever memory manager, it will probably
work already.  If you get the message "No DPMI", you need to install a DPMI
driver.  Such a driver is included with the executable in CSDPMI4B.ZIP.  Run
"cwsdpmi" just before starting Vim each time.  Or you might want to include
"cwsdpmi -p" in your autoexec.bat to make it resident.  The latest version of
"CSDPMI*.ZIP" can be obtained from: "ftp.neosoft.com:pub/users/s/sandmann".

							*minimal-features*
The 16 bit DOS version has been compiled with minimal features.  Check the
|+feature-list| which ones are included (marked with a "T").
You can include more features by editing feature.h and recompiling.

==============================================================================
2. Known problems					*msdos-problems*

When using smartdrive (MS-DOS 6.x) with write-behind caching, it is possible
that Vim will try to create a swap file on a read-only file system (e.g.
write protected floppy).  You will then be given the message >
	A serious disk error has occurred .., Retry (r)?
There is nothing you can do but unprotect the floppy or switch off the
computer.  Even CTRL-ALT-DEL will not get you out of this.  This is really a
problem of smartdrive, not Vim.  Smartdrive works fine otherwise.  If this
bothers you, don't use the write-behind caching.

Vim can't read swap files that have been opened already, unless the "share"
command has been used.  If you see stray warnings for existing swap files,
include the "share" command in your config.sys or autoexec.bat (see your MSDOS
documentation).

The Dos16 version can only have about 10 files open (in a window or hidden) at
one time.  With more files you will get error messages when trying to read or
write a file, and for filter commands.  Or Vim runs out of memory, and random
problems may result.

The Dos32 version cannot have an unlimited number of files open at any one
time.  The limit depends on the setting of FILES in your CONFIG.SYS.  This
defaults to 15; if you need to edit a lot of files, you should increase this.
If you do not set FILES high enough, you can get strange errors, and shell
commands may cause a crash!

The Dos32 version can work with long file names.  When doing file name
completion, matches for the short file name will also be found.  But this will
result in the corresponding long file name.  For example, if you have the long
file name "this_is_a_test" with the short file name "this_i~1", the command
":e *1" will start editing "this_is_a_test".

When using the Dos32 version and you run into problems with DPMI support,
check if there is a program in your config.sys that eats resources.  One
program known to cause this problem is "netx", which says "NetWare v. 3.26
Workstation shell".  Replace it with version 3.32 to fix the problem.

The Dos32 version will parse its arguments to handle quotation.  This is good
to edit a file with spaces in its name, for example: >
	vim "program files\accessories\ppp.scp"
A side effect is that single quotes are removed.  Insert a backslash to avoid
that.  For example, to edit the file "fi'le.txt": >
	vim fi\'le.txt

==============================================================================
3. Long file names					*msdos-longfname*

If the Dos32 version is run on Windows 95, it can use long file names.  It
will work by default.  If you want to disable this, use this setting:
	set LFN=N
You can put this in your autoexec.bat file.

Note: If you have installed DJGPP on your machine, you probably have a
"djgpp.env" file, which contains "LFN=n".  You need to use "LFN=Y" to switch
on using long file names then.

==============================================================================
4. Termcap codes					*msdos-termcap*

If you want to use another output method (e.g., when using a terminal on a COM
port), set the terminal name to "pcansi".  You can change the termcap options
when needed (see |terminal-options|).  Note that the
normal IBM ansi.sys does not support all the codes of the builtin pcansi
terminal.  If you use ansi.sys, you will need to delete the termcap entries
t_al and t_dl with >
   :set t_al= t_dl=
Otherwise, the screen will not be updated correctly.  It is better to use
nansi.sys, nnansi.sys, or the like instead of ansi.sys.

If you want to use Vim on a terminal connected to a COM: port, reset the
'bioskey' option.  Otherwise the commands will be read from the PC keyboard.
CTRL-C and CTRL-P may not work correctly with 'bioskey' reset.

==============================================================================
5. Shifted arrow keys					*msdos-arrows*

Use CTRL-arrow-left and CTRL-arrow-right instead of SHIFT-arrow-left and
SHIFT-arrow-right.  The arrow-up and arrow-down cannot be used with SHIFT or
CTRL.

==============================================================================
6. Filename extensions				*msdos-fname-extensions*

MS-DOS allows for only one file name extension.  Therefore, when appending an
extension, the '.' in the original file name is replaced with a '_', the name
is truncated to 8 characters, and the new extension (e.g., ".swp") is
appended.  Two examples: "test.c" becomes "test_c.bak", "thisisat.est"
becomes "thisisat.bak".  To reduce these problems, the default for
'backupext' is "~" instead of ".bak".  The backup file for "thisisat.est"
then becomes "thisisat.es~".  The 'shortname' option is not available,
because it would always be set.

==============================================================================
7. Memory usage and limitations			*msdos-limitations*

A swap file is used to store most of the text.  You should be able to edit
very large files.  However, memory is used for undo and other things.  If you
delete a lot of text, you can still run out of memory in the Dos16 version.

If Vim gives an "Out of memory" warning, you should stop editing.  The result
of further editing actions is unpredictable.  Setting 'undolevels' to 0 saves
some memory.  Running the maze macros on a big maze is guaranteed to run out
of memory, because each change is remembered for undo.  In this case set
'undolevels' to a negative number.  This will switch off undo completely.

						*msdos-clipboard-limits*
In the Dos32 version, extended memory is used to avoid these problems.
However, if you are using the clipboard, you can still run into memory
limitations because the Windows clipboard can only communicate with Vim using
Dos memory.  This means that the largest amount of text that can be sent to
or received from the Windows clipboard is limited by how much free Dos memory
is available on your system.

You can usually maximize the amount of available Dos memory by adding the
following lines to Dos's "config.sys" file: >

	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\himem.sys
	DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\emm386.exe RAM

Modifying config.sys in this way will also help to make more memory available
for the Dos16 version, if you are using that.

In the Dos16 version the line length is limited to about 32000 characters.
When reading a file the lines are automatically split.  But editing a line
in such a way that it becomes too long may give unexpected results.

==============================================================================
8. Symbolically linked files			*msdos-linked-files*

When using Vim to edit a symbolically linked file on a unix NFS file server,
you may run into problems.  When writing the file, Vim does not "write
through" the symlink.  Instead, it deletes the symbolic link and creates a new
file in its place.

On Unix, Vim is prepared for links (symbolic or hard).  A backup copy of the
original file is made and then the original file is overwritten.  This assures
that all properties of the file remain the same.  On non-Unix systems, the
original file is renamed and a new file is written.  Only the protection bits
are set like the original file.  However, this doesn't work properly when
working on an NFS-mounted file system where links and other things exist.  The
only way to fix this in the current version is not making a backup file, by
":set nobackup nowritebackup"	|'writebackup'|

A similar problem occurs when mounting a Unix filesystem through Samba or a
similar system.  When Vim creates a new file it will get the default user ID
for the mounted file system.  This may be different from the original user ID.
To avoid this set the 'backupcopy' option to "yes".

==============================================================================
9. Copy/paste in a dos box			*msdos-copy-paste*

					*E450* *E451* *E452* *E453* *E454*
The 32 bit version can copy/paste from/to the Windows clipboard directly.  Use
the "* register.  Large amounts of text can be copied this way, but it must be
possible to allocate memory for it, see |msdos-clipboard-limits|.  When moving
text from one Vim to another, the type of the selection
(characterwise/linewise/blockwise) is passed on.

In other versions, the following can be used.

(posted to comp.editors by John Velman <velman@igate1.hac.com>)

How to copy/paste text from/to vim in a dos box:

1) To get VIM to run in a window, instead of full screen, press alt+enter.
   This toggles back and forth between full screen and a dos window.
   NOTE: In Windows 95 you must have the property "Fast Pasting" unchecked!
   In the properties dialog box for the MS-DOS window, go to "MS-DOS
   Prompt/Misc/Fast pasting" and make sure that it is NOT checked.
   To make this permanent, change the properties for
   "\windows\system\conagent.exe" (from Philip Nelson, unverified).

2) To paste something _into_ Vim, put Vim in insert mode.

3) Put the text you want to paste on the windows clipboard.

4) Click the control box in the upper left of the Vim window.  (This looks
   like a big minus sign.)  If you don't want to use the mouse, you can get
   this with alt+spacebar.
5) On the resulting dropdown menu choose "Edit".
6) On the child dropdown menu choose "Paste".

To copy something from the Vim window to the clipboard,

1) Select the control box to get the control drop down menu.
2) Select "Edit".
3) Select "Mark".
4) Using either the keys or the mouse, select the part of the Vim window that
   you want to copy.  To use the keys, use the arrow keys, and hold down shift
   to extend the selection.
5) When you've completed your selection, press 'enter'.  The selection
   is now in the windows clipboard.  By the way, this can be any
   rectangular selection, for example columns 4-25 in rows 7-10.  It can
   include anything in the VIM window: the output of a :!dir, for
   example.

							*os2* *OS2* *OS/2*
This file contains the particularities for the OS/2 version of Vim.

At present there is no native PM version of the GUI version of Vim: The OS/2
version is a console application.  However, there is now a Win32s-compatible
GUI version, which should be usable by owners of Warp 4 (which supports
Win32s) in a Win-OS/2 session.  The notes in this file refer to the native
console version.


NOTE

This OS/2 port works well for me and a couple of other OS/2 users; however,
since I haven't had much feedback, that either means no (OS/2-specific) bugs
exist (besides the ones mentioned below), or no one has yet created a
situation in which any bugs are apparent.  File I/O in Dos and Unix mode,
binary mode, and FAT handling all seem to work well, which would seem to be
the most likely places for trouble.

A known problem is that files opened by Vim are inherited by other programs
that are started via a shell escape from within Vim.  This specifically means
that Vim won't be able to remove the swap file(s) associated with buffers open
at the time the other program was started, until the other program is stopped.
At that time, the swap file may be removed, but if Vim could not do that the
first time, it won't be removed at all.  You'll get warnings that some other
Vim session may be editing the file when you start Vim up again on that file.
This can be reproduced with ":!start epm".  Now quit Vim, and start Vim again
with the file that was in the buffer at the time epm was started.  I'm working
on this!

A second problem is that Vim doesn't understand the situation when using it
when accessing the OS/2 system via the network, e.g. using telnet from a Unix
system, and then starting Vim.  The problem seems to be that OS/2 =sometimes=
recognizes function / cursor keys, and tries to convert those to the
corresponding OS/2 codes generated by the "normal" PC keyboard.  I've been
testing a workaround (mapping the OS/2 codes to the correct functions), but so
far I can't say anything conclusive (this is on Warp 3, by the way).  In the
meantime any help will be appreciated.


PREREQUISITES

To run Vim, you need the emx runtime environment (at least rev. 0.9b).  This
is generally available as (ask Archie about it):

    emxrt.zip     emx runtime package

I've included a copy of emx.dll, which should be copied to one of the
directories listed in your LIBPATH.  Emx is GPL'ed, but the emx.dll library is
not (read COPYING.EMX to find out what that means to you).

This emx.dll is from the emxfix04.zip package, which unfortunately has a bug,
eh, I mean a POSIX feature, in select().  Versions of Vim before 3.27 will
appear to hang when starting (actually, while processing vimrc).  Hit <Enter> a
couple of times until Vim starts working if this happens.  Next, get an up to
date version of Vim!


HELP AND VIMRC FILE

If you unpack the archive that Vim came in and run Vim directly from where it
was unpacked, Vim should be able to find the runtime files and your .vimrc
without any settings.

If you put the runtime files separately from the binary, the VIM environment
variable is used to find the location of the help files and the system .vimrc.
Place an entry such as this in CONFIG.SYS: >

  SET VIM=c:/local/lib/vim

Put your .vimrc and your other Vim files in this directory.  Copy the runtime
directory to this directory.  Each version of Vim has its own runtime
directory.  It will be called something like "c:/local/lib/vim/vim54".  Thus
you get a tree of Vim files like this:
	c:/local/lib/vim/.vimrc
	c:/local/lib/vim/vim54/filetype.vim
	c:/local/lib/vim/vim54/doc/help.txt
	etc.

Note: .vimrc may also be called _vimrc to accommodate those who have chosen to
install OS/2 on a FAT file system.  Vim first tries to find .vimrc and if that
fails, looks for _vimrc in the same place.  The existence of a .vimrc or
_vimrc file influences the 'compatible' options, which can have unexpected side
effects.  See |'compatible'|.

If you're using network drives with OS/2, then you can install Vim on a
network drive (including .vimrc; this is then called the "system" vimrc file),
and then use a personal copy of .vimrc (the "user" vimrc file).  This should be
located in a directory indicated by the HOME environment variable.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN FILE NAMES

This HOME environment variable is also used when using ~ in file names, so
":e ~/textfile" will edit the file "textfile" in the directory referred to by
HOME.  Additionally you can use other environment variables in file names, as
in ":n $SRC/*.c".

The HOME environment variable is also used to locate the .viminfo file
(see |viminfo-file|).  There is no support yet for .viminfo on FAT file
systems yet, sorry.  You could try the -i startup flag (as in "vim -i
$HOME/_viminfo") however.

If the HOME environment variable is not set, the value "C:/" is used as a
default.


BACKSLASHES

Using slashes ('/') and backslashes ('\') can be a bit of a problem (see
|dos-backslash| for more explanation), but in almost all cases Vim does "The
Right Thing".  Vim itself uses backslashes in file names, but will happily
accept forward slashes if they are entered (in fact, sometimes that works
better!).


TEMP FILES

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in the first directory in the next
list that exists and where a file can be created:
	$TMP
	$TEMP
	C:\TMP
	C:\TEMP
	current directory


TERMINAL SETTING

							*os2ansi*
Use "os2ansi" as the TERM environment variable (or don't set it at all, as the
default is the correct value).  You can set term to os2ansi in the .vimrc, in
case you need TERM to be a different value for other applications.  The
problem is that OS/2 ANSI emulation is quite limited (it doesn't have insert /
delete line, for example).

If you want to use a different value for TERM (because of other programs, for
example), make sure that the termcap entry for that TERM value has the
appropriate key mappings.  The termcap.dat distributed with emx does not always
have them.  Here are some suitable values to add to the termcap entry of your
choice; these allow the cursor keys and the named function keys (such as
pagedown) to work.

	:kD=\316S:kI=\316R:kN=\316Q:kP=\316I:kh=\316G:@7=\316O:\

43 LINE WINDOW

A suggestion from Steven Tryon, on how to run Vim in a bigger window:

When I call Vim from an OS/2 WPS application such as PMMail it comes up
in the default 25-line mode.  To get a more useful window size I make
my external editor "vimbig.cmd" which in turn calls "vimbig2.cmd".
Brute force and awkwardness, perhaps, but it works.

vimbig.cmd: >
   @echo off
   start "Vi Improved" /f vimbig2.cmd %1 %2 %3 %4

vimbig2.cmd: >
   @echo off
   mode 80,43
   vim.exe %1 %2 %3 %4
   exit
<

CLIPBOARD ACCESS (provided by Alexander Wagner)

Vim for OS/2 has no direct access to the system clipboard.  To enable access
anyway you need an additional tool which gives you access to the clipboard
from within a vio application.  The freeware package clipbrd.zip by Stefan
Gruendel can be used for this purpose.  You might download the package
including precompiled binaries and all sources from:
	http://www.os2site.com/sw/util/clipboard/index.html
	http://download.uni-hd.de/ftp/pub/os2/pmtools/

Installation of this package is straight forward: just put the two executables
that come with this package into a directory within your PATH for Vim should
be able to call them from whatever directory you are working.

To copy text from the clipboard to your Vim session you can use the :r
command.  Simply call clipbrd.exe from within Vim in the following way: >

	:r !clipbrd -r

To copy text from Vim to the system clipboard just mark the text in the usual
vim-manner and call: >

	:!clipbrd -w

which will write your selection right into OS/2's clipboard.

For ease of use you might want to add some maps for these commands.  E.g. to
use F11 to paste the clipboard into Vim and F12 to copy selected text to the
clipboard you would use: >

	if has("os2")
	  imap <F11>     <ESC>:r !clipbrd -r<CR>i
	  vmap <F12>     :!clipbrd -w<cr>
	else
	  imap <F11>     <ESC>"*p<CR>i
	  vmap <F12>     "*y
	endif

This will ensure that only on OS/2 clipbrd is called whereas on other
platforms vims build in mechanism is used.  (To enable this functions on every
load of Vim place the above lines in your .vimrc.)

							*QNX* *qnx*

1. General			|qnx-general|
2. Compiling Vim		|qnx-compiling|
3. Terminal support		|qnx-terminal|
4. Photon GUI			|photon-gui|
5. Photon fonts			|photon-fonts|
6. Bugs & things To Do

==============================================================================

1. General						*qnx-general*

Vim on QNX behaves much like other unix versions. |os_unix.txt|


2. Compiling Vim					*qnx-compiling*

Vim can be compiled using the standard configure/make approach.  If you want to
compile for X11, pass the --with-x option to configure.  Otherwise, running
./configure without any arguments or passing --enable-gui=photon, will compile
vim with the Photon gui support.  Run ./configure --help , to find out other
features you can enable/disable.


3. Terminal support					*qnx-terminal*

Vim has support for the mouse and clipboard in a pterm, if those options
are compiled in, which they are normally.

The options that affect mouse support are |'mouse'| and |'ttymouse'|.  When
using the mouse, only simple left and right mouse clicking/dragging is
supported.  If you hold down shift, ctrl, or alt while using the mouse, pterm
will handle the mouse itself.  It will make a selection, separate from what
vim's doing.

When the mouse is in use, you can press Alt-RightMouse to open the pterm menu.
To turn the mouse off in vim, set the mouse option to nothing, set mouse=


4. Photon GUI						*photon-gui*

To start the gui for vim, you need to run either gvim or vim -g, otherwise
the terminal version will run.  For more info - |gui-x11-start|

Supported features:
	:browse command					|:browse|
	:confirm command				|:confirm|
	Cursor blinking					|'guicursor'|
	Menus, popup menus and menu priorities		|:menu|
							|popup-menu|
							|menu-priority|
	Toolbar						|gui-toolbar|
							|'toolbar'|
	Font selector (:set guifont=*)			|photon-fonts|
	Mouse focus					|'mousefocus'|
	Mouse hide					|'mousehide'|
	Mouse cursor shapes				|'mouseshape'|
	Clipboard					|gui-clipboard|

Unfinished features:
	Various international support, such as Farsi & Hebrew support,
	different encodings, etc.

	This help file

Unsupported features:
	Find & Replace window				|:promptfind|
	Tearoff menus

	Other things which I can't think of so I can't list them


5. Fonts						*photon-fonts*

You set fonts in the gui with the guifont option >
	:set guifont=Lucida\ Terminal
<
The font must be a monospace font, and any spaces in the font name must be
escaped with a '\'.  The default font used is PC Terminal, size 8.  Using
'*' as the font name will open a standard Photon font selector where you can
select a font.

Following the name, you can include optional settings to control the size and
style of the font, each setting separated by a ':'.  Not all fonts support the
various styles.

The options are,
    s{size}	Set the size of the font to {size}
    b		Bold style
    a		Use antialiasing
    i		Italic style

Examples:

Set the font to monospace size 10 with antialiasing >
	:set guifont=monospace:s10:a
<
Set the font to Courier size 12, with bold and italics >
	:set guifont=Courier:s12:b:i
<
Select a font with the requester >
	:set guifont=*
<


6. Bugs & things To Do

Known problems:
	- Vim hangs sometimes when running an external program.  Workaround:
	  put this line in your |vimrc| file: >
		set noguipty

Bugs:
	- Still a slight problem with menu highlighting.
	- When using phditto/phinows/etc., if you are using a font that
	  doesn't support the bold attribute, when vim attempts to draw
	  bold text it will be all messed up.
	- The cursor can sometimes be hard to see.
	- A number of minor problems that can fixed. :)

Todo:
	- Improve multi-language support.
	- Options for setting the fonts used in the menu and toolbar.
	- Find & Replace dialog.
	- The clientserver features.
	- Maybe tearoff menus.

	- Replace usage of fork() with spawn() when launching external
	  programs.

For compiling Vim on Unix see "INSTALL" and "Makefile" in the src directory.

The default help file name is "/usr/local/lib/vim/help.txt"
The files "$HOME/.vimrc" and "$HOME/.exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and
"s:.exrc".  Additionally "/usr/local/etc/vimrc" is used first.
If "/usr/local/share" exists it is used instead of "/usr/local/lib".

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in "/tmp".  If you want to place them
somewhere else, set the environment variable $TMPDIR to the directory you
prefer.

With wildcard expansion you can use '~' (home directory) and '$'
(environment variable).

							*fork* *spoon*
For executing external commands fork()/exec() is used when possible, otherwise
system() is used, which is a bit slower.  The output of ":version" includes
|+fork| when fork()/exec() is used, |+system()| when system() is used.  This
can be changed at compile time.
(For forking of the GUI version see |gui-fork|.)

Because terminal updating under Unix is often slow (e.g. serial line
terminal, shell window in suntools), the 'showcmd' and 'ruler' options
are default off.  If you have a fast terminal, try setting them on.  You might
also want to set 'ttyfast'.

When using Vim in an xterm the mouse clicks can be used by Vim by setting
'mouse' to "a".  If there is access to an X-server gui style copy/paste will
be used and visual feedback will be provided while dragging with the mouse.
If you then still want the xterm copy/paste with the mouse, press the shift
key when using the mouse.  See |mouse-using|.  Visual feedback while dragging
can also be achieved via the 'ttymouse' option if your xterm is new enough.

							*terminal-colors*
To use colors in Vim you can use the following example (if your terminal
supports colors, but "T_Co" is empty or zero): >
   :set t_me=^[[0;1;36m     " normal mode (undoes t_mr and t_md)
   :set t_mr=^[[0;1;33;44m  " reverse (invert) mode
   :set t_md=^[[1;33;41m    " bold mode
   :set t_se=^[[1;36;40m    " standout end
   :set t_so=^[[1;32;45m    " standout mode
   :set t_ue=^[[0;1;36m     " underline end
   :set t_us=^[[1;32m       " underline mode start
[the ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to enter it]

For real color terminals the ":highlight" command can be used.

The file "tools/vim132" is a shell script that can be used to put Vim in 132
column mode on a vt100 and lookalikes.

==============================================================================

1. Getting started					*vms-started*

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a Vi-compatible text editor that runs on nearly every
operating system known to humanity.  Now use Vim on OpenVMS too, in character
or X/Motif environment.  It is fully featured and absolutely compatible with
Vim on other operating systems.

==============================================================================

2. Download files					*vms-download*

You can download the Vim source code by ftp from the official Vim site:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/
Or use one of the mirrors:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS

You can download precompiled executables from:
	http://www.polarhome.com/vim/
	ftp://ftp.polarhome.com/pub/vim/

To use the precompiled binary version, you need one of these archives:

  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gui.zip       IA64 GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gtk.zip       IA64 GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-term.zip      IA64 console executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gui.zip	Alpha GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gtk.zip	Alpha GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-term.zip       Alpha console executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-gui.zip	VAX GUI executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-term.zip       VAX console executables

and of course (optional)
  vim-XX-runtime.zip		runtime files

The binary archives contain: vim.exe, ctags.exe, xxd.exe files.

For GTK executables you will need GTKLIB that is available for
Alpha and IA64 platform.

==============================================================================

3. Compiling						*vms-compiling*

See the file [.SRC]INSTALLVMS.TXT.

==============================================================================

4. Problems						*vms-problems*

The code has been tested under Open VMS 6.2 - 8.2 on Alpha, VAX and IA64
platforms with the DEC C compiler.  It should work without big problems.
If your system does not have some include libraries you can tune up in
OS_VMS_CONF.H file.

If you decided to build Vim with +perl, +python, etc. options, first you need
to download OpenVMS distributions of Perl and Python.  Build and deploy the
libraries and change adequate lines in MAKE_VMS.MMS file.  There should not be
a problem from Vim side.

Also GTK, XPM library paths should be configured in MAKE_VMS.MMS

Note: Under VAX it should work with the DEC C compiler without problems.  The
VAX C compiler is not fully ANSI C compatible in pre-processor directives
semantics, therefore you have to use a converter program that will do the lion
part of the job.  For detailed instructions read file INSTALLvms.txt

MMS_VIM.EXE is build together with VIM.EXE, but for XXD.EXE you should
change to a subdirectory and build it separately.

CTAGS is not part of the Vim source distribution anymore, however the OpenVMS
specific source might contain CTAGS source files as described above.
You can find more information about CTAGS on VMS at
http://www.polarhome.com/ctags/

Advanced users may try some acrobatics in FEATURE.H file as well.

It is possible to compile with +xfontset +xim options too, but then you have
to set up GUI fonts etc. correctly.  See :help xim from Vim command prompt.

You may want to use GUI with GTK icons, then you have to download and install
GTK for OpenVMS or at least runtime shareable images - LIBGTK from
polarhome.com

For more advanced questions, please send your problem to Vim on VMS mailing
list <vim-vms@polarhome.com>
More about the vim-vms list can be found at:
http://www.polarhome.com/mailman/listinfo/vim-vms

==============================================================================

5. Deploy						*vms-deploy*

Vim uses a special directory structure to hold the document and runtime files:

   vim (or wherever)
    |- tmp
    |- vim57
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim62
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim64
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    vimrc    (system rc files)
    gvimrc

Use: >

	define/nolog VIM	device:[path.vim]
	define/nolog VIMRUNTIME device:[path.vim.vim60]
	define/nolog TMP	device:[path.tmp]

To get vim.exe to find its document, filetype, and syntax files, and to
specify a directory where temporary files will be located.  Copy the "runtime"
subdirectory of the Vim distribution to vimruntime.

Logicals $VIMRUNTIME and $TMP are optional.

If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, Vim will guess and try to set up automatically.
Read more about it at :help runtime

If $TMP is not set, you will not be able to use some functions as CTAGS,
XXD, printing etc. that use temporary directory for normal operation.
The $TMP directory should be readable and writable by the user(s).
The easiest way to set up $TMP is to define a logical: >

	define/nolog TMP SYS$SCRATCH
or as: >
	define/nolog TMP SYS$LOGIN

==============================================================================

6. Practical usage					*vms-usage*

Usually, you want to run just one version of Vim on your system, therefore
it is enough to dedicate one directory for Vim.
Copy the whole Vim runtime directory structure to the deployment position.
Add the following lines to your LOGIN.COM (in SYS$LOGIN directory).
Set up the logical $VIM as: >

	$ define VIM device:<path>

Set up some symbols: >

	$ ! vi starts Vim in chr. mode.
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE

	$ !gvi starts Vim in GUI mode.
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g

Please, check the notes for customization and configuration of symbols.

You may want to create .vimrc and .gvimrc files in your home directory
(SYS$LOGIN) to overwrite default settings.

The easiest way is just rename example files.  You may leave the menu file
(MENU.VIM) and files vimrc and gvimrc in the original $VIM directory.  It will
be the default setup for all users, and for users it is enough to just have
their own additions or resetting in their home directory in files .vimrc and
.gvimrc.  It should work without problems.

Note: Remember, system rc files (default for all users) don't have a leading
".".  So, system rc files are: >

	$VIM:vimrc
	$VIM:gvimrc
	$VIM:menu.vim

and user customized rc files are: >

	sys$login:.vimrc
	sys$login:.gvimrc

You can check that everything is at the right place with the :version command.

Example LOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM]
	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.223/trans=tcpip

Note: This set-up should be enough, if you are working on a standalone server or
clustered environment, but if you want to use Vim as an internode editor in
DECNET environment, it will satisfy as well.
You just have to define the "whole" path: >

	$ define VIM "<server_name>[""user password""]::device:<path>"
	$ vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"

For example: >

	$ define VIM "PLUTO::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]"
	$ define VIM "PLUTO""ZAY mypass""::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]" ! if passwd required

You can also use the $VIMRUNTIME logical to point to the proper version of Vim
if you have installed more versions at the same time.  If $VIMRUNTIME is not
defined Vim will borrow its value from the $VIM logical.  You can find more
information about the $VIMRUNTIME logical by typing :help runtime as a Vim
command.

System administrators might want to set up a system wide Vim installation,
then add to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.COM >

	$ define/nolog/sys VIM device:<path>
	$ define/nolog/sys TMP SYS$SCRATCH

And to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGIN.COM >

	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


It will set up a normal Vim work environment for every user on the system.

IMPORTANT: Vim on OpenVMS (and on other case insensitive system) command line
parameters are assumed to be lowercase. In order to indicate that a command
line parameter is uppercase "/" sign must be used.

Examples:
  >
	vim -R  filename  ! means: -r List swap files and exit
	vim -/r filename  ! means: -R Readonly mode (like "view")
	vim -u	<vimrc>   ! means: -u Use <vimrc> instead of any .vimrc
	vim -/u <gvimrc>  ! means: -U Use <gvimrc> instead of any .gvimrc

==============================================================================

7. GUI mode questions					*vms-gui*

OpenVMS is a real mainframe OS, therefore even if it has a GUI console, most
of the users do not use a native X/Window environment during normal operation.
It is not possible to start Vim in GUI mode "just like that".  But anyhow it
is not too complicated either.

First of all: you will need an executable that is built with the GUI enabled.

Second: you need to have installed DECW/Motif on your VMS server, otherwise
you will get errors that some shareable libraries are missing.

Third: If you choose to run Vim with extra features such as GUI/GTK then you
need a GTK installation too or at least a GTK runtime environment (LIBGTK
can be downloaded from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/).

1) If you are working on the VMS X/Motif console:
   Start Vim with the command: >

	$ mc device:<path>VIM.EXE -g
<
   or type :gui as a command to the Vim command prompt.  For more info :help
   gui

2) If you are working on some other X/Window environment like Unix or a remote
   X VMS console.  Set up display to your host with: >

	$ set disp/create/node=<your IP address>/trans=<transport-name>
<
   and start Vim as in point 1.  You can find more help in VMS documentation or
   type: help set disp in VMS prompt.
   Examples: >

	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159		 ! default trans is DECnet
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=tcpip ! TCP/IP network
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=local ! display on the same node

Note: you should define just one of these.
For more information type $help set disp in VMS prompt.

3) Another elegant solution is XDM if you have installed on OpenVMS box.
   It is possible to work from XDM client as from GUI console.

4) If you are working on MS-Windows or some other non X/Window environment
   you need to set up one X server and run Vim as in point 2.
   For MS-Windows there are available free X servers as MIX, Omni X etc.,
   as well as excellent commercial products as eXcursion or ReflectionX with
   built-in DEC support.

Please note, that executables without GUI are slightly faster during startup
than with enabled GUI in character mode. Therefore, if you do not use GUI
features, it is worth to choose non GUI executables.

8.1 Backspace/delete

There are backspace/delete key inconsistencies with VMS.
:fixdel doesn't do the trick, but the solution is: >

	:inoremap ^? ^H		" for terminal mode
	:inoremap <Del> ^H	" for gui mode

Read more in ch: 8.6 (Terminal problems).
(Bruce Hunsaker <BNHunsaker@chq.byu.edu> Vim 5.3)


8.2 Filters

Vim supports filters, i.e., if you have a sort program that can handle
input/output redirection like Unix (<infile >outfile), you could use >

	:map \s 0!'aqsort<CR>

(Charles E. Campbell, Jr. <cec@gryphon.gsfc.nasa.gov> Vim 5.4)


8.3 VMS file version numbers

Vim is saving files into a new file with the next higher file version
number, try these settings. >

	:set nobackup	     " does not create *.*_ backup files
	:set nowritebackup   " does not have any purpose on VMS.  It's the
			     " default.

Recovery is working perfectly as well from the default swap file.
Read more with :help swapfile

(Claude Marinier <ClaudeMarinier@xwavesolutions.com> Vim 5.5, Zoltan Arpadffy
Vim 5.6)


8.4 Directory conversion

Vim will internally convert any unix-style paths and even mixed unix/VMS
paths into VMS style paths.  Some typical conversions resemble:

	/abc/def/ghi		-> abc:[def]ghi.
	/abc/def/ghi.j		-> abc:[def]ghi.j
	/abc/def/ghi.j;2	-> abc:[def]ghi.j;2
	/abc/def/ghi/jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	abc:[def.ghi]jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	  ./			-> current directory
	  ../			-> relative parent directory
	  [.def.ghi]		-> relative child directory
	   ./def/ghi		-> relative child directory

Note: You may use <,> brackets as well (device:<path>file.ext;version) as
rf10:<user.zay.work>test.c;1

(David Elins <delins@foliage.com>, Jerome Lauret
<JLAURET@mail.chem.sunysb.edu> Vim 5.6)


8.5 Remote host invocation

It is possible to use Vim as an internode editor.
1. Edit some file from remote node: >

	vi "<server>""username passwd""::<device>:<path><filename>;<version>"

Example: >
	vi "pluto""zay passwd""::RF10:<USER.ZAY.WORK>TEST.C;1"

Note: syntax is very important, otherwise VMS will recognize more parameters
instead of one (resulting with: file not found)

2.  Set up Vim as your internode editor.  If Vim is not installed on your
host, just set up your IP address, the full Vim path including the server name
and run the command procedure below: >

	$ if (p1 .eqs. "") .OR. (p2 .eqs. "") then goto usage
	$ set disp/create/node=<your_IP_here>/trans=tcpip
	$ define "VIM "<vim_server>""''p1' ''p2'""::<device>:<vim_path>"
	$  vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"
	$ gv*im :== "spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g"
	$ goto end
	$ usage:
	$ write sys$output " Please enter username and password as a parameter."
	$ write sys$output " Example: @SETVIM.COM username passwd"
	$ end:

Note: Never use it in a clustered environment (you do not need it), loading
could be very-very slow, but even faster than a local Emacs. :-)

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.6 Terminal problems

If your terminal name is not known to Vim and it is trying to find the default
one you will get the following message during start-up:
---
Terminal entry not found in termcap
'unknown-terminal' not known.  Available built-in terminals are:
    builtin_gui
    builtin_riscos
    builtin_amiga
    builtin_beos-ansi
    builtin_ansi
    builtin_vt320
    builtin_vt52
    builtin_pcansi
    builtin_win32
    builtin_xterm
    builtin_iris-ansi
    builtin_debug
    builtin_dumb
defaulting to 'vt320'
---
The solution is to define the default terminal name: >

	$ ! unknown terminal name.  Let us use vt320 or ansi instead.
	$ ! Note: it's case sensitive
	$ define term "vt320"

Terminals from VT100 to VT320 (as V300, VT220, VT200) do not need any extra
keyboard mappings.  They should work perfectly as they are, including arrows,
Ins, Del buttons etc., except Backspace in GUI mode.  To solve it, add to
.gvimrc: >

	inoremap <Del> <BS>

Vim will also recognize that they are fast terminals.

If you have some annoying line jumping on the screen between windows add to
your .vimrc file: >

	set ttyfast	" set fast terminal

Note: if you're using Vim on remote host or through a very slow connection, it's
recommended to avoid the fast terminal option with: >

	set nottyfast   " set terminal to slow mode

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.7 Hex-editing and other external tools

A very important difference between OpenVMS and other systems is that VMS uses
special commands to execute executables: >

	RUN <path>filename
	MCR <path>filename <parameters>

OpenVMS users always have to be aware that the Vim command :! "just" drop them
to DCL prompt.  This feature is possible to use without any problem with all
DCL commands, but if we want to execute some programs such as XXD, CTAGS, JTAGS,
etc.  we're running into trouble if we follow the Vim documentation (see: help
xxd).

Solution: Execute with the MC command and add the full path to the executable.
Example: Instead of :%!xxd command use: >

	:%!mc vim:xxd

... or in general: >
	:!mc <path>filename <parameters>

Note: You can use XXD and CTAGS from GUI menu.

To customize ctags it is possible to define the logical $CTAGS with standard
parameters as: >

	define/nolog CTAGS "--totals -o sys$login:tags"

For additional information, please read :help tagsearch and CTAGS
documentation at http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6-70)


8.8 Sourcing vimrc and gvimrc

If you want to use your .vimrc and .gvimrc from other platforms (e.g. Windows)
you can get in trouble if you ftp that file(s): VMS has different end-of-line
indication.
The symptom is that Vim is not sourcing your .vimrc/.gvimrc, even if you say:
>
	:so sys$login:.vimrc

One trick is to compress (e.g. zip) the files on the other platform and
uncompress it on VMS; if you have the same symptom, try to create the files
with copy-paste (for this you need both op. systems reachable from one
machine, e.g. an Xterm on Windows or telnet to Windows from VMS).

(Sandor Kopanyi, <sandor.kopanyi@mailbox.hu> Vim 6.0a)


8.9 Printing from Vim

To be able to print from Vim (running in GUI mode) under VMS you have to set
up $TMP logical which should point to some temporary directory and logical
SYS$PRINT to your default print queue.
Example: >

	$define SYS$PRINT HP5ANSI

You can print out the whole buffer or just the marked area.
More info under :help hardcopy

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.0c)


8.10 Setting up the symbols

When I use GVIM this way and press CTRL-Y in the parent terminal, gvim exits.
I now use a different symbol that seems to work OK and fixes the problem.
I suggest this instead: >

	$ GV*IM:==SPAWN/NOWAIT/INPUT=NLA0: MCR VIM:VIM.EXE -G -GEOMETRY 80X40

The /INPUT=NLA0: separates the standard input of the gvim process from the
parent terminal, to block signals from the parent window.
Without the -GEOMETRY, the GVIM window size will be minimal and the menu
will be confused after a window-resize.

(Carlo Mekenkamp, Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.0ac)


8.11 diff and other GNU programs

From 6.0 diff functionality has been implemented, but OpenVMS does not use
GNU/Unix like diff therefore built in diff does not work.
There is a simple solution to solve this anomaly.  Install a Unix like diff
and Vim will work perfectly in diff mode too.  You just have to redefine your
diff program as: >

	define /nolog diff <GNU_PATH>diff.exe

Another, more sophisticated solution is described below (8.12 diff-mode)
There are other programs such as patch, make etc that may cause the same
problems.  At www.polarhome.com is possible to download an GNU package for
Alpha and VAX boxes that is meant to solve GNU problems on OpenVMS.
(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.1)


8.12 diff-mode

Vim 6.0 and higher supports Vim diff-mode (See |new-diff-mode|, |diff-mode|
and |08.7|).  This uses the external program 'diff' and expects a Unix-like
output format from diff.  The standard VMS diff has a different output
format.  To use Vim on VMS in diff-mode, you need to:
    1 Install a Unix-like diff program, e.g. GNU diff
    2 Tell Vim to use the Unix-like diff for diff-mode.

You can download GNU diff from the VIM-VMS website, it is one of the GNU
tools in http://www.polarhome.com/vim/files/gnu_tools.zip.  I suggest to
unpack it in a separate directory "GNU" and create a logical GNU: that
points to that directory, e.g: >

   DEFINE GNU    <DISK>:[<DIRECTORY>.BIN.GNU]

You may also want to define a symbol GDIFF, to use the GNU diff from the DCL
prompt: >

   GDIFF :==     $GNU:DIFF.EXE

Now you need to tell Vim to use the new diff program.  Take the example
settings from |diff-diffexpr| and change the call to the external diff
program to the new diff on VMS.  Add this to your .vimrc file: >

     " Set up vimdiff options
       if v:version >= 600
	" Use GNU diff on VMS
	set diffexpr=MyDiff()
	function MyDiff()
	   let opt = ""
	   if &diffopt =~ "icase"
	     let opt = opt . "-i "
	   endif
	   if &diffopt =~ "iwhite"
	     let opt = opt . "-b "
	   endif
	   silent execute "!mc GNU:diff.exe -a " . opt . v:fname_in . " " .  v:fname_new .
		\  " > " . v:fname_out
	endfunction
      endif

You can now use Vim in diff-mode, e.g. to compare two files in read-only
mode: >

    $ VIM -D/R <FILE1> <FILE2>

You can also define new symbols for vimdiff, e.g.: >

    $ VIMDIFF     :== 'VIM' -D/R
    $ GVIMDIFF    :== 'GVIM' -D/R

You can now compare files in 4 ways: >

    1. VMS  diff:  $ DIFF     <FILE1> <FILE2>
    2. GNU  diff:  $ GDIFF    <FILE1> <FILE2>
    3. VIM  diff:  $ VIMDIFF  <FILE1> <FILE2>
    4. GVIM diff:  $ GVIMDIFF <FILE1> <FILE2>

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)


8.13 Allow '$' in C keywords

DEC C uses many identifiers with '$' in them.  This is not allowed in ANSI C,
and Vim recognises the '$' as the end of the identifier.  You can change this
with the 'iskeyword' option.
Add this command to your .vimrc file: >

    autocmd FileType c,cpp,cs  set iskeyword+=$

You can also create the file(s) $VIM/FTPLUGIN/C.VIM (and/or CPP.VIM and
CS.VIM) and add this command: >

	set iskeyword+=$

Now word-based commands, e.g. the '*'-search-command and the CTRL-]
tag-lookup, work on the whole identifier.  (Ctags on VMS also supports '$' in
C keywords since ctags version 5.1.)

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)

8.14 VIMTUTOR for beginners

The VIMTUTOR.COM DCL script can help Vim beginners to learn/make their first
steps with Vim on OpenVMS.  Depending of binary distribution you may start it
with: >

	@vim:vimtutor

(Thomas.R.Wyant III, Vim 6.1)

8.16 Slow start in console mode issue

As GUI/GTK Vim works equally well in console mode, many administrators
deploy those executables system wide.
Unfortunately, on a remote slow connections GUI/GTK executables behave rather
slow when user wants to run Vim just in the console mode - because of X
environment detection timeout.

Luckily, there is a simple solution for that. Administrators need to deploy
both GUI/GTK build and just console build executables, like below: >

    |- vim73
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
       vimrc    (system rc files)
       gvimrc
       gvim.exe (the renamed GUI or GTK built vim.exe)
       vim.exe  (the console only executable)

Define system symbols like below in for ex in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM73] ! where you VIM directory is
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gvi*m :== mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE
	$ ! or you can try to spawn with
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


Like this, users that do not have X environment and want to use Vim just in
console mode can avoid performance problems.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 7.2)

8.15 Common VIM directory - different architectures

In a cluster that contains nodes with different architectures like below:

$show cluster
View of Cluster from system ID 11655  node: TOR                                                                     18-AUG-2008 11:58:31
+---------------------------------+
        SYSTEMS         MEMBERS 
+-----------------------+---------
  NODE     SOFTWARE     STATUS 
+--------+--------------+---------
 TOR     VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
 TITAN2  VMS V8.3      MEMBER  
 ODIN    VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
+---------------------------------+

It is convenient to have a common VIM directory but execute different
executables.
There are several solutions for this problem:

Solution 1.  All executables in the same directory with different names
This is easily done with the following script that can be added
to the login.com or sylogin.com: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       vi*m:== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_VAX
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_AXP
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_IA64
	$ endif

Solution 2.  Different directories: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VAX_EXE] ! VAX executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.AXP_EXE] ! AXP executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.IA64_EXE] ! IA64 executables
	$ endif
        $! VIMRUNTIME must be defined in order to find runtime files
	$ define/nolog VIMRUNTIME RF10:[UTIL.VIM73]

A good example for this approach is the [GNU]gnu_tools.com script from
GNU_TOOLS.ZIP package downloadable from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/

This file documents the idiosyncrasies of the Win32 version of Vim.

The Win32 version of Vim works on Windows NT, 95, 98, ME, XP, Vista and
Windows 7.  There are both console and GUI versions.

The 32 bit version also runs on 64 bit MS-Windows systems.

There is GUI version for use in the Win32s subsystem in Windows 3.1[1].  You
can also use the 32-bit DOS version of Vim instead.  See |os_msdos.txt|.

For compiling see "src/INSTALLpc.txt".			*win32-compiling*

==============================================================================
1. Known problems				*windows95* *win32-problems*

There are a few known problems with running in a console on Windows 95.  As
far as we know, this is the same in Windows 98 and Windows ME.

Comments from somebody working at Microsoft: "Win95 console support has always
been and will always be flaky".
1.  Dead key support doesn't work.
2.  Resizing the window with ":set columns=nn lines=nn" works, but executing
    external commands MAY CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO HANG OR CRASH.
3.  Screen updating is slow, unless you change 'columns' or 'lines' to a
    non-DOS value.  But then the second problem applies!

If this bothers you, use the 32 bit MS-DOS version or the Win32 GUI version.

When doing file name completion, Vim also finds matches for the short file
name.  But Vim will still find and use the corresponding long file name.  For
example, if you have the long file name "this_is_a_test" with the short file
name "this_i~1", the command ":e *1" will start editing "this_is_a_test".

==============================================================================
2. Startup						*win32-startup*

Current directory					*win32-curdir*

If Vim is started with a single file name argument, and it has a full path
(starts with "x:\"), Vim assumes it was started from the file explorer and
will set the current directory to where that file is.  To avoid this when
typing a command to start Vim, use a forward slash instead of a backslash.
Example: >

	vim c:\text\files\foo.txt

Will change to the "C:\text\files" directory. >

	vim c:/text\files\foo.txt

Will use the current directory.


Term option						*win32-term*

The only kind of terminal type that the Win32 version of Vim understands is
"win32", which is built-in.  If you set 'term' to anything else, you will
probably get very strange behavior from Vim.  Therefore Vim does not obtain
the default value of 'term' from the environment variable "TERM".

$PATH							*win32-PATH*

The directory of the Vim executable is appended to $PATH.  This is mostly to
make "!xxd" work, as it is in the Tools menu.  And it also means that when
executable() returns 1 the executable can actually be executed.

==============================================================================
3. Restore screen contents				*win32-restore*

When 'restorescreen' is set (which is the default), Vim will restore the
original contents of the console when exiting or when executing external
commands.  If you don't want this, use ":set nors".	|'restorescreen'|

==============================================================================
4. Using the mouse					*win32-mouse*

The Win32 version of Vim supports using the mouse.  If you have a two-button
mouse, the middle button can be emulated by pressing both left and right
buttons simultaneously - but note that in the Win32 GUI, if you have the right
mouse button pop-up menu enabled (see 'mouse'), you should err on the side of
pressing the left button first.				|mouse-using|

When the mouse doesn't work, try disabling the "Quick Edit Mode" feature of
the console.

==============================================================================
5. Running under Windows 3.1				*win32-win3.1*

						*win32s* *windows-3.1*
There is a special version of Gvim that runs under Windows 3.1 and 3.11.  You
need the gvim.exe that was compiled with Visual C++ 4.1.

To run the Win32 version under Windows 3.1, you need to install Win32s.  You
might have it already from another Win32 application which you have installed.
If Vim doesn't seem to be running properly, get the latest version: 1.30c.
You can find it at:

	http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/pw1118.exe

(Microsoft moved it again, we don't know where it is now :-( ).

The reason for having two versions of gvim.exe is that the Win32s version was
compiled with VC++ 4.1.  This is the last version of VC++ that supports Win32s
programs.  VC++ 5.0 is better, so that one was used for the Win32 version.
Apart from that, there is no difference between the programs.  If you are in a
mixed environment, you can use the gvim.exe for Win32s on both.

The Win32s version works the same way as the Win32 version under 95/NT.  When
running under Win32s the following differences apply:
- You cannot use long file names, because Windows 3.1 doesn't support them!
- When executing an external command, it doesn't return an exit code.  After
  doing ":make" you have to do ":cn" yourself.

==============================================================================
6. Win32 mini FAQ					*win32-faq*

Q. Why does the Win32 version of Vim update the screen so slowly on Windows 95?
A. The support for Win32 console mode applications is very buggy in Win95.
   For some unknown reason, the screen updates very slowly when Vim is run at
   one of the standard resolutions (80x25, 80x43, or 80x50) and the 16-bit DOS
   version updates the screen much more quickly than the Win32 version.
   However, if the screen is set to some other resolution, such as by ":set
   columns=100" or ":set lines=40", screen updating becomes about as fast as
   it is with the 16-bit version.

   WARNING: Changing 'columns' may make Windows 95 crash while updating the
   window (complaints --> Microsoft).  Since this mostly works, this has not
   been disabled, but be careful with changing 'columns'.

   Changing the screen resolution makes updates faster, but it brings
   additional problems.  External commands (e.g., ":!dir") can cause Vim to
   freeze when the screen is set to a non-standard resolution, particularly
   when 'columns' is not equal to 80.  It is not possible for Vim to reliably
   set the screen resolution back to the value it had upon startup before
   running external commands, so if you change the number of 'lines' or
   'columns', be very, very careful.  In fact, Vim will not allow you to
   execute external commands when 'columns' is not equal to 80, because it is
   so likely to freeze up afterwards.

   None of the above applies on Windows NT.  Screen updates are fast, no
   matter how many 'lines' or 'columns' the window has, and external commands
   do not cause Vim to freeze.

Q. So if the Win32 version updates the screen so slowly on Windows 95 and the
   16-bit DOS version updates the screen quickly, why would I want to run the
   Win32 version?
A. Firstly, the Win32 version isn't that slow, especially when the screen is
   set to some non-standard number of 'lines' or 'columns'.  Secondly, the
   16-bit DOS version has some severe limitations: It can't do big changes and
   it doesn't know about long file names.  The Win32 version doesn't have these
   limitations and it's faster overall (the same is true for the 32-bit DJGPP
   DOS version of Vim).  The Win32 version is smarter about handling the
   screen, the mouse, and the keyboard than the DJGPP version is.

Q. And what about the 16-bit DOS version versus the Win32 version on NT?
A. There are no good reasons to run the 16-bit DOS version on NT.  The Win32
   version updates the screen just as fast as the 16-bit version does when
   running on NT.  All of the above disadvantages apply.  Finally, DOS
   applications can take a long time to start up and will run more slowly.  On
   non-Intel NT platforms, the DOS version is almost unusably slow, because it
   runs on top of an 80x86 emulator.

Q. How do I change the font?
A. In the GUI version, you can use the 'guifont' option.  Example: >
	:set guifont=Lucida_Console:h15:cDEFAULT
<  In the console version, you need to set the font of the console itself.
   You cannot do this from within Vim.

Q. When I change the size of the console window with ':set lines=xx' or
   similar, the font changes! (Win95)
A. You have the console font set to 'Auto' in Vim's (or your MS-DOS prompt's)
   properties.  This makes W95 guess (badly!) what font is best.  Set an explicit
   font instead.

Q. Why can't I paste into Vim when running Windows 95?
A. In the properties dialog box for the MS-DOS window, go to "MS-DOS
   Prompt/Misc/Fast pasting" and make sure that it is NOT checked.  You should
   also do ":set paste" in Vim to avoid unexpected effects.	|'paste'|

Q. How do I type dead keys on Windows 95, in the console version?
   (A dead key is an accent key, such as acute, grave, or umlaut, that doesn't
   produce a character by itself, but when followed by another key, produces
   an accented character, such as a-acute, e-grave, u-umlaut, n-tilde, and so
   on.  Very useful for most European languages.  English-language keyboard
   layouts don't use dead keys, as far as we know.)
A. You don't.  The console mode input routines simply do not work correctly in
   Windows 95, and I have not been able to work around them.  In the words
   of a senior developer at Microsoft:
	Win95 console support has always been and will always be flaky.

	The flakiness is unavoidable because we are stuck between the world of
	MS-DOS keyboard TSRs like KEYB (which wants to cook the data;
	important for international) and the world of Win32.

	So keys that don't "exist" in MS-DOS land (like dead keys) have a
	very tenuous existence in Win32 console land.  Keys that act
	differently between MS-DOS land and Win32 console land (like
	capslock) will act flaky.

	Don't even _mention_ the problems with multiple language keyboard
	layouts...

   You may be able to fashion some sort of workaround with the digraphs
   mechanism.							|digraphs|

   The best solution is to use the Win32 GUI version gvim.exe.  Alternatively,
   you can try one of the DOS versions of Vim where dead keys reportedly do
   work.

Q. How do I type dead keys on Windows NT?
A. Dead keys work on NT 3.51.  Just type them as you would in any other
   application.
   On NT 4.0, you need to make sure that the default locale (set in the
   Keyboard part of the Control Panel) is the same as the currently active
   locale.  Otherwise the NT code will get confused and crash!  This is a NT
   4.0 problem, not really a Vim problem.

Q. I'm using Vim to edit a symbolically linked file on a Unix NFS file server.
   When I write the file, Vim does not "write through" the symlink.  Instead,
   it deletes the symbolic link and creates a new file in its place.  Why?
A. On Unix, Vim is prepared for links (symbolic or hard).  A backup copy of
   the original file is made and then the original file is overwritten.  This
   assures that all properties of the file remain the same.  On non-Unix
   systems, the original file is renamed and a new file is written.  Only the
   protection bits are set like the original file.  However, this doesn't work
   properly when working on an NFS-mounted file system where links and other
   things exist.  The only way to fix this in the current version is not
   making a backup file, by ":set nobackup nowritebackup"     |'writebackup'|

Q. I'm using Vim to edit a file on a Unix file server through Samba.  When I
   write the file, the owner of the file is changed.  Why?
A. When writing a file Vim renames the original file, this is a backup (in
   case writing the file fails halfway).  Then the file is written as a new
   file.  Samba then gives it the default owner for the file system, which may
   differ from the original owner.
   To avoid this set the 'backupcopy' option to "yes".  Vim will then make a
   copy of the file for the backup, and overwrite the original file.  The
   owner isn't changed then.

Q. How do I get to see the output of ":make" while it's running?
A. Basically what you need is to put a tee program that will copy its input
   (the output from make) to both stdout and to the errorfile.  You can find a
   copy of tee (and a number of other GNU tools) at
   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net or http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
   Alternatively, try the more recent Cygnus version of the GNU tools at
   http://www.cygwin.com  Other Unix-style tools for Win32 are listed at
   http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/Win32/
   When you do get a copy of tee, you'll need to add >
	:set shellpipe=\|\ tee
<  to your _vimrc.

Q. I'm storing files on a remote machine that works with VisionFS, and files
   disappear!
A. VisionFS can't handle certain dot (.) three letter extension file names.
   SCO declares this behavior required for backwards compatibility with 16bit
   DOS/Windows environments.  The two commands below demonstrate the behavior:
>
	echo Hello > file.bat~ 
	dir > file.bat
<
   The result is that the "dir" command updates the "file.bat~" file, instead
   of creating a new "file.bat" file.  This same behavior is exhibited in Vim
   when editing an existing file named "foo.bat" because the default behavior
   of Vim is to create a temporary file with a '~' character appended to the
   name.  When the file is written, it winds up being deleted.

   Solution: Add this command to your _vimrc file: >
	:set backupext=.temporary

Q. How do I change the blink rate of the cursor?
A. You can't!  This is a limitation of the NT console.  NT 5.0 is reported to
   be able to set the blink rate for all console windows at the same time.

							*:!start*
Q. How can I run an external command or program asynchronously?
A. When using :! to run an external command, you can run it with "start": >
	:!start winfile.exe<CR>
<  Using "start" stops Vim switching to another screen, opening a new console,
   or waiting for the program to complete; it indicates that you are running a
   program that does not affect the files you are editing.  Programs begun
   with :!start do not get passed Vim's open file handles, which means they do
   not have to be closed before Vim.
   To avoid this special treatment, use ":! start".
   There are two optional arguments (see the next Q):
       /min  the window will be minimized
       /b    no console window will be opened
   You can use only one of these flags at a time.  A second one will be
   treated as the start of the command.

Q. How do I avoid getting a window for programs that I run asynchronously?
A. You have two possible solutions depending on what you want:
   1) You may use the /min flag in order to run program in a minimized state
      with no other changes. It will work equally for console and GUI
      applications.
   2) You can use the /b flag to run console applications without creating a
      console window for them (GUI applications are not affected). But you
      should use this flag only if the application you run doesn't require any
      input.  Otherwise it will get an EOF error because its input stream
      (stdin) would be redirected to \\.\NUL (stdout and stderr too).

   Example for a console application, run Exuberant ctags: >
        :!start /min ctags -R .
<  When it has finished you should see file named "tags" in your current
   directory.  You should notice the window title blinking on your taskbar.
   This is more noticeable for commands that take longer.
   Now delete the "tags" file and run this command: >
        :!start /b ctags -R .
<  You should have the same "tags" file, but this time there will be no
   blinking on the taskbar.
   Example for a GUI application: >
        :!start /min notepad
        :!start /b notepad
<  The first command runs notepad minimized and the second one runs it
   normally.

Q. I'm using Win32s, and when I try to run an external command like "make",
   Vim doesn't wait for it to finish!  Help!
A. The problem is that a 32-bit application (Vim) can't get notification from
   Windows that a 16-bit application (your DOS session) has finished.  Vim
   includes a work-around for this, but you must set up your DOS commands to
   run in a window, not full-screen.  Unfortunately the default when you
   install Windows is full-screen.  To change this:
   1) Start PIF editor (in the Main program group).
   2) Open the file "_DEFAULT.PIF" in your Windows directory.
   3) Changes the display option from "Full Screen" to "Windowed".
   4) Save and exit.

   To test, start Vim and type >
	:!dir C:\<CR>".
<  You should see a DOS box window appear briefly with the directory listing.

Q. I use Vim under Win32s and NT.  In NT, I can define the console to default to
   50 lines, so that I get a 80x50 shell when I ':sh'.  Can I do the same in
   W3.1x, or am I stuck with 80x25?
A. Edit SYSTEM.INI and add 'ScreenLines=50' to the [NonWindowsApp] section.  DOS
   prompts and external DOS commands will now run in a 50-line window.

						*windows-icon*
Q. I don't like the Vim icon, can I change it?
A. Yes, place your favorite icon in bitmaps/vim.ico in a directory of
   'runtimepath'.  For example ~/vimfiles/bitmaps/vim.ico.

Patterns and search commands				*pattern-searches*

The very basics can be found in section |03.9| of the user manual.  A few more
explanations are in chapter 27 |usr_27.txt|.

1. Search commands		|search-commands|
2. The definition of a pattern	|search-pattern|
3. Magic			|/magic|
4. Overview of pattern items	|pattern-overview|
5. Multi items			|pattern-multi-items|
6. Ordinary atoms		|pattern-atoms|
7. Ignoring case in a pattern	|/ignorecase|
8. Composing characters		|patterns-composing|
9. Compare with Perl patterns	|perl-patterns|
10. Highlighting matches	|match-highlight|

==============================================================================
1. Search commands				*search-commands*

							*/*
/{pattern}[/]<CR>	Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of
			{pattern} |exclusive|.

/{pattern}/{offset}<CR>	Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of
			{pattern} and go |{offset}| lines up or down.
			|linewise|.

							*/<CR>*
/<CR>			Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with latest used
			|{offset}|.

//{offset}<CR>		Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with new
			|{offset}|.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.

							*?*
?{pattern}[?]<CR>	Search backward for the [count]'th previous
			occurrence of {pattern} |exclusive|.

?{pattern}?{offset}<CR>	Search backward for the [count]'th previous
			occurrence of {pattern} and go |{offset}| lines up or
			down |linewise|.

							*?<CR>*
?<CR>			Search backward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with latest used
			|{offset}|.

??{offset}<CR>		Search backward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with new
			|{offset}|.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.

							*n*
n			Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times.
			|last-pattern| {Vi: no count}

							*N*
N			Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times in
			opposite direction. |last-pattern| {Vi: no count}

							*star* *E348* *E349*
*			Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			word nearest to the cursor.  The word used for the
			search is the first of:
				1. the keyword under the cursor |'iskeyword'|
				2. the first keyword after the cursor, in the
				   current line
				3. the non-blank word under the cursor
				4. the first non-blank word after the cursor,
				   in the current line
			Only whole keywords are searched for, like with the
			command "/\<keyword\>".  |exclusive|  {not in Vi}
			'ignorecase' is used, 'smartcase' is not.

							*#*
#			Same as "*", but search backward.  The pound sign
			(character 163) also works.  If the "#" key works as
			backspace, try using "stty erase <BS>" before starting
			Vim (<BS> is CTRL-H or a real backspace).  {not in Vi}

							*gstar*
g*			Like "*", but don't put "\<" and "\>" around the word.
			This makes the search also find matches that are not a
			whole word.  {not in Vi}

							*g#*
g#			Like "#", but don't put "\<" and "\>" around the word.
			This makes the search also find matches that are not a
			whole word.  {not in Vi}

							*gd*
gd			Goto local Declaration.  When the cursor is on a local
			variable, this command will jump to its declaration.
			First Vim searches for the start of the current
			function, just like "[[".  If it is not found the
			search stops in line 1.  If it is found, Vim goes back
			until a blank line is found.  From this position Vim
			searches for the keyword under the cursor, like with
			"*", but lines that look like a comment are ignored
			(see 'comments' option).
			Note that this is not guaranteed to work, Vim does not
			really check the syntax, it only searches for a match
			with the keyword.  If included files also need to be
			searched use the commands listed in |include-search|.
			After this command |n| searches forward for the next
			match (not backward).
			{not in Vi}

							*gD*
gD			Goto global Declaration.  When the cursor is on a
			global variable that is defined in the file, this
			command will jump to its declaration.  This works just
			like "gd", except that the search for the keyword
			always starts in line 1.  {not in Vi}

							*1gd*
1gd			Like "gd", but ignore matches inside a {} block that
			ends before the cursor position. {not in Vi}

							*1gD*
1gD			Like "gD", but ignore matches inside a {} block that
			ends before the cursor position. {not in Vi}

							*CTRL-C*
CTRL-C			Interrupt current (search) command.  Use CTRL-Break on
			MS-DOS |dos-CTRL-Break|.
			In Normal mode, any pending command is aborted.

							*:noh* *:nohlsearch*
:noh[lsearch]		Stop the highlighting for the 'hlsearch' option.  It
			is automatically turned back on when using a search
			command, or setting the 'hlsearch' option.
			This command doesn't work in an autocommand, because
			the highlighting state is saved and restored when
			executing autocommands |autocmd-searchpat|.
			Same thing for when invoking a user function.

While typing the search pattern the current match will be shown if the
'incsearch' option is on.  Remember that you still have to finish the search
command with <CR> to actually position the cursor at the displayed match.  Or
use <Esc> to abandon the search.

All matches for the last used search pattern will be highlighted if you set
the 'hlsearch' option.  This can be suspended with the |:nohlsearch| command.

When no match is found you get the error: *E486* Pattern not found
Note that for the |:global| command this behaves like a normal message, for Vi
compatibility.  For the |:s| command the "e" flag can be used to avoid the
error message |:s_flags|.

					*search-offset* *{offset}*
These commands search for the specified pattern.  With "/" and "?" an
additional offset may be given.  There are two types of offsets: line offsets
and character offsets.  {the character offsets are not in Vi}

The offset gives the cursor position relative to the found match:
    [num]	[num] lines downwards, in column 1
    +[num]	[num] lines downwards, in column 1
    -[num]	[num] lines upwards, in column 1
    e[+num]	[num] characters to the right of the end of the match
    e[-num]	[num] characters to the left of the end of the match
    s[+num]	[num] characters to the right of the start of the match
    s[-num]	[num] characters to the left of the start of the match
    b[+num]	[num] identical to s[+num] above (mnemonic: begin)
    b[-num]	[num] identical to s[-num] above (mnemonic: begin)
    ;{pattern}  perform another search, see |//;|

If a '-' or '+' is given but [num] is omitted, a count of one will be used.
When including an offset with 'e', the search becomes inclusive (the
character the cursor lands on is included in operations).

Examples:

pattern			cursor position	~
/test/+1		one line below "test", in column 1
/test/e			on the last t of "test"
/test/s+2		on the 's' of "test"
/test/b-3		three characters before "test"

If one of these commands is used after an operator, the characters between
the cursor position before and after the search is affected.  However, if a
line offset is given, the whole lines between the two cursor positions are
affected.

An example of how to search for matches with a pattern and change the match
with another word: >
	/foo<CR>	find "foo"
	c//e<CR>	change until end of match
	bar<Esc>	type replacement
	//<CR>		go to start of next match
	c//e<CR>	change until end of match
	beep<Esc>	type another replacement
			etc.
<
							*//;* *E386*
A very special offset is ';' followed by another search command.  For example: >

   /test 1/;/test
   /test.*/+1;?ing?

The first one first finds the next occurrence of "test 1", and then the first
occurrence of "test" after that.

This is like executing two search commands after each other, except that:
- It can be used as a single motion command after an operator.
- The direction for a following "n" or "N" command comes from the first
  search command.
- When an error occurs the cursor is not moved at all.

							*last-pattern*
The last used pattern and offset are remembered.  They can be used to repeat
the search, possibly in another direction or with another count.  Note that
two patterns are remembered: One for 'normal' search commands and one for the
substitute command ":s".  Each time an empty pattern is given, the previously
used pattern is used.  However, if there is no previous search command, a
previous substitute pattern is used, if possible.

The 'magic' option sticks with the last used pattern.  If you change 'magic',
this will not change how the last used pattern will be interpreted.
The 'ignorecase' option does not do this.  When 'ignorecase' is changed, it
will result in the pattern to match other text.

All matches for the last used search pattern will be highlighted if you set
the 'hlsearch' option.

To clear the last used search pattern: >
	:let @/ = ""
This will not set the pattern to an empty string, because that would match
everywhere.  The pattern is really cleared, like when starting Vim.

The search usually skips matches that don't move the cursor.  Whether the next
match is found at the next character or after the skipped match depends on the
'c' flag in 'cpoptions'.  See |cpo-c|.
	   with 'c' flag:   "/..." advances 1 to 3 characters
	without 'c' flag:   "/..." advances 1 character
The unpredictability with the 'c' flag is caused by starting the search in the
first column, skipping matches until one is found past the cursor position.

When searching backwards, searching starts at the start of the line, using the
'c' flag in 'cpoptions' as described above.  Then the last match before the
cursor position is used.

In Vi the ":tag" command sets the last search pattern when the tag is searched
for.  In Vim this is not done, the previous search pattern is still remembered,
unless the 't' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.  The search pattern is always
put in the search history.

If the 'wrapscan' option is on (which is the default), searches wrap around
the end of the buffer.  If 'wrapscan' is not set, the backward search stops
at the beginning and the forward search stops at the end of the buffer.  If
'wrapscan' is set and the pattern was not found the error message "pattern
not found" is given, and the cursor will not be moved.  If 'wrapscan' is not
set the message becomes "search hit BOTTOM without match" when searching
forward, or "search hit TOP without match" when searching backward.  If
wrapscan is set and the search wraps around the end of the file the message
"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" or "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at
TOP" is given when searching backwards or forwards respectively.  This can be
switched off by setting the 's' flag in the 'shortmess' option.  The highlight
method 'w' is used for this message (default: standout).

							*search-range*
You can limit the search command "/" to a certain range of lines by including
\%>l items.  For example, to match the word "limit" below line 199 and above
line 300: >
	/\%>199l\%<300llimit
Also see |/\%>l|.

Another way is to use the ":substitute" command with the 'c' flag.  Example: >
   :.,300s/Pattern//gc
This command will search from the cursor position until line 300 for
"Pattern".  At the match, you will be asked to type a character.  Type 'q' to
stop at this match, type 'n' to find the next match.

The "*", "#", "g*" and "g#" commands look for a word near the cursor in this
order, the first one that is found is used:
- The keyword currently under the cursor.
- The first keyword to the right of the cursor, in the same line.
- The WORD currently under the cursor.
- The first WORD to the right of the cursor, in the same line.
The keyword may only contain letters and characters in 'iskeyword'.
The WORD may contain any non-blanks (<Tab>s and/or <Space>s).
Note that if you type with ten fingers, the characters are easy to remember:
the "#" is under your left hand middle finger (search to the left and up) and
the "*" is under your right hand middle finger (search to the right and down).
(this depends on your keyboard layout though).

==============================================================================
2. The definition of a pattern		*search-pattern* *pattern* *[pattern]*
					*regular-expression* *regexp* *Pattern*
					*E76* *E383* *E476*

For starters, read chapter 27 of the user manual |usr_27.txt|.

						*/bar* */\bar* */pattern*
1. A pattern is one or more branches, separated by "\|".  It matches anything
   that matches one of the branches.  Example: "foo\|beep" matches "foo" and
   matches "beep".  If more than one branch matches, the first one is used.

   pattern ::=	    branch
		or  branch \| branch
		or  branch \| branch \| branch
		etc.

						*/branch* */\&*
2. A branch is one or more concats, separated by "\&".  It matches the last
   concat, but only if all the preceding concats also match at the same
   position.  Examples:
	"foobeep\&..." matches "foo" in "foobeep".
	".*Peter\&.*Bob" matches in a line containing both "Peter" and "Bob"

   branch ::=	    concat
		or  concat \& concat
		or  concat \& concat \& concat
		etc.

						*/concat*
3. A concat is one or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for the
   first piece, followed by a match for the second piece, etc.  Example:
   "f[0-9]b", first matches "f", then a digit and then "b".

   concat  ::=	    piece
		or  piece piece
		or  piece piece piece
		etc.

						*/piece*
4. A piece is an atom, possibly followed by a multi, an indication of how many
   times the atom can be matched.  Example: "a*" matches any sequence of "a"
   characters: "", "a", "aa", etc.  See |/multi|.

   piece   ::=	    atom
		or  atom  multi

						*/atom*
5. An atom can be one of a long list of items.  Many atoms match one character
   in the text.  It is often an ordinary character or a character class.
   Braces can be used to make a pattern into an atom.  The "\z(\)" construct
   is only for syntax highlighting.

   atom    ::=	    ordinary-atom		|/ordinary-atom|
		or  \( pattern \)		|/\(|
		or  \%( pattern \)		|/\%(|
		or  \z( pattern \)		|/\z(|


				*/\%#=* *two-engines* *NFA*
Vim includes two regexp engines:
1. An old, backtracking engine that supports everything.
2. A new, NFA engine that works much faster on some patterns, but does not
   support everything.

Vim will automatically select the right engine for you.  However, if you run
into a problem or want to specifically select one engine or the other, you can
prepend one of the following to the pattern:

	\%#=0	Force automatic selection.  Only has an effect when
	        'regexpengine' has been set to a non-zero value.
	\%#=1	Force using the old engine.
	\%#=2	Force using the NFA engine.

You can also use the 'regexpengine' option to change the default.

			 *E864* *E868* *E874* *E875* *E876* *E877* *E878*
If selecting the NFA engine and it runs into something that is not implemented
the pattern will not match.  This is only useful when debugging Vim.

==============================================================================
3. Magic							*/magic*

Some characters in the pattern are taken literally.  They match with the same
character in the text.  When preceded with a backslash however, these
characters get a special meaning.

Other characters have a special meaning without a backslash.  They need to be
preceded with a backslash to match literally.

If a character is taken literally or not depends on the 'magic' option and the
items mentioned next.
							*/\m* */\M*
Use of "\m" makes the pattern after it be interpreted as if 'magic' is set,
ignoring the actual value of the 'magic' option.
Use of "\M" makes the pattern after it be interpreted as if 'nomagic' is used.
							*/\v* */\V*
Use of "\v" means that in the pattern after it all ASCII characters except
'0'-'9', 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z' and '_' have a special meaning.  "very magic"

Use of "\V" means that in the pattern after it only the backslash has a
special meaning.  "very nomagic"

Examples:
after:	  \v	   \m	    \M	     \V		matches ~
		'magic' 'nomagic'
	  $	   $	    $	     \$		matches end-of-line
	  .	   .	    \.	     \.		matches any character
	  *	   *	    \*	     \*		any number of the previous atom
	  ()	   \(\)     \(\)     \(\)	grouping into an atom
	  |	   \|	    \|	     \|		separating alternatives
	  \a	   \a	    \a	     \a		alphabetic character
	  \\	   \\	    \\	     \\		literal backslash
	  \.	   \.	    .	     .		literal dot
	  \{	   {	    {	     {		literal '{'
	  a	   a	    a	     a		literal 'a'

{only Vim supports \m, \M, \v and \V}

It is recommended to always keep the 'magic' option at the default setting,
which is 'magic'.  This avoids portability problems.  To make a pattern immune
to the 'magic' option being set or not, put "\m" or "\M" at the start of the
pattern.

==============================================================================
5. Multi items						*pattern-multi-items*

An atom can be followed by an indication of how many times the atom can be
matched and in what way.  This is called a multi.  See |/multi| for an
overview.

						*/star* */\star* *E56*
*	(use \* when 'magic' is not set)
	Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible.
	Example  'nomagic'	matches ~
	a*	   a\*		"", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.
	.*	   \.\*		anything, also an empty string, no end-of-line
	\_.*	   \_.\*	everything up to the end of the buffer
	\_.*END	   \_.\*END	everything up to and including the last "END"
				in the buffer

	Exception: When "*" is used at the start of the pattern or just after
	"^" it matches the star character.

	Be aware that repeating "\_." can match a lot of text and take a long
	time.  For example, "\_.*END" matches all text from the current
	position to the last occurrence of "END" in the file.  Since the "*"
	will match as many as possible, this first skips over all lines until
	the end of the file and then tries matching "END", backing up one
	character at a time.

							*/\+* *E57*
\+	Matches 1 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible. {not in
	Vi}
	Example		matches ~
	^.\+$		any non-empty line
	\s\+		white space of at least one character

							*/\=*
\=	Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding atom, as many as possible. {not in Vi}
	Example		matches ~
	foo\=		"fo" and "foo"

							*/\?*
\?	Just like \=.  Cannot be used when searching backwards with the "?"
	command. {not in Vi}

					*/\{* *E58* *E60* *E554* *E870*
\{n,m}	Matches n to m of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{n}	Matches n of the preceding atom
\{n,}	Matches at least n of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{,m}	Matches 0 to m of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{}	Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible (like *)
							*/\{-*
\{-n,m}	matches n to m of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-n}	matches n of the preceding atom
\{-n,}	matches at least n of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-,m}	matches 0 to m of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-}	matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as few as possible
	{Vi does not have any of these}

	n and m are positive decimal numbers or zero
								*non-greedy*
	If a "-" appears immediately after the "{", then a shortest match
	first algorithm is used (see example below).  In particular, "\{-}" is
	the same as "*" but uses the shortest match first algorithm.  BUT: A
	match that starts earlier is preferred over a shorter match: "a\{-}b"
	matches "aaab" in "xaaab".

	Example			matches ~
	ab\{2,3}c		"abbc" or "abbbc"
	a\{5}			"aaaaa"
	ab\{2,}c		"abbc", "abbbc", "abbbbc", etc.
	ab\{,3}c		"ac", "abc", "abbc" or "abbbc"
	a[bc]\{3}d		"abbbd", "abbcd", "acbcd", "acccd", etc.
	a\(bc\)\{1,2}d		"abcd" or "abcbcd"
	a[bc]\{-}[cd]		"abc" in "abcd"
	a[bc]*[cd]		"abcd" in "abcd"

	The } may optionally be preceded with a backslash: \{n,m\}.

							*/\@=*
\@=	Matches the preceding atom with zero width. {not in Vi}
	Like "(?=pattern)" in Perl.
	Example			matches ~
	foo\(bar\)\@=		"foo" in "foobar"
	foo\(bar\)\@=foo	nothing
							*/zero-width*
	When using "\@=" (or "^", "$", "\<", "\>") no characters are included
	in the match.  These items are only used to check if a match can be
	made.  This can be tricky, because a match with following items will
	be done in the same position.  The last example above will not match
	"foobarfoo", because it tries match "foo" in the same position where
	"bar" matched.

	Note that using "\&" works the same as using "\@=": "foo\&.." is the
	same as "\(foo\)\@=..".  But using "\&" is easier, you don't need the
	braces.


							*/\@!*
\@!	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom does NOT match at the
	current position. |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?!pattern)" in Perl.
	Example			matches ~
	foo\(bar\)\@!		any "foo" not followed by "bar"
	a.\{-}p\@!		"a", "ap", "app", "appp", etc. not immediately
				followed by a "p"
	if \(\(then\)\@!.\)*$	"if " not followed by "then"

	Using "\@!" is tricky, because there are many places where a pattern
	does not match.  "a.*p\@!" will match from an "a" to the end of the
	line, because ".*" can match all characters in the line and the "p"
	doesn't match at the end of the line.  "a.\{-}p\@!" will match any
	"a", "ap", "app", etc. that isn't followed by a "p", because the "."
	can match a "p" and "p\@!" doesn't match after that.

	You can't use "\@!" to look for a non-match before the matching
	position: "\(foo\)\@!bar" will match "bar" in "foobar", because at the
	position where "bar" matches, "foo" does not match.  To avoid matching
	"foobar" you could use "\(foo\)\@!...bar", but that doesn't match a
	bar at the start of a line.  Use "\(foo\)\@<!bar".

	Useful example: to find "foo" in a line that does not contain "bar": >
		/^\%(.*bar\)\@!.*\zsfoo
<	This pattern first checks that there is not a single position in the
	line where "bar" matches.  If ".*bar" matches somewhere the \@! will
	reject the pattern.  When there is no match any "foo" will be found.
	The "\zs" is to have the match start just before "foo".

							*/\@<=*
\@<=	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom matches just before what
	follows. |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?<=pattern)" in Perl, but Vim allows non-fixed-width patterns.
	Example			matches ~
	\(an\_s\+\)\@<=file	"file" after "an" and white space or an
				end-of-line
	For speed it's often much better to avoid this multi.  Try using "\zs"
	instead |/\zs|.  To match the same as the above example:
		an\_s\+\zsfile
	At least set a limit for the look-behind, see below.

	"\@<=" and "\@<!" check for matches just before what follows.
	Theoretically these matches could start anywhere before this position.
	But to limit the time needed, only the line where what follows matches
	is searched, and one line before that (if there is one).  This should
	be sufficient to match most things and not be too slow.

	In the old regexp engine the part of the pattern after "\@<=" and
	"\@<!" are checked for a match first, thus things like "\1" don't work
	to reference \(\) inside the preceding atom.  It does work the other
	way around:
	Bad example			matches ~
	\%#=1\1\@<=,\([a-z]\+\)		",abc" in "abc,abc"

	However, the new regexp engine works differently, it is better to not
	rely on this behavior, do not use \@<= if it can be avoided:
	Example				matches ~
	\([a-z]\+\)\zs,\1		",abc" in "abc,abc"

\@123<=
	Like "\@<=" but only look back 123 bytes. This avoids trying lots
	of matches that are known to fail and make executing the pattern very
	slow.  Example, check if there is a "<" just before "span":
		/<\@1<=span
	This will try matching "<" only one byte before "span", which is the
	only place that works anyway.
	After crossing a line boundary, the limit is relative to the end of
	the line.  Thus the characters at the start of the line with the match
	are not counted (this is just to keep it simple).
	The number zero is the same as no limit.

							*/\@<!*
\@<!	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom does NOT match just
	before what follows.  Thus this matches if there is no position in the
	current or previous line where the atom matches such that it ends just
	before what follows.  |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?<!pattern)" in Perl, but Vim allows non-fixed-width patterns.
	The match with the preceding atom is made to end just before the match
	with what follows, thus an atom that ends in ".*" will work.
	Warning: This can be slow (because many positions need to be checked
	for a match).  Use a limit if you can, see below.
	Example			matches ~
	\(foo\)\@<!bar		any "bar" that's not in "foobar"
	\(\/\/.*\)\@<!in	"in" which is not after "//"

\@123<!
	Like "\@<!" but only look back 123 bytes. This avoids trying lots of
	matches that are known to fail and make executing the pattern very
	slow.

							*/\@>*
\@>	Matches the preceding atom like matching a whole pattern. {not in Vi}
	Like "(?>pattern)" in Perl.
	Example		matches ~
	\(a*\)\@>a	nothing (the "a*" takes all the "a"'s, there can't be
			another one following)

	This matches the preceding atom as if it was a pattern by itself.  If
	it doesn't match, there is no retry with shorter sub-matches or
	anything.  Observe this difference: "a*b" and "a*ab" both match
	"aaab", but in the second case the "a*" matches only the first two
	"a"s.  "\(a*\)\@>ab" will not match "aaab", because the "a*" matches
	the "aaa" (as many "a"s as possible), thus the "ab" can't match.


==============================================================================
6.  Ordinary atoms					*pattern-atoms*

An ordinary atom can be:

							*/^*
^	At beginning of pattern or after "\|", "\(", "\%(" or "\n": matches
	start-of-line; at other positions, matches literal '^'. |/zero-width|
	Example		matches ~
	^beep(		the start of the C function "beep" (probably).

							*/\^*
\^	Matches literal '^'.  Can be used at any position in the pattern.

							*/\_^*
\_^	Matches start-of-line. |/zero-width|  Can be used at any position in
	the pattern.
	Example		matches ~
	\_s*\_^foo	white space and blank lines and then "foo" at
			start-of-line

							*/$*
$	At end of pattern or in front of "\|", "\)" or "\n" ('magic' on):
	matches end-of-line <EOL>; at other positions, matches literal '$'.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\$*
\$	Matches literal '$'.  Can be used at any position in the pattern.

							*/\_$*
\_$	Matches end-of-line. |/zero-width|  Can be used at any position in the
	pattern.  Note that "a\_$b" never matches, since "b" cannot match an
	end-of-line.  Use "a\nb" instead |/\n|.
	Example		matches ~
	foo\_$\_s*	"foo" at end-of-line and following white space and
			blank lines

.	(with 'nomagic': \.)				*/.* */\.*
	Matches any single character, but not an end-of-line.

							*/\_.*
\_.	Matches any single character or end-of-line.
	Careful: "\_.*" matches all text to the end of the buffer!

							*/\<*
\<	Matches the beginning of a word: The next char is the first char of a
	word.  The 'iskeyword' option specifies what is a word character.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\>*
\>	Matches the end of a word: The previous char is the last char of a
	word.  The 'iskeyword' option specifies what is a word character.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\zs*
\zs	Matches at any position, and sets the start of the match there: The
	next char is the first char of the whole match. |/zero-width|
	Example: >
		/^\s*\zsif
<	matches an "if" at the start of a line, ignoring white space.
	Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching
	branch is used.  Example: >
		/\(.\{-}\zsFab\)\{3}
<	Finds the third occurrence of "Fab".
	This cannot be followed by a multi. *E888*
	{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}
							*/\ze*
\ze	Matches at any position, and sets the end of the match there: The
	previous char is the last char of the whole match. |/zero-width|
	Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching
	branch is used.
	Example: "end\ze\(if\|for\)" matches the "end" in "endif" and
	"endfor".
	This cannot be followed by a multi. |E888|
	{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}

						*/\%^* *start-of-file*
\%^	Matches start of the file.  When matching with a string, matches the
	start of the string. {not in Vi}
	For example, to find the first "VIM" in a file: >
		/\%^\_.\{-}\zsVIM
<
						*/\%$* *end-of-file*
\%$	Matches end of the file.  When matching with a string, matches the
	end of the string. {not in Vi}
	Note that this does NOT find the last "VIM" in a file: >
		/VIM\_.\{-}\%$
<	It will find the next VIM, because the part after it will always
	match.  This one will find the last "VIM" in the file: >
		/VIM\ze\(\(VIM\)\@!\_.\)*\%$
<	This uses |/\@!| to ascertain that "VIM" does NOT match in any
	position after the first "VIM".
	Searching from the end of the file backwards is easier!

						*/\%V*
\%V	Match inside the Visual area.  When Visual mode has already been
	stopped match in the area that |gv| would reselect.
	This is a |/zero-width| match.  To make sure the whole pattern is
	inside the Visual area put it at the start and end of the pattern,
	e.g.: >
		/\%Vfoo.*bar\%V
<	Only works for the current buffer.

						*/\%#* *cursor-position*
\%#	Matches with the cursor position.  Only works when matching in a
	buffer displayed in a window. {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When the cursor is moved after the pattern was used, the
	result becomes invalid.  Vim doesn't automatically update the matches.
	This is especially relevant for syntax highlighting and 'hlsearch'.
	In other words: When the cursor moves the display isn't updated for
	this change.  An update is done for lines which are changed (the whole
	line is updated) or when using the |CTRL-L| command (the whole screen
	is updated).  Example, to highlight the word under the cursor: >
		/\k*\%#\k*
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.

						*/\%'m* */\%<'m* */\%>'m*
\%'m	Matches with the position of mark m.
\%<'m	Matches before the position of mark m.
\%>'m	Matches after the position of mark m.
	Example, to highlight the text from mark 's to 'e: >
		/.\%>'s.*\%<'e..
<	Note that two dots are required to include mark 'e in the match.  That
	is because "\%<'e" matches at the character before the 'e mark, and
	since it's a |/zero-width| match it doesn't include that character.
	{not in Vi}
	WARNING: When the mark is moved after the pattern was used, the result
	becomes invalid.  Vim doesn't automatically update the matches.
	Similar to moving the cursor for "\%#" |/\%#|.

						*/\%l* */\%>l* */\%<l*
\%23l	Matches in a specific line.
\%<23l	Matches above a specific line (lower line number).
\%>23l	Matches below a specific line (higher line number).
	These three can be used to match specific lines in a buffer.  The "23"
	can be any line number.  The first line is 1. {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting lines Vim does not automatically
	update the matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly becomes
	wrong.
	Example, to highlight the line where the cursor currently is: >
		:exe '/\%' . line(".") . 'l.*'
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.

						*/\%c* */\%>c* */\%<c*
\%23c	Matches in a specific column.
\%<23c	Matches before a specific column.
\%>23c	Matches after a specific column.
	These three can be used to match specific columns in a buffer or
	string.  The "23" can be any column number.  The first column is 1.
	Actually, the column is the byte number (thus it's not exactly right
	for multi-byte characters).  {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting text Vim does not automatically
	update the matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly becomes
	wrong.
	Example, to highlight the column where the cursor currently is: >
		:exe '/\%' . col(".") . 'c'
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.
	Example for matching a single byte in column 44: >
		/\%>43c.\%<46c
<	Note that "\%<46c" matches in column 45 when the "." matches a byte in
	column 44.
						*/\%v* */\%>v* */\%<v*
\%23v	Matches in a specific virtual column.
\%<23v	Matches before a specific virtual column.
\%>23v	Matches after a specific virtual column.
	These three can be used to match specific virtual columns in a buffer
	or string.  When not matching with a buffer in a window, the option
	values of the current window are used (e.g., 'tabstop').
	The "23" can be any column number.  The first column is 1.
	Note that some virtual column positions will never match, because they
	are halfway through a tab or other character that occupies more than
	one screen character.  {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting text Vim does not automatically
	update highlighted matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly
	becomes wrong.
	Example, to highlight all the characters after virtual column 72: >
		/\%>72v.*
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.
	To match the text up to column 17: >
		/.*\%17v
<	Column 17 is included, because that's where the "\%17v" matches,
	even though this is a |/zero-width| match.  Adding a dot to match the
	next character has the same result: >
		/.*\%17v.
<	This command does the same thing, but also matches when there is no
	character in column 17: >
		/.*\%<18v.

\%(\)	A pattern enclosed by escaped parentheses.	*/\%(\)* */\%(* *E53*
	Just like \(\), but without counting it as a sub-expression.  This
	allows using more groups and it's a little bit faster.
	{not in Vi}

x	A single character, with no special meaning, matches itself

							*/\* */\\*
\x	A backslash followed by a single character, with no special meaning,
	is reserved for future expansions

[]	(with 'nomagic': \[])		*/[]* */\[]* */\_[]* */collection*
\_[]
	A collection.  This is a sequence of characters enclosed in brackets.
	It matches any single character in the collection.
	Example		matches ~
	[xyz]		any 'x', 'y' or 'z'
	[a-zA-Z]$	any alphabetic character at the end of a line
	\c[a-z]$	same
	[-]		Russian alphabet (with utf-8 and cp1251)

								*/[\n]*
	With "\_" prepended the collection also includes the end-of-line.
	The same can be done by including "\n" in the collection.  The
	end-of-line is also matched when the collection starts with "^"!  Thus
	"\_[^ab]" matches the end-of-line and any character but "a" and "b".
	This makes it Vi compatible: Without the "\_" or "\n" the collection
	does not match an end-of-line.
								*E769*
	When the ']' is not there Vim will not give an error message but
	assume no collection is used.  Useful to search for '['.  However, you
	do get E769 for internal searching.

	If the sequence begins with "^", it matches any single character NOT
	in the collection: "[^xyz]" matches anything but 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
	- If two characters in the sequence are separated by '-', this is
	  shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them.  E.g.,
	  "[0-9]" matches any decimal digit.  Non-ASCII characters can be
	  used, but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.
	- A character class expression is evaluated to the set of characters
	  belonging to that character class.  The following character classes
	  are supported:
			  Name		Contents ~
*[:alnum:]*		  [:alnum:]     letters and digits
*[:alpha:]*		  [:alpha:]     letters
*[:blank:]*		  [:blank:]     space and tab characters
*[:cntrl:]*		  [:cntrl:]     control characters
*[:digit:]*		  [:digit:]     decimal digits
*[:graph:]*		  [:graph:]     printable characters excluding space
*[:lower:]*		  [:lower:]     lowercase letters (all letters when
					'ignorecase' is used)
*[:print:]*		  [:print:]     printable characters including space
*[:punct:]*		  [:punct:]     punctuation characters
*[:space:]*		  [:space:]     whitespace characters
*[:upper:]*		  [:upper:]     uppercase letters (all letters when
					'ignorecase' is used)
*[:xdigit:]*		  [:xdigit:]    hexadecimal digits
*[:return:]*		  [:return:]	the <CR> character
*[:tab:]*		  [:tab:]	the <Tab> character
*[:escape:]*		  [:escape:]	the <Esc> character
*[:backspace:]*		  [:backspace:]	the <BS> character
	  The brackets in character class expressions are additional to the
	  brackets delimiting a collection.  For example, the following is a
	  plausible pattern for a UNIX filename: "[-./[:alnum:]_~]\+" That is,
	  a list of at least one character, each of which is either '-', '.',
	  '/', alphabetic, numeric, '_' or '~'.
	  These items only work for 8-bit characters.
							*/[[=* *[==]*
	- An equivalence class.  This means that characters are matched that
	  have almost the same meaning, e.g., when ignoring accents.  This
	  only works for Unicode, latin1 and latin9.  The form is:
		[=a=]
							*/[[.* *[..]*
	- A collation element.  This currently simply accepts a single
	  character in the form:
		[.a.]
							  */\]*
	- To include a literal ']', '^', '-' or '\' in the collection, put a
	  backslash before it: "[xyz\]]", "[\^xyz]", "[xy\-z]" and "[xyz\\]".
	  (Note: POSIX does not support the use of a backslash this way).  For
	  ']' you can also make it the first character (following a possible
	  "^"):  "[]xyz]" or "[^]xyz]" {not in Vi}.
	  For '-' you can also make it the first or last character: "[-xyz]",
	  "[^-xyz]" or "[xyz-]".  For '\' you can also let it be followed by
	  any character that's not in "^]-\bdertnoUux".  "[\xyz]" matches '\',
	  'x', 'y' and 'z'.  It's better to use "\\" though, future expansions
	  may use other characters after '\'.
	- Omitting the trailing ] is not considered an error. "[]" works like
	  "[]]", it matches the ']' character.
	- The following translations are accepted when the 'l' flag is not
	  included in 'cpoptions' {not in Vi}:
		\e	<Esc>
		\t	<Tab>
		\r	<CR>	(NOT end-of-line!)
		\b	<BS>
		\n	line break, see above |/[\n]|
		\d123	decimal number of character
		\o40	octal number of character up to 0377
		\x20	hexadecimal number of character up to 0xff
		\u20AC	hex. number of multibyte character up to 0xffff
		\U1234	hex. number of multibyte character up to 0xffffffff
	  NOTE: The other backslash codes mentioned above do not work inside
	  []!
	- Matching with a collection can be slow, because each character in
	  the text has to be compared with each character in the collection.
	  Use one of the other atoms above when possible.  Example: "\d" is
	  much faster than "[0-9]" and matches the same characters.

						*/\%[]* *E69* *E70* *E369*
\%[]	A sequence of optionally matched atoms.  This always matches.
	It matches as much of the list of atoms it contains as possible.  Thus
	it stops at the first atom that doesn't match.  For example: >
		/r\%[ead]
<	matches "r", "re", "rea" or "read".  The longest that matches is used.
	To match the Ex command "function", where "fu" is required and
	"nction" is optional, this would work: >
		/\<fu\%[nction]\>
<	The end-of-word atom "\>" is used to avoid matching "fu" in "full".
	It gets more complicated when the atoms are not ordinary characters.
	You don't often have to use it, but it is possible.  Example: >
		/\<r\%[[eo]ad]\>
<	Matches the words "r", "re", "ro", "rea", "roa", "read" and "road".
	There can be no \(\), \%(\) or \z(\) items inside the [] and \%[] does
	not nest.
	To include a "[" use "[[]" and for "]" use []]", e.g.,: >
		/index\%[[[]0[]]]
<	matches "index" "index[", "index[0" and "index[0]".
	{not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}

				*/\%d* */\%x* */\%o* */\%u* */\%U* *E678*

\%d123	Matches the character specified with a decimal number.  Must be
	followed by a non-digit.
\%o40	Matches the character specified with an octal number up to 0377.
	Numbers below 040 must be followed by a non-octal digit or a non-digit.
\%x2a	Matches the character specified with up to two hexadecimal characters.
\%u20AC	Matches the character specified with up to four hexadecimal
	characters.
\%U1234abcd	Matches the character specified with up to eight hexadecimal
	characters.

==============================================================================
7. Ignoring case in a pattern					*/ignorecase*

If the 'ignorecase' option is on, the case of normal letters is ignored.
'smartcase' can be set to ignore case when the pattern contains lowercase
letters only.
							*/\c* */\C*
When "\c" appears anywhere in the pattern, the whole pattern is handled like
'ignorecase' is on.  The actual value of 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' is
ignored.  "\C" does the opposite: Force matching case for the whole pattern.
{only Vim supports \c and \C}
Note that 'ignorecase', "\c" and "\C" are not used for the character classes.

Examples:
      pattern	'ignorecase'  'smartcase'	matches ~
	foo	  off		-		foo
	foo	  on		-		foo Foo FOO
	Foo	  on		off		foo Foo FOO
	Foo	  on		on		    Foo
	\cfoo	  -		-		foo Foo FOO
	foo\C	  -		-		foo

Technical detail:				*NL-used-for-Nul*
<Nul> characters in the file are stored as <NL> in memory.  In the display
they are shown as "^@".  The translation is done when reading and writing
files.  To match a <Nul> with a search pattern you can just enter CTRL-@ or
"CTRL-V 000".  This is probably just what you expect.  Internally the
character is replaced with a <NL> in the search pattern.  What is unusual is
that typing CTRL-V CTRL-J also inserts a <NL>, thus also searches for a <Nul>
in the file.  {Vi cannot handle <Nul> characters in the file at all}

						*CR-used-for-NL*
When 'fileformat' is "mac", <NL> characters in the file are stored as <CR>
characters internally.  In the text they are shown as "^J".  Otherwise this
works similar to the usage of <NL> for a <Nul>.

When working with expression evaluation, a <NL> character in the pattern
matches a <NL> in the string.  The use of "\n" (backslash n) to match a <NL>
doesn't work there, it only works to match text in the buffer.

						*pattern-multi-byte*
Patterns will also work with multi-byte characters, mostly as you would
expect.  But invalid bytes may cause trouble, a pattern with an invalid byte
will probably never match.

==============================================================================
8. Composing characters					*patterns-composing*

							*/\Z*
When "\Z" appears anywhere in the pattern, all composing characters are
ignored.  Thus only the base characters need to match, the composing
characters may be different and the number of composing characters may differ.
Only relevant when 'encoding' is "utf-8".
Exception: If the pattern starts with one or more composing characters, these
must match.
							*/\%C*
Use "\%C" to skip any composing characters.  For example, the pattern "a" does
not match in "cat" (where the a has the composing character 0x0300), but
"a\%C" does.  Note that this does not match "ct" (where the  is character
0xe1, it does not have a compositing character).  It does match "cat" (where
the a is just an a).

When a composing character appears at the start of the pattern of after an
item that doesn't include the composing character, a match is found at any
character that includes this composing character.

When using a dot and a composing character, this works the same as the
composing character by itself, except that it doesn't matter what comes before
this.

The order of composing characters does not matter.  Also, the text may have
more composing characters than the pattern, it still matches.  But all
composing characters in the pattern must be found in the text.

Suppose B is a base character and x and y are composing characters:
	pattern		text		match ~
	Bxy		Bxy		yes (perfect match)
	Bxy		Byx		yes (order ignored)
	Bxy		By		no (x missing)
	Bxy		Bx		no (y missing)
	Bx		Bx		yes (perfect match)
	Bx		By		no (x missing)
	Bx		Bxy		yes (extra y ignored)
	Bx		Byx		yes (extra y ignored)

==============================================================================
9. Compare with Perl patterns				*perl-patterns*

Vim's regexes are most similar to Perl's, in terms of what you can do.  The
difference between them is mostly just notation;  here's a summary of where
they differ:

Capability			in Vimspeak	in Perlspeak ~
----------------------------------------------------------------
force case insensitivity	\c		(?i)
force case sensitivity		\C		(?-i)
backref-less grouping		\%(atom\)	(?:atom)
conservative quantifiers	\{-n,m}		*?, +?, ??, {}?
0-width match			atom\@=		(?=atom)
0-width non-match		atom\@!		(?!atom)
0-width preceding match		atom\@<=	(?<=atom)
0-width preceding non-match	atom\@<!	(?<!atom)
match without retry		atom\@>		(?>atom)

Vim and Perl handle newline characters inside a string a bit differently:

In Perl, ^ and $ only match at the very beginning and end of the text,
by default, but you can set the 'm' flag, which lets them match at
embedded newlines as well.  You can also set the 's' flag, which causes
a . to match newlines as well.  (Both these flags can be changed inside
a pattern using the same syntax used for the i flag above, BTW.)

On the other hand, Vim's ^ and $ always match at embedded newlines, and
you get two separate atoms, \%^ and \%$, which only match at the very
start and end of the text, respectively.  Vim solves the second problem
by giving you the \_ "modifier":  put it in front of a . or a character
class, and they will match newlines as well.

Finally, these constructs are unique to Perl:
- execution of arbitrary code in the regex:  (?{perl code})
- conditional expressions:  (?(condition)true-expr|false-expr)

...and these are unique to Vim:
- changing the magic-ness of a pattern:  \v \V \m \M
   (very useful for avoiding backslashitis)
- sequence of optionally matching atoms:  \%[atoms]
- \& (which is to \| what "and" is to "or";  it forces several branches
   to match at one spot)
- matching lines/columns by number:  \%5l \%5c \%5v
- setting the start and end of the match:  \zs \ze

==============================================================================
10. Highlighting matches				*match-highlight*

							*:mat* *:match*
:mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/
		Define a pattern to highlight in the current window.  It will
		be highlighted with {group}.  Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:match MyGroup /TODO/
<		Instead of // any character can be used to mark the start and
		end of the {pattern}.  Watch out for using special characters,
		such as '"' and '|'.

		{group} must exist at the moment this command is executed.

		The {group} highlighting still applies when a character is
		to be highlighted for 'hlsearch', as the highlighting for
		matches is given higher priority than that of 'hlsearch'.
		Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is also overruled by
		matches.

		Note that highlighting the last used search pattern with
		'hlsearch' is used in all windows, while the pattern defined
		with ":match" only exists in the current window.  It is kept
		when switching to another buffer.

		'ignorecase' does not apply, use |/\c| in the pattern to
		ignore case.  Otherwise case is not ignored.

		'redrawtime' defines the maximum time searched for pattern
		matches.

		When matching end-of-line and Vim redraws only part of the
		display you may get unexpected results.  That is because Vim
		looks for a match in the line where redrawing starts.

		Also see |matcharg()| and |getmatches()|. The former returns
		the highlight group and pattern of a previous |:match|
		command.  The latter returns a list with highlight groups and
		patterns defined by both |matchadd()| and |:match|.

		Highlighting matches using |:match| are limited to three
		matches (aside from |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match| are
		available). |matchadd()| does not have this limitation and in
		addition makes it possible to prioritize matches.

		Another example, which highlights all characters in virtual
		column 72 and more: >
			:highlight rightMargin term=bold ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
			:match rightMargin /.\%>72v/
<		To highlight all character that are in virtual column 7: >
			:highlight col8 ctermbg=grey guibg=grey
			:match col8 /\%<8v.\%>7v/
<		Note the use of two items to also match a character that
		occupies more than one virtual column, such as a TAB.

:mat[ch]
:mat[ch] none
		Clear a previously defined match pattern.


:2mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/					*:2match*
:2mat[ch]
:2mat[ch] none
:3mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/					*:3match*
:3mat[ch]
:3mat[ch] none
		Just like |:match| above, but set a separate match.  Thus
		there can be three matches active at the same time.  The match
		with the lowest number has priority if several match at the
		same position.
		The ":3match" command is used by the |matchparen| plugin.  You
		are suggested to use ":match" for manual matching and
		":2match" for another plugin.

==============================================================================
2. GetLatestVimScripts -- Getting Started		*getscript-start*
						*getlatestvimscripts-install*

	VERSION FROM VIM DISTRIBUTION			*glvs-dist-install*

Vim 7.0 does not include the GetLatestVimScripts.dist file which
serves as an example and a template.  So, you'll need to create
your own!  See |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|.

	VERSION FROM VIM SF NET				*glvs-install*

NOTE: The last step, that of renaming/moving the GetLatestVimScripts.dist
file, is for those who have just downloaded GetLatestVimScripts.tar.bz2 for
the first time.

The GetLatestVimScripts.dist file serves as an example and a template for your
own personal list.  Feel free to remove all the scripts mentioned within it;
the "important" part of it is the first two lines.

Your computer needs to have wget or curl for GetLatestVimScripts to do its work.

	1. if compressed:  gunzip getscript.vba.gz
	2. Unix:
		vim getscript.vba
		:so %
		:q
		cd ~/.vim/GetLatest
		mv GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
		(edit GetLatestVimScripts.dat to install your own personal
		list of desired plugins -- see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|)
	
	3. Windows:
		vim getscript.vba
		:so %
		:q
		cd **path-to-vimfiles**/GetLatest
		mv GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
		(edit GetLatestVimScripts.dat to install your own personal
		list of desired plugins -- see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|)


==============================================================================
3. GetLatestVimScripts Usage				*glvs-usage* *:GLVS*

Unless it has been defined elsewhere, >

	:GLVS

will invoke GetLatestVimScripts().  If some other plugin has defined that
command, then you may type
>
	:GetLatestVimScripts
<
The script will attempt to update and, if permitted, will automatically
install scripts from http://vim.sourceforge.net/.  To do so it will peruse a
file,
>
	.vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat                    (unix)
<
or >
	..wherever..\vimfiles\GetLatest\GetLatestVimScripts.dat   (windows)
(see |glvs-data|), and examine plugins in your [.vim|vimfiles]/plugin
directory (see |glvs-plugins|).

Scripts which have been downloaded will appear in the
~/.vim/GetLatest (unix) or ..wherever..\vimfiles\GetLatest (windows)
subdirectory.  GetLatestVimScripts will attempt to automatically
install them if you have the following line in your <.vimrc>: >

	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall=1

The <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file will be automatically be updated to
reflect the latest version of script(s) so downloaded.
(also see |glvs-options|)


==============================================================================
4. GetLatestVimScripts Data File		*getscript-data* *glvs-data*
 						*:GetLatestVimScripts_dat*
The data file <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> must have for its first two lines
the following text:
>
	ScriptID SourceID Filename
	--------------------------
<
Following those two lines are three columns; the first two are numeric
followed by a text column.  The GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dist file
contains an example of such a data file.  Anything following a #... is
ignored, so you may embed comments in the file.

The first number on each line gives the script's ScriptID.  When you're about
to use a web browser to look at scripts on http://vim.sf.net/, just before you
click on the script's link, you'll see a line resembling

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

The "40" happens to be a ScriptID that GetLatestVimScripts needs to
download the associated page, and is assigned by vim.sf.net itself
during initial uploading of the plugin.

The second number on each line gives the script's SourceID.  The SourceID
records the count of uploaded scripts as determined by vim.sf.net; hence it
serves to indicate "when" a script was uploaded.  Setting the SourceID to 1
insures that GetLatestVimScripts will assume that the script it has is
out-of-date.

The SourceID is extracted by GetLatestVimScripts from the script's page on
vim.sf.net; whenever it is greater than the one stored in the
GetLatestVimScripts.dat file, the script will be downloaded
(see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|).

If your script's author has included a special comment line in his/her plugin,
the plugin itself will be used by GetLatestVimScripts to build your
<GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file, including any dependencies on other scripts it
may have.  As an example, consider: >

	" GetLatestVimScripts: 884  1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim

This comment line tells getscript.vim to check vimscript #884 and that the
script is automatically installable.  Getscript will also use this line to
help build the GetLatestVimScripts.dat file, by including a line such as: >

	884 1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<
assuming that such a line isn't already in GetLatestVimScripts.dat file.
See |glvs-plugins| for more.  Thus, GetLatestVimScripts thus provides a
comprehensive ability to keep your plugins up-to-date!

In summary:

  * Optionally tell getscript that it is allowed to build/append a
    GetLatestVimScripts.dat file based upon already installed plugins: >
	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall=1
<
  * A line such as >
	" GetLatestVimScripts: 884  1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<   in an already-downloaded plugin constitutes the concurrence of the
    plugin author that getscript may do AutoInstall.  Not all plugins
    may be AutoInstall-able, and the plugin's author is best situated
    to know whether or not his/her plugin will AutoInstall properly.

  * A line such as >
	884 1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<   in your GetLatestVimScripts.dat file constitutes your permission
    to getscript to do AutoInstall.  AutoInstall requires both your
    and the plugin author's permission.  See |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|.


						*GetLatestVimScripts_dat*
As an example of a <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file:
>
    ScriptID SourceID Filename
    --------------------------
    294 1 :AutoInstall: Align.vim
    120 2 Decho.vim
     40 3 DrawIt.tar.gz
    451 4 EasyAccents.vim
    195 5 engspchk.vim
    642 6 GetLatestVimScripts.vim
    489 7 Manpageview.vim
<
Note: the first two lines are required, but essentially act as comments.


==============================================================================
5. GetLatestVimScripts Friendly Plugins	*getscript-plugins* *glvs-plugins*

		(this section is for plugin authors)~

If a plugin author includes the following comment anywhere in their plugin,
GetLatestVimScripts will find it and use it to automatically build the user's
GetLatestVimScripts.dat files:
>
	                         src_id
	                            v
	" GetLatestVimScripts: ### ### yourscriptname
	                        ^
	                    scriptid
<
As an author, you should include such a line in to refer to your own script
plus any additional lines describing any plugin dependencies it may have.
Same format, of course!

If your command is auto-installable (see |glvs-autoinstall|), and most scripts
are, then you may include :AutoInstall: just before "yourscriptname":
>
	                         src_id
	                            v
	" GetLatestVimScripts: ### ### :AutoInstall: yourscriptname
	                        ^
	                    scriptid
<
NOTE: The :AutoInstall: feature requires both the plugin author's and~
      the user's permission to operate!~

GetLatestVimScripts commands for those scripts are then appended, if not
already present, to the user's GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat file.  It is
a relatively painless way to automate the acquisition of any scripts your
plugins depend upon.

Now, as an author, you probably don't want GetLatestVimScripts to download
your own scripts atop your own copy, thereby overwriting your not-yet-released
hard work.  GetLatestVimScripts provides a solution for this:  put
>
	0 0 yourscriptname
<
into your <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file and GetLatestVimScripts will skip
examining the "yourscriptname" scripts for those GetLatestVimScripts comment
lines.  As a result, those lines won't be inadvertently installed into your
<GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file and subsequently used to download your own
scripts.  This is especially important to do if you've included the
:AutoInstall: option.

Be certain to use the same "yourscriptname" in the "0 0 yourscriptname" line
as you've used in your GetLatestVimScripts comment!


==============================================================================
6. GetLatestVimScripts AutoInstall			*getscript-autoinstall*
							*glvs-autoinstall*

GetLatestVimScripts now supports "AutoInstall".  Not all scripts are
supportive of auto-install, as they may have special things you need to do to
install them (please refer to the script's "install" directions).  On the
other hand, most scripts will be auto-installable.

To let GetLatestVimScripts do an autoinstall, the data file's comment field
should begin with (surrounding blanks are ignored): >

	:AutoInstall:
<
Both colons are needed, and it should begin the comment (yourscriptname)
field.

One may prevent any autoinstalling by putting the following line in your
<.vimrc>: >

	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall= 0
<
With :AutoInstall: enabled, as it is by default, files which end with

	---.tar.bz2  : decompressed & untarred in .vim/ directory
	---.vba.bz2  : decompressed in .vim/ directory, then vimball handles it
	---.vim.bz2  : decompressed & moved into .vim/plugin directory
	---.tar.gz   : decompressed & untarred in .vim/ directory
	---.vba.gz   : decompressed in .vim/ directory, then vimball handles it
	---.vim.gz   : decompressed & moved into .vim/plugin directory
	---.vba      : unzipped in .vim/ directory
	---.vim      : moved to .vim/plugin directory
	---.zip      : unzipped in .vim/ directory

and which merely need to have their components placed by the untar/gunzip or
move-to-plugin-directory process should be auto-installable.  Vimballs, of
course, should always be auto-installable.

When is a script not auto-installable?  Let me give an example:

	.vim/after/syntax/blockhl.vim

The <blockhl.vim> script provides block highlighting for C/C++ programs; it is
available at:

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=104

Currently, vim's after/syntax only supports by-filetype scripts (in
blockhl.vim's case, that's after/syntax/c.vim).  Hence, auto-install would
possibly overwrite the current user's after/syntax/c.vim file.

In my own case, I use <aftersyntax.vim> (renamed to after/syntax/c.vim) to
allow a after/syntax/c/ directory:

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1023

The script allows multiple syntax files to exist separately in the
after/syntax/c subdirectory.  I can't bundle aftersyntax.vim in and build an
appropriate tarball for auto-install because of the potential for the
after/syntax/c.vim contained in it to overwrite a user's c.vim.


==============================================================================
7. GetLatestVimScripts Options					*glvs-options*
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_wget
<	default= "wget"
		This variable holds the name of the command for obtaining
		scripts.
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_options
<	default= "-q -O"
		This variable holds the options to be used with the
		g:GetLatestVimScripts_wget command.
>
 	g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall
<	default= 1
		This variable indicates whether GetLatestVimScripts is allowed
		to attempt to automatically install scripts.  Furthermore, the
		plugin author has to have explicitly indicated that his/her
		plugin is automatically installable (via the :AutoInstall:
		keyword in the GetLatestVimScripts comment line).
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_autoinstalldir
<	default= $HOME/.vim     (linux)
	default= $HOME/vimfiles (windows)
		Override where :AutoInstall: scripts will be installed.
		Doesn't override vimball installation.
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_scriptaddr
<       default='http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id='
		Override this if your system needs
	  ...  ='http://vim.sourceforge.net/script/script.php?script_id='

==============================================================================
8. GetLatestVimScripts Algorithm		*glvs-algorithm* *glvs-alg*

The Vim sourceforge page dynamically creates a page by keying off of the
so-called script-id.  Within the webpage of

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

is a line specifying the latest source-id (src_id).  The source identifier
numbers are always increasing, hence if the src_id is greater than the one
recorded for the script in GetLatestVimScripts then it's time to download a
newer copy of that script.

GetLatestVimScripts will then download the script and update its internal
database of script ids, source ids, and scriptnames.

The AutoInstall process will:

	Move the file from GetLatest/ to the following directory
		Unix   : $HOME/.vim
		Windows: $HOME\vimfiles
	if the downloaded file ends with ".bz2"
		bunzip2 it
	else if the downloaded file ends with ".gz"
		gunzip it
	if the resulting file ends with ".zip"
		unzip it
	else if the resulting file ends with ".tar"
		tar -oxvf it
	else if the resulting file ends with ".vim"
		move it to the plugin subdirectory

9. GetLatestVimScripts History		*getscript-history* *glvs-hist* {{{1

v36 Apr 22, 2013 : * (glts) suggested use of plugin/**/*.vim instead of
		     plugin/*.vim in globpath() call.
		   * (Andy Wokula) got warning message when setting
		     g:loaded_getscriptPlugin
v35 Apr 07, 2012 : * (MengHuan Yu) pointed out that the script url has
		     changed (somewhat).  However, it doesn't work, and
		     the original one does (under Linux). I'll make it
		     yet-another-option.
v34 Jun 23, 2011 : * handles additional decompression options for tarballs
                     (tgz taz tbz txz)
v33 May 31, 2011 : * using fnameescape() instead of escape()
		   * *.xz support
v32 Jun 19, 2010 : * (Jan Steffens) added support for xz compression
v31 Jun 29, 2008 : * (Bill McCarthy) fixed having hls enabled with getscript
		   * (David Schaefer) the acd option interferes with vimballs
		     Solution: bypass the acd option
v30 Jun 13, 2008 : * GLVS now checks for existence of fnameescape() and will
		     issue an error message if it is not supported
v29 Jan 07, 2008 : * Bram M pointed out that cpo is a global option and that
                     getscriptPlugin.vim was setting it but not restoring it.
v28 Jan 02, 2008 : * improved shell quoting character handling, cygwin
		     interface, register-a bypass
    Oct 29, 2007   * Bill McCarthy suggested a change to getscript that avoids
                     creating pop-up windows
v24 Apr 16, 2007 : * removed save&restore of the fo option during script
                     loading
v23 Nov 03, 2006 : * ignores comments (#...)
                   * handles vimballs
v22 Oct 13, 2006 : * supports automatic use of curl if wget is not
                     available
v21 May 01, 2006 : * now takes advantage of autoloading.
v20 Dec 23, 2005 : * Eric Haarbauer found&fixed a bug with unzip use;
                     unzip needs the -o flag to overwrite.
v19 Nov 28, 2005 : * v18's GetLatestVimScript line accessed the wrong
                     script! Fixed.
v18 Mar 21, 2005 : * bugfix to automatic database construction
                   * bugfix - nowrapscan caused an error
                     (tnx to David Green for the fix)
    Apr 01, 2005   * if shell is bash, "mv" instead of "ren" used in
                     :AutoInstall:s, even though its o/s is windows
    Apr 01, 2005   * when downloading errors occurred, GLVS was
                     terminating early.  It now just goes on to trying
                     the next script (after trying three times to
                     download a script description page)
    Apr 20, 2005   * bugfix - when a failure to download occurred,
                     GetLatestVimScripts would stop early and claim that
                     everything was current.  Fixed.
v17 Aug 25, 2004 : * g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall, which
                     defaults to 1, can be used to prevent all
                     :AutoInstall:
v16 Aug 25, 2004 : * made execution of bunzip2/gunzip/tar/zip silent
                   * fixed bug with :AutoInstall: use of helptags
v15 Aug 24, 2004 : * bugfix: the "0 0 comment" download prevention wasn't
                     always preventing downloads (just usually).  Fixed.
v14 Aug 24, 2004 : * bugfix -- helptags was using dotvim, rather than
                     s:dotvim.  Fixed.
v13 Aug 23, 2004 : * will skip downloading a file if its scriptid or srcid
                     is zero.  Useful for script authors; that way their
                     own GetLatestVimScripts activity won't overwrite
                     their scripts.
v12 Aug 23, 2004 : * bugfix - a "return" got left in the distribution that
                     was intended only for testing.  Removed, now works.
                   * :AutoInstall: implemented
v11 Aug 20, 2004 : * GetLatestVimScripts is now a plugin:
                   * :GetLatestVimScripts command
                   * (runtimepath)/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat
                     now holds scripts that need updating
v10 Apr 19, 2004 : * moved history from script to doc
v9  Jan 23, 2004 :   windows (win32/win16/win95) will use
                     double quotes ("") whereas other systems will use
                     single quotes ('') around the urls in calls via wget
v8  Dec 01, 2003 :   makes three tries at downloading
v7  Sep 02, 2003 :   added error messages if "Click on..." or "src_id="
                     not found in downloaded webpage
                     Uses t_ti, t_te, and rs to make progress visible
v6  Aug 06, 2003 :   final status messages now display summary of work
                     ( "Downloaded someqty scripts" or
                       "Everything was current")
                     Now GetLatestVimScripts is careful about downloading
                     GetLatestVimScripts.vim itself!
                     (goes to <NEW_GetLatestVimScripts.vim>)
v5  Aug 04, 2003 :   missing an endif near bottom
v4  Jun 17, 2003 :   redraw! just before each "considering" message
v3  May 27, 2003 :   Protects downloaded files from errant shell
                     expansions with single quotes: '...'
v2  May 14, 2003 :   extracts name of item to be obtained from the
                     script file.  Uses it instead of comment field
                     for output filename; comment is used in the
                     "considering..." line and is now just a comment!
                   * Fixed a bug: a string-of-numbers is not the
                     same as a number, so I added zero to them
                     and they became numbers.  Fixes comparison.

Last change: 2012 Jul 19


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Editing compressed files with Vim		*gzip* *bzip2* *compress*

1. Autocommands			|gzip-autocmd|

The functionality mentioned here is a |standard-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.
You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_gzip" variable: >
	:let loaded_gzip = 1

{Vi does not have any of this}

==============================================================================
1. Autocommands						*gzip-autocmd*

The plugin installs autocommands to intercept reading and writing of files
with these extensions:

	extension	compression ~
	*.Z		compress (Lempel-Ziv)
	*.gz		gzip
	*.bz2		bzip2
	*.lzma		lzma
	*.xz		xz

That's actually the only thing you need to know.  There are no options.

After decompressing a file, the filetype will be detected again.  This will
make a file like "foo.c.gz" get the "c" filetype.

If you have 'patchmode' set, it will be appended after the extension for
compression.  Thus editing the patchmode file will not give you the automatic
decompression.  You have to rename the file if you want this.

==============================================================================
2. Starting With Netrw					*netrw-start* {{{1

Netrw makes reading files, writing files, browsing over a network, and
local browsing easy!  First, make sure that you have plugins enabled, so
you'll need to have at least the following in your <.vimrc>:
(or see |netrw-activate|) >

	set nocp                    " 'compatible' is not set
	filetype plugin on          " plugins are enabled
<
(see |'cp'| and |:filetype-plugin-on|)

Netrw supports "transparent" editing of files on other machines using urls
(see |netrw-transparent|). As an example of this, let's assume you have an
account on some other machine; if you can use scp, try: >

	vim scp://hostname/path/to/file
<
Want to make ssh/scp easier to use? Check out |netrw-ssh-hack|!

So, what if you have ftp, not ssh/scp?  That's easy, too; try >

	vim ftp://hostname/path/to/file
<
Want to make ftp simpler to use?  See if your ftp supports a file called
<.netrc> -- typically it goes in your home directory, has read/write
permissions for only the user to read (ie. not group, world, other, etc),
and has lines resembling >

	machine HOSTNAME login USERID password "PASSWORD"
	machine HOSTNAME login USERID password "PASSWORD"
	...
	default          login USERID password "PASSWORD"
<
Windows' ftp doesn't support .netrc; however, one may have in one's .vimrc:  >

   let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= 'c:\Windows\System32\ftp -s:C:\Users\MyUserName\MACHINE'
<
Netrw will substitute the host's machine name for "MACHINE" from the url it is
attempting to open, and so one may specify >
	userid
	password
for each site in a separate file: c:\Users\MyUserName\MachineName.

Now about browsing -- when you just want to look around before editing a
file.  For browsing on your current host, just "edit" a directory: >

	vim .
	vim /home/userid/path
<
For browsing on a remote host, "edit" a directory (but make sure that
the directory name is followed by a "/"): >

	vim scp://hostname/
	vim ftp://hostname/path/to/dir/
<
See |netrw-browse| for more!

There are more protocols supported by netrw than just scp and ftp, too: see the
next section, |netrw-externapp|, on how to use these external applications with
netrw and vim.

PREVENTING LOADING					*netrw-noload*

If you want to use plugins, but for some reason don't wish to use netrw, then
you need to avoid loading both the plugin and the autoload portions of netrw.
You may do so by placing the following two lines in your <.vimrc>: >

	:let g:loaded_netrw       = 1
	:let g:loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Netrw Reference					*netrw-ref* {{{1

   Netrw supports several protocols in addition to scp and ftp as mentioned
   in |netrw-start|.  These include dav, fetch, http,... well, just look
   at the list in |netrw-externapp|.  Each protocol is associated with a
   variable which holds the default command supporting that protocol.

EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS AND PROTOCOLS			*netrw-externapp* {{{2

	Protocol  Variable	       Default Value
	--------  ----------------     -------------
	   dav:   *g:netrw_dav_cmd*      = "cadaver"    if cadaver is executable
	   dav:   g:netrw_dav_cmd      = "curl -o"    elseif curl is available
	 fetch:   *g:netrw_fetch_cmd*    = "fetch -o"   if fetch is available
	   ftp:   *g:netrw_ftp_cmd*      = "ftp"
	  http:   *g:netrw_http_cmd*     = "elinks"     if   elinks  is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "links"      elseif links is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "curl"       elseif curl  is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "wget"       elseif wget  is available
          http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "fetch"      elseif fetch is available
	  http:   *g:netrw_http_put_cmd* = "curl -T"
	   rcp:   *g:netrw_rcp_cmd*      = "rcp"
	 rsync:   *g:netrw_rsync_cmd*    = "rsync -a"
	   scp:   *g:netrw_scp_cmd*      = "scp -q"
	  sftp:   *g:netrw_sftp_cmd*     = "sftp"

	*g:netrw_http_xcmd* : the option string for http://... protocols are
	specified via this variable and may be independently overridden.  By
	default, the option arguments for the http-handling commands are: >

		    elinks : "-source >"
		    links  : "-dump >"
		    curl   : "-o"
		    wget   : "-q -O"
		    fetch  : "-o"
<
	For example, if your system has elinks, and you'd rather see the
	page using an attempt at rendering the text, you may wish to have >
		let g:netrw_http_xcmd= "-dump >"
<	in your .vimrc.

	g:netrw_http_put_cmd: this option specifies both the executable and
	any needed options.  This command does a PUT operation to the url.


READING						*netrw-read* *netrw-nread* {{{2

	Generally, one may just use the url notation with a normal editing
	command, such as >

		:e ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nread command:

	:Nread ?					give help
	:Nread "machine:path"				uses rcp
	:Nread "machine path"				uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nread "machine id password path"		uses ftp
	:Nread "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nread "fetch://[user@]machine/path"		uses fetch
	:Nread "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nread "http://[user@]machine/path"		uses http  uses wget
	:Nread "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nread "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nread "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nread "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp

WRITING					*netrw-write* *netrw-nwrite* {{{2

	One may just use the url notation with a normal file writing
	command, such as >

		:w ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nwrite command:

	:Nwrite ?					give help
	:Nwrite "machine:path"				uses rcp
	:Nwrite "machine path"				uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nwrite "machine id password path"		uses ftp
	:Nwrite "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nwrite "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nwrite "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nwrite "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nwrite "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nwrite "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp
	http: not supported!

SOURCING					*netrw-source* {{{2

	One may just use the url notation with the normal file sourcing
	command, such as >

		:so ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nsource command:

	:Nsource ?					give help
	:Nsource "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nsource "fetch://[user@]machine/path"		uses fetch
	:Nsource "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nsource "http://[user@]machine/path"		uses http  uses wget
	:Nsource "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nsource "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nsource "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nsource "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp

DIRECTORY LISTING		*netrw-trailingslash* *netrw-dirlist* {{{2

	One may browse a directory to get a listing by simply attempting to
	edit the directory: >

		:e scp://[user]@hostname/path/
		:e ftp://[user]@hostname/path/
<
	For remote directory listings (ie. those using scp or ftp), that
	trailing "/" is necessary (the slash tells netrw to treat the argument
	as a directory to browse instead of as a file to download).

	The Nread command may also be used to accomplish this (again, that
	trailing slash is necessary): >

		:Nread [protocol]://[user]@hostname/path/
<
					*netrw-login* *netrw-password*
CHANGING USERID AND PASSWORD		*netrw-chgup* *netrw-userpass* {{{2

	Attempts to use ftp will prompt you for a user-id and a password.
	These will be saved in global variables |g:netrw_uid| and
	|s:netrw_passwd|; subsequent use of ftp will re-use those two strings,
	thereby simplifying use of ftp.  However, if you need to use a
	different user id and/or password, you'll want to call |NetUserPass()|
	first.  To work around the need to enter passwords, check if your ftp
	supports a <.netrc> file in your home directory.  Also see
	|netrw-passwd| (and if you're using ssh/scp hoping to figure out how
	to not need to use passwords for scp, look at |netrw-ssh-hack|).

	:NetUserPass [uid [password]]		-- prompts as needed
	:call NetUserPass()			-- prompts for uid and password
	:call NetUserPass("uid")		-- prompts for password
	:call NetUserPass("uid","password")	-- sets global uid and password

(Related topics: |ftp| |netrw-userpass| |netrw-start|)

NETRW VARIABLES AND SETTINGS				*netrw-variables* {{{2
    (Also see:
    |netrw-browser-var|     : netrw browser option variables
    |netrw-protocol|        : file transfer protocol option variables
    |netrw-settings|        : additional file transfer options
    |netrw-browser-options| : these options affect browsing directories
    )

Netrw provides a lot of variables which allow you to customize netrw to your
preferences.  One way to look at them is via the command :NetrwSettings (see
|netrw-settings|) which will display your current netrw settings.  Most such
settings are described below, in |netrw-browser-options|, and in
|netrw-externapp|:

 *b:netrw_lastfile*	last file Network-read/written retained on a
			per-buffer basis (supports plain :Nw )

 *g:netrw_bufsettings*	the settings that netrw buffers have
 			(default) noma nomod nonu nowrap ro nobl

 *g:netrw_chgwin*	specifies a window number where subsequent file edits
			will take place.  (also see |netrw-C|)
			(default) -1

 *g:Netrw_funcref*	specifies a function (or functions) to be called when
			netrw edits a file.  The file is first edited, and
			then the function reference (|Funcref|) is called.
			This variable may also hold a |List| of Funcrefs.
			(default) not defined.  (the capital in g:Netrw...
			is required by its holding a function reference)
>
			    Example: place in .vimrc; affects all file opening
			    fun! MyFuncRef()
			    endfun
			    let g:Netrw_funcref= function("MyFuncRef")
<
 *g:netrw_ftp*		   if it doesn't exist, use default ftp
			=0 use default ftp		       (uid password)
			=1 use alternate ftp method	  (user uid password)
			   If you're having trouble with ftp, try changing the
			   value of this variable to see if the alternate ftp
			   method works for your setup.

 *g:netrw_ftp_options*     Chosen by default, these options are supposed to
			 turn interactive prompting off and to restrain ftp
			 from attempting auto-login upon initial connection.
			 However, it appears that not all ftp implementations
			 support this (ex. ncftp).
		        ="-i -n"

 *g:netrw_ftpextracmd*	default: doesn't exist
			If this variable exists, then any string it contains
			will be placed into the commands set to your ftp
			client.  As an example:
			   ="passive"

 *g:netrw_ftpmode*	="binary"				    (default)
			="ascii"

 *g:netrw_ignorenetrc*	=0 (default for linux, cygwin)
			=1 If you have a <.netrc> file but it doesn't work and
			   you want it ignored, then set this variable as
			   shown. (default for Windows + cmd.exe)

 *g:netrw_menu*		=0 disable netrw's menu
			=1 (default) netrw's menu enabled

 *g:netrw_nogx*		if this variable exists, then the "gx" map will not
			be available (see |netrw-gx|)

 *g:netrw_uid*		(ftp) user-id,      retained on a per-vim-session basis
 *s:netrw_passwd* 	(ftp) password,     retained on a per-vim-session basis

 *g:netrw_preview*	=0 (default) preview window shown in a horizontally
			   split window
			=1 preview window shown in a vertically split window.
			   Also affects the "previous window" (see |netrw-P|)
			   in the same way.

 *g:netrw_scpport*	= "-P" : option to use to set port for scp
 *g:netrw_sshport*	= "-p" : option to use to set port for ssh

 *g:netrw_sepchr* 	=\0xff
			=\0x01 for enc == euc-jp (and perhaps it should be for
			   others, too, please let me know)
			   Separates priority codes from filenames internally.
			   See |netrw-p12|.

  *g:netrw_silent*	=0 : transfers done normally
			=1 : transfers done silently

 *g:netrw_use_errorwindow* =1 : messages from netrw will use a separate one
			      line window.  This window provides reliable
			      delivery of messages. (default)
			 =0 : messages from netrw will use echoerr ;
			      messages don't always seem to show up this
			      way, but one doesn't have to quit the window.

 *g:netrw_win95ftp*	=1 if using Win95, will remove four trailing blank
			   lines that o/s's ftp "provides" on transfers
			=0 force normal ftp behavior (no trailing line removal)

 *g:netrw_cygwin* 	=1 assume scp under windows is from cygwin. Also
			   permits network browsing to use ls with time and
			   size sorting (default if windows)
			=0 assume Windows' scp accepts windows-style paths
			   Network browsing uses dir instead of ls
			   This option is ignored if you're using unix

 *g:netrw_use_nt_rcp*	=0 don't use the rcp of WinNT, Win2000 and WinXP
			=1 use WinNT's rcp in binary mode         (default)

PATHS							*netrw-path* {{{2

Paths to files are generally user-directory relative for most protocols.
It is possible that some protocol will make paths relative to some
associated directory, however.
>
	example:  vim scp://user@host/somefile
	example:  vim scp://user@host/subdir1/subdir2/somefile
<
where "somefile" is in the "user"'s home directory.  If you wish to get a
file using root-relative paths, use the full path:
>
	example:  vim scp://user@host//somefile
	example:  vim scp://user@host//subdir1/subdir2/somefile
<

==============================================================================
4. Network-Oriented File Transfer			*netrw-xfer* {{{1

Network-oriented file transfer under Vim is implemented by a VimL-based script
(<netrw.vim>) using plugin techniques.  It currently supports both reading and
writing across networks using rcp, scp, ftp or ftp+<.netrc>, scp, fetch,
dav/cadaver, rsync, or sftp.

http is currently supported read-only via use of wget or fetch.

<netrw.vim> is a standard plugin which acts as glue between Vim and the
various file transfer programs.  It uses autocommand events (BufReadCmd,
FileReadCmd, BufWriteCmd) to intercept reads/writes with url-like filenames. >

	ex. vim ftp://hostname/path/to/file
<
The characters preceding the colon specify the protocol to use; in the
example, it's ftp.  The <netrw.vim> script then formulates a command or a
series of commands (typically ftp) which it issues to an external program
(ftp, scp, etc) which does the actual file transfer/protocol.  Files are read
from/written to a temporary file (under Unix/Linux, /tmp/...) which the
<netrw.vim> script will clean up.

Now, a word about Jan Min's "FTP User Name and Password Disclosure"; first,
ftp is not a secure protocol.  User names and passwords are transmitted "in
the clear" over the internet; any snooper tool can pick these up; this is not
a netrw thing, this is a ftp thing.  If you're concerned about this, please
try to use scp or sftp instead.

Netrw re-uses the user id and password during the same vim session and so long
as the remote hostname remains the same.

Jan seems to be a bit confused about how netrw handles ftp; normally multiple
commands are performed in a "ftp session", and he seems to feel that the
uid/password should only be retained over one ftp session.  However, netrw
does every ftp operation in a separate "ftp session"; so remembering the
uid/password for just one "ftp session" would be the same as not remembering
the uid/password at all.  IMHO this would rapidly grow tiresome as one
browsed remote directories, for example.

On the other hand, thanks go to Jan M. for pointing out the many
vulnerabilities that netrw (and vim itself) had had in handling "crafted"
filenames.  The |shellescape()| and |fnameescape()| functions were written in
response by Bram Moolenaar to handle these sort of problems, and netrw has
been modified to use them.  Still, my advice is, if the "filename" looks like
a vim command that you aren't comfortable with having executed, don't open it.

				*netrw-putty* *netrw-pscp* *netrw-psftp*
One may modify any protocol's implementing external application by setting a
variable (ex. scp uses the variable g:netrw_scp_cmd, which is defaulted to
"scp -q").  As an example, consider using PuTTY: >

	let g:netrw_scp_cmd = '"c:\Program Files\PuTTY\pscp.exe" -q -batch'
	let g:netrw_sftp_cmd= '"c:\Program Files\PuTTY\psftp.exe"'
<
(note: it has been reported that windows 7 with putty v0.6's "-batch" option
       doesn't work, so its best to leave it off for that system)

See |netrw-p8| for more about putty, pscp, psftp, etc.

Ftp, an old protocol, seems to be blessed by numerous implementations.
Unfortunately, some implementations are noisy (ie., add junk to the end of the
file).  Thus, concerned users may decide to write a NetReadFixup() function
that will clean up after reading with their ftp.  Some Unix systems (ie.,
FreeBSD) provide a utility called "fetch" which uses the ftp protocol but is
not noisy and more convenient, actually, for <netrw.vim> to use.
Consequently, if "fetch" is available (ie. executable), it may be preferable
to use it for ftp://... based transfers.

For rcp, scp, sftp, and http, one may use network-oriented file transfers
transparently; ie.
>
	vim rcp://[user@]machine/path
	vim scp://[user@]machine/path
<
If your ftp supports <.netrc>, then it too can be transparently used
if the needed triad of machine name, user id, and password are present in
that file.  Your ftp must be able to use the <.netrc> file on its own, however.
>
	vim ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]portnumber]/path
<
Windows provides an ftp (typically c:\Windows\System32\ftp.exe) which uses
an option, -s:filename (filename can and probably should be a full path)
which contains ftp commands which will be automatically run whenever ftp
starts.  You may use this feature to enter a user and password for one site: >
	userid
	password
<				*netrw-windows-netrc*  *netrw-windows-s*
If |g:netrw_ftp_cmd| contains -s:[path/]MACHINE, then (on Windows machines
only) netrw will substitute the current machine name requested for ftp
connections for MACHINE.  Hence one can have multiple machine.ftp files
containing login and password for ftp.  Example: >

    let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= 'c:\Windows\System32\ftp -s:C:\Users\Myself\MACHINE'
    vim ftp://myhost.somewhere.net/

will use a file >

	C:\Users\Myself\myhost.ftp
<
Often, ftp will need to query the user for the userid and password.
The latter will be done "silently"; ie. asterisks will show up instead of
the actually-typed-in password.  Netrw will retain the userid and password
for subsequent read/writes from the most recent transfer so subsequent
transfers (read/write) to or from that machine will take place without
additional prompting.

  +=================================+============================+============+

	(*1) For an absolute path use scp://machine//path.

	(*2) if <.netrc> is present, it is assumed that it will
	work with your ftp client.  Otherwise the script will
	prompt for user-id and password.

        (*3) for ftp, "machine" may be machine#port or machine:port
	if a different port is needed than the standard ftp port

	(*4) for http:..., if wget is available it will be used.  Otherwise,
	if fetch is available it will be used.

Both the :Nread and the :Nwrite ex-commands can accept multiple filenames.


NETRC							*netrw-netrc*

The <.netrc> file, typically located in your home directory, contains lines
therein which map a hostname (machine name) to the user id and password you
prefer to use with it.

The typical syntax for lines in a <.netrc> file is given as shown below.
Ftp under Unix usually supports <.netrc>; ftp under Windows usually doesn't.
>
	machine {full machine name} login {user-id} password "{password}"
	default login {user-id} password "{password}"

Your ftp client must handle the use of <.netrc> on its own, but if the
<.netrc> file exists, an ftp transfer will not ask for the user-id or
password.

	Note:
	Since this file contains passwords, make very sure nobody else can
	read this file!  Most programs will refuse to use a .netrc that is
	readable for others.  Don't forget that the system administrator can
	still read the file!  Ie. for Linux/Unix: chmod 600 .netrc

Even though Windows' ftp clients typically do not support .netrc, netrw has
a work-around: see |netrw-windows-s|.


PASSWORD						*netrw-passwd*

The script attempts to get passwords for ftp invisibly using |inputsecret()|,
a built-in Vim function.  See |netrw-userpass| for how to change the password
after one has set it.

Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way for netrw to feed a password to
scp.  Thus every transfer via scp will require re-entry of the password.
However, |netrw-ssh-hack| can help with this problem.


==============================================================================
5. Activation						*netrw-activate* {{{1

Network-oriented file transfers are available by default whenever Vim's
|'nocompatible'| mode is enabled.  Netrw's script files reside in your
system's plugin, autoload, and syntax directories; just the
plugin/netrwPlugin.vim script is sourced automatically whenever you bring up
vim.  The main script in autoload/netrw.vim is only loaded when you actually
use netrw.  I suggest that, at a minimum, you have at least the following in
your <.vimrc> customization file: >

	set nocp
	if version >= 600
	  filetype plugin indent on
	endif
<

==============================================================================
6. Transparent Remote File Editing		*netrw-transparent* {{{1

Transparent file transfers occur whenever a regular file read or write
(invoked via an |:autocmd| for |BufReadCmd|, |BufWriteCmd|, or |SourceCmd|
events) is made.  Thus one may read, write, or source  files across networks
just as easily as if they were local files! >

	vim ftp://[user@]machine/path
	...
	:wq

See |netrw-activate| for more on how to encourage your vim to use plugins
such as netrw.


==============================================================================
7. Ex Commands						*netrw-ex* {{{1

The usual read/write commands are supported.  There are also a few
additional commands available.  Often you won't need to use Nwrite or
Nread as shown in |netrw-transparent| (ie. simply use >
  :e url
  :r url
  :w url
instead, as appropriate) -- see |netrw-urls|.  In the explanations
below, a {netfile} is an url to a remote file.

						*:Nwrite*  *:Nw*
:[range]Nw[rite]	Write the specified lines to the current
		file as specified in b:netrw_lastfile.
		(related: |netrw-nwrite|)

:[range]Nw[rite] {netfile} [{netfile}]...
		Write the specified lines to the {netfile}.

						*:Nread*   *:Nr*
:Nr[ead]	Read the lines from the file specified in b:netrw_lastfile
		into the current buffer.  (related: |netrw-nread|)

:Nr[ead] {netfile} {netfile}...
		Read the {netfile} after the current line.

						*:Nsource* *:Ns*
:Ns[ource] {netfile}
		Source the {netfile}.
		To start up vim using a remote .vimrc, one may use
		the following (all on one line) (tnx to Antoine Mechelynck) >
		vim -u NORC -N
		 --cmd "runtime plugin/netrwPlugin.vim"
		 --cmd "source scp://HOSTNAME/.vimrc"
<		 (related: |netrw-source|)

:call NetUserPass()				*NetUserPass()*
		If g:netrw_uid and s:netrw_passwd don't exist,
		this function will query the user for them.
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:call NetUserPass("userid")
		This call will set the g:netrw_uid and, if
		the password doesn't exist, will query the user for it.
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:call NetUserPass("userid","passwd")
		This call will set both the g:netrw_uid and s:netrw_passwd.
		The user-id and password are used by ftp transfers.  One may
		effectively remove the user-id and password by using empty
		strings (ie. "").
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:NetrwSettings  This command is described in |netrw-settings| -- used to
                display netrw settings and change netrw behavior.

8. Variables and Options		*netrw-var* *netrw-settings* {{{1

(also see: |netrw-options| |netrw-variables| |netrw-protocol|
           |netrw-browser-settings| |netrw-browser-options| )

The <netrw.vim> script provides several variables which act as options to
affect <netrw.vim>'s file transfer behavior.  These variables typically may be

								*netrw-ftp*

The g:netrw_..._cmd options (|g:netrw_ftp_cmd| and |g:netrw_sftp_cmd|)
specify the external program to use handle the ftp protocol.  They may
include command line options (such as -p for passive mode). Example: >

	let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= "ftp -p"
<
Browsing is supported by using the |g:netrw_list_cmd|; the substring
"HOSTNAME" will be changed via substitution with whatever the current request
is for a hostname.

Two options (|g:netrw_ftp| and |netrw-fixup|) both help with certain ftp's
that give trouble .  In order to best understand how to use these options if
ftp is giving you troubles, a bit of discussion is provided on how netrw does
ftp reads.

For ftp, netrw typically builds up lines of one of the following formats in a
temporary file:
>
  IF g:netrw_ftp !exists or is not 1     IF g:netrw_ftp exists and is 1
  ----------------------------------     ------------------------------
<
       open machine [port]                    open machine [port]
       user userid password                   userid password
       [g:netrw_ftpmode]                      password
       [g:netrw_ftpextracmd]                  [g:netrw_ftpmode]
       get filename tempfile                  [g:netrw_extracmd]
                                              get filename tempfile >
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<
The |g:netrw_ftpmode| and |g:netrw_ftpextracmd| are optional.

Netrw then executes the lines above by use of a filter:
>
	:%! {g:netrw_ftp_cmd} -i [-n]
<
where
	g:netrw_ftp_cmd is usually "ftp",
	-i tells ftp not to be interactive
	-n means don't use netrc and is used for Method #3 (ftp w/o <.netrc>)

If <.netrc> exists it will be used to avoid having to query the user for
userid and password.  The transferred file is put into a temporary file.
The temporary file is then read into the main editing session window that
requested it and the temporary file deleted.

If your ftp doesn't accept the "user" command and immediately just demands a
userid, then try putting "let netrw_ftp=1" in your <.vimrc>.

								*netrw-cadaver*
To handle the SSL certificate dialog for untrusted servers, one may pull
down the certificate and place it into /usr/ssl/cert.pem.  This operation
renders the server treatment as "trusted".

						*netrw-fixup* *netreadfixup*
If your ftp for whatever reason generates unwanted lines (such as AUTH
messages) you may write a NetReadFixup() function:

The NetReadFixup() function will be called if it exists and thus allows you to
customize your reading process.  As a further example, <netrw.vim> contains
just such a function to handle Windows 95 ftp.  For whatever reason, Windows
95's ftp dumps four blank lines at the end of a transfer, and so it is
desirable to automate their removal.  Here's some code taken from <netrw.vim>
itself:
>
    if has("win95") && g:netrw_win95ftp
     fun! NetReadFixup(method, line1, line2)
       if method == 3   " ftp (no <.netrc>)

INTRODUCTION TO BROWSING			*netrw-intro-browse* {{{2
	(Quick References: |netrw-quickmaps| |netrw-quickcoms|)

Netrw supports the browsing of directories on your local system and on remote
hosts; browsing includes listing files and directories, entering directories,
editing files therein, deleting files/directories, making new directories,
moving (renaming) files and directories, copying files and directories, etc.
One may mark files and execute any system command on them!  The Netrw browser
generally implements the previous explorer's maps and commands for remote
directories, although details (such as pertinent global variable names)
necessarily differ.  To browse a directory, simply "edit" it! >

	vim /your/directory/
	vim .
	vim c:\your\directory\
<
(Related topics: |netrw-cr|  |netrw-o|  |netrw-p| |netrw-P| |netrw-t|
                 |netrw-mf|  |netrw-mx| |netrw-D| |netrw-R| |netrw-v| )

The Netrw remote file and directory browser handles two protocols: ssh and
ftp.  The protocol in the url, if it is ftp, will cause netrw also to use ftp
in its remote browsing.  Specifying any other protocol will cause it to be
used for file transfers; but the ssh protocol will be used to do remote
browsing.

To use Netrw's remote directory browser, simply attempt to read a "file" with
a trailing slash and it will be interpreted as a request to list a directory:
>
	vim [protocol]://[user@]hostname/path/
<
where [protocol] is typically scp or ftp.  As an example, try: >

	vim ftp://ftp.home.vim.org/pub/vim/
<
For local directories, the trailing slash is not required.  Again, because it's
easy to miss: to browse remote directories, the url must terminate with a
slash!

If you'd like to avoid entering the password repeatedly for remote directory
listings with ssh or scp, see |netrw-ssh-hack|.  To avoid password entry with
ftp, see |netrw-netrc| (if your ftp supports it).

There are several things you can do to affect the browser's display of files:

	* To change the listing style, press the "i" key (|netrw-i|).
	  Currently there are four styles: thin, long, wide, and tree.
	  To make that change "permanent", see |g:netrw_liststyle|.

	* To hide files (don't want to see those xyz~ files anymore?) see
	  |netrw-ctrl-h|.

	* Press s to sort files by name, time, or size.

See |netrw-browse-cmds| for all the things you can do with netrw!

			*netrw-getftype* *netrw-filigree* *netrw-ftype*
The |getftype()| function is used to append a bit of filigree to indicate
filetype to locally listed files:

	directory  : /
	executable : *
	fifo       : |
	links      : @
	sockets    : =

The filigree also affects the |g:netrw_sort_sequence|.

BOOKMARKING A DIRECTORY	*netrw-mb* *netrw-bookmark* *netrw-bookmarks* {{{2

One may easily "bookmark" a directory by using >

	mb
<
Bookmarks are retained in between sessions in a $HOME/.netrwbook file, and are
kept in sorted order.

BROWSING						*netrw-cr* {{{2

Browsing is simple: move the cursor onto a file or directory of interest.
Hitting the <cr> (the return key) will select the file or directory.
Directories will themselves be listed, and files will be opened using the
protocol given in the original read request.

  CAVEAT: There are four forms of listing (see |netrw-i|).  Netrw assumes that
  two or more spaces delimit filenames and directory names for the long and
  wide listing formats.  Thus, if your filename or directory name has two or
  more sequential spaces embedded in it, or any trailing spaces, then you'll
  need to use the "thin" format to select it.

The |g:netrw_browse_split| option, which is zero by default, may be used to
cause the opening of files to be done in a new window or tab instead of the
default.  When the option is one or two, the splitting will be taken
horizontally or vertically, respectively.  When the option is set to three, a
<cr> will cause the file to appear in a new tab.


When using the gui (gvim), one may select a file by pressing the <leftmouse>
button.  In addition, if

 *|g:netrw_retmap| == 1      AND   (its default value is 0)
 * in a netrw-selected file, AND
 * the user doesn't already have a <2-leftmouse> mapping defined before
   netrw is loaded

then a doubly-clicked leftmouse button will return to the netrw browser
window.

Netrw attempts to speed up browsing, especially for remote browsing where one
may have to enter passwords, by keeping and re-using previously obtained
directory listing buffers.  The |g:netrw_fastbrowse| variable is used to
control this behavior; one may have slow browsing (no buffer re-use), medium
speed browsing (re-use directory buffer listings only for remote directories),
and fast browsing (re-use directory buffer listings as often as possible).
The price for such re-use is that when changes are made (such as new files
are introduced into a directory), the listing may become out-of-date.  One may
always refresh directory listing buffers by pressing ctrl-L (see
|netrw-ctrl-l|).

								*:netrw-s-cr*
    Squeezing the Current Tree-Listing Directory~
    When the tree listing style is enabled (see |netrw-i|) and one is using
    gvim, then the <s-cr> mapping may be used to squeeze (close) the
    directory currently containing the cursor.

BROWSING WITH A HORIZONTALLY SPLIT WINDOW	*netrw-o* *netrw-horiz* {{{2

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  However, the "o" map
allows one to open a new window to hold the new directory listing or file.  A
horizontal split is used.  (for vertical splitting, see |netrw-v|)

Normally, the o key splits the window horizontally with the new window and
cursor at the top.

BROWSING WITH A NEW TAB				*netrw-t*

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  The "t" map
allows one to open a new window holding the new directory listing or file in
a new tab.

If you'd like to have the new listing in a background tab, use |gT|.

BROWSING WITH A VERTICALLY SPLIT WINDOW			*netrw-v* {{{2

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  However, the "v" map
allows one to open a new window to hold the new directory listing or file.  A
vertical split is used.  (for horizontal splitting, see |netrw-o|)

Normally, the v key splits the window vertically with the new window and
cursor at the left.

There is only one tree listing buffer; using "v" on a displayed subdirectory
will split the screen, but the same buffer will be shown twice.

Related Actions: |netrw-cr| |netrw-o| |netrw-t| |netrw-v|
Associated setting variables:
   |g:netrw_altv|    control right/left splitting
   |g:netrw_winsize| control initial sizing


CHANGE LISTING STYLE  (THIN LONG WIDE TREE)   			*netrw-i* {{{2

The "i" map cycles between the thin, long, wide, and tree listing formats.

The thin listing format gives just the files' and directories' names.

The long listing is either based on the "ls" command via ssh for remote
directories or displays the filename, file size (in bytes), and the time and
date of last modification for local directories.  With the long listing
format, netrw is not able to recognize filenames which have trailing spaces.
Use the thin listing format for such files.

The wide listing format uses two or more contiguous spaces to delineate
filenames; when using that format, netrw won't be able to recognize or use
filenames which have two or more contiguous spaces embedded in the name or any
trailing spaces.  The thin listing format will, however, work with such files.
The wide listing format is the most compact.

The tree listing format has a top directory followed by files and directories
preceded by one or more "|"s, which indicate the directory depth.  One may
open and close directories by pressing the <cr> key while atop the directory
name.

One may make a preferred listing style your default; see |g:netrw_liststyle|.
As an example, by putting the following line in your .vimrc, >
	let g:netrw_liststyle= 4
the tree style will become your default listing style.

One typical way to use the netrw tree display is to: >

	vim .
	(use i until a tree display shows)
	navigate to a file
	v  (edit as desired in vertically split window)
	ctrl-w h  (to return to the netrw listing)
	P (edit newly selected file in the previous window)
	ctrl-w h  (to return to the netrw listing)
	P (edit newly selected file in the previous window)
	...etc...

CHANGE FILE PERMISSION						*netrw-gp* {{{2

"gp" will ask you for a new permission for the file named under the cursor.
Currently, this only works for local files.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_chgperm|


CHANGING TO A BOOKMARKED DIRECTORY			*netrw-gb*  {{{2

To change directory back to a bookmarked directory, use

	{cnt}gb

Any count may be used to reference any of the bookmarks.
Note that |netrw-qb| shows both bookmarks and history; to go
to a location stored in the history see |netrw-u| and |netrw-U|.

Related Topics:
	|netrw-mB| how to delete bookmarks
	|netrw-mb| how to make a bookmark
	|netrw-qb| how to list bookmarks


CHANGING TO A PREDECESSOR DIRECTORY		*netrw-u* *netrw-updir* {{{2

Every time you change to a new directory (new for the current session),
netrw will save the directory in a recently-visited directory history
list (unless |g:netrw_dirhistmax| is zero; by default, it's ten).  With the
"u" map, one can change to an earlier directory (predecessor).  To do
the opposite, see |netrw-U|.

The "u" map also accepts counts to go back in the history several slots.
For your convenience, |netrw-qb| lists the history number which can be
re-used in that count.

See |g:netrw_dirhistmax| for how to control the quantity of history stack
slots.


CHANGING TO A SUCCESSOR DIRECTORY		*netrw-U* *netrw-downdir* {{{2

With the "U" map, one can change to a later directory (successor).
This map is the opposite of the "u" map. (see |netrw-u|)  Use the
q map to list both the bookmarks and history. (see |netrw-qb|)

The "U" map also accepts counts to go forward in the history several slots.

See |g:netrw_dirhistmax| for how to control the quantity of history stack
slots.


CHANGING TREE TOP				*netrw-ntree* *:Ntree*

One may specify a new tree top for tree listings using >

	:Ntree [dirname]

Without a "dirname", the current line is used (and any leading depth
information is elided).
With a "dirname", the specified directory name is used.


NETRW CLEAN					*netrw-clean* *:NetrwClean*

With :NetrwClean one may easily remove netrw from one's home directory;
more precisely, from the first directory on your |'runtimepath'|.

With :NetrwClean!, netrw will remove netrw from all directories on your
|'runtimepath'|.

With either form of the command, netrw will first ask for confirmation
that the removal is in fact what you want to do.  If netrw doesn't have
permission to remove a file, it will issue an error message.

						*netrw-gx*
CUSTOMIZING BROWSING WITH A USER FUNCTION	*netrw-x* *netrw-handler* {{{2
						(also see |netrw_filehandler|)

Certain files, such as html, gif, jpeg, (word/office) doc, etc, files, are
best seen with a special handler (ie. a tool provided with your computer).
Netrw allows one to invoke such special handlers by: >

	* when Exploring, hit the "x" key
	* when editing, hit gx with the cursor atop the special filename
<	  (not available if the |g:netrw_nogx| variable exists)

Netrw determines which special handler by the following method:

  * if |g:netrw_browsex_viewer| exists, then it will be used to attempt to
    view files.  Examples of useful settings (place into your <.vimrc>): >

	:let g:netrw_browsex_viewer= "kfmclient exec"
<   or >
	:let g:netrw_browsex_viewer= "gnome-open"
<
    If g:netrw_browsex_viewer == '-', then netrwFileHandler() will be
    invoked first (see |netrw_filehandler|).

  * for Windows 32 or 64, the url and FileProtocolHandler dlls are used.
  * for Gnome (with gnome-open): gnome-open is used.
  * for KDE (with kfmclient)   : kfmclient is used.
  * for Mac OS X               : open is used.
  * otherwise the netrwFileHandler plugin is used.

The file's suffix is used by these various approaches to determine an
appropriate application to use to "handle" these files.  Such things as
OpenOffice (*.sfx), visualization (*.jpg, *.gif, etc), and PostScript (*.ps,
*.eps) can be handled.

							*netrw_filehandler*

The "x" map applies a function to a file, based on its extension.  Of course,
the handler function must exist for it to be called!
>
 Ex. mypgm.html   x ->
                  NFH_html("scp://user@host/some/path/mypgm.html")
<
Users may write their own netrw File Handler functions to support more
suffixes with special handling.  See <autoload/netrwFileHandlers.vim> for
examples on how to make file handler functions.   As an example: >

	" NFH_suffix(filename)
	fun! NFH_suffix(filename)
	..do something special with filename..
	endfun
<
These functions need to be defined in some file in your .vim/plugin
(vimfiles\plugin) directory.  Vim's function names may not have punctuation
characters (except for the underscore) in them.  To support suffices that
contain such characters, netrw will first convert the suffix using the
following table: >

    @ -> AT       ! -> EXCLAMATION    % -> PERCENT
    : -> COLON    = -> EQUAL          ? -> QUESTION
    , -> COMMA    - -> MINUS          ; -> SEMICOLON
    $ -> DOLLAR   + -> PLUS           ~ -> TILDE

DELETING FILES OR DIRECTORIES	*netrw-delete* *netrw-D* *netrw-del* {{{2

If files have not been marked with |netrw-mf|:   (local marked file list)

    Deleting/removing files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
    file/directory to be deleted and pressing "D".  Directories must be empty
    first before they can be successfully removed.  If the directory is a
    softlink to a directory, then netrw will make two requests to remove the
    directory before succeeding.  Netrw will ask for confirmation before doing
    the removal(s).  You may select a range of lines with the "V" command
    (visual selection), and then pressing "D".

If files have been marked with |netrw-mf|:   (local marked file list)

    Marked files (and empty directories) will be deleted; again, you'll be
    asked to confirm the deletion before it actually takes place.

A further approach is to delete files which match a pattern.

    * use  :MF pattern  (see |netrw-:MF|); then press "D".

    * use mr (see |netrw-mr|) which will prompt you for pattern.
      This will cause the matching files to be marked.  Then,
      press "D".

The |g:netrw_rm_cmd|, |g:netrw_rmf_cmd|, and |g:netrw_rmdir_cmd| variables are
used to control the attempts to remove remote files and directories.  The
g:netrw_rm_cmd is used with files, and its default value is:

	g:netrw_rm_cmd: ssh HOSTNAME rm

The g:netrw_rmdir_cmd variable is used to support the removal of directories.
Its default value is:

	|g:netrw_rmdir_cmd|: ssh HOSTNAME rmdir

If removing a directory fails with g:netrw_rmdir_cmd, netrw then will attempt
to remove it again using the g:netrw_rmf_cmd variable.  Its default value is:

	|g:netrw_rmf_cmd|: ssh HOSTNAME rm -f

     :Nexplore............. go to next matching file                *:Nexplore*
     :Pexplore............. go to previous matching file            *:Pexplore*

						*netrw-:Explore*
:Explore  will open the local-directory browser on the current file's
          directory (or on directory [dir] if specified).  The window will be
	  split only if the file has been modified, otherwise the browsing
	  window will take over that window.  Normally the splitting is taken
	  horizontally.
	  Also see: |netrw-:Rexplore|
:Explore! is like :Explore, but will use vertical splitting.
						*netrw-:Lexplore*
:Lexplore [dir] toggles an Explorer window on the left hand side
          of the current tab  It will open a netrw window on the current
	  directory if [dir] is omitted; a :Lexplore [dir] will show
	  the specified directory in the left-hand side browser display
	  no matter from which window the command is issued.  By default,
	  :Lexplore will change an uninitialized |g:netrw_chgwin| to 2;
	  edits will thus be preferentially made in window#2.
	  Also see: |netrw-C|| |g:netrw_chgwin| |g:netrw_winsize|
	  	    |netrw-p| |netrw-P|| |g:netrw_browse_split|
						*netrw-:Sexplore*
:Sexplore will always split the window before invoking the local-directory
          browser.  As with Explore, the splitting is normally done
	  horizontally.
:Sexplore! [dir] is like :Sexplore, but the splitting will be done vertically.
						*netrw-:Hexplore*
:Hexplore  [dir] does an :Explore with |:belowright| horizontal splitting.
:Hexplore! [dir] does an :Explore with |:aboveleft|  horizontal splitting.
						*netrw-:Vexplore*
:Vexplore  [dir] does an :Explore with |:leftabove|  vertical splitting.
:Vexplore! [dir] does an :Explore with |:rightbelow| vertical splitting.
						*netrw-:Texplore*
:Texplore  [dir] does a |:tabnew| before generating the browser window

By default, these commands use the current file's directory.  However, one may
explicitly provide a directory (path) to use.

The [N] will override |g:netrw_winsize| to specify the quantity of rows and/or
columns the new explorer window should have.

Otherwise, the |g:netrw_winsize| variable, if it has been specified by the
user, is used to control the quantity of rows and/or columns new explorer
windows should have.

						*netrw-:Rexplore*
:Rexplore  This command is a little different from the others as it doesn't
	   necessarily open an Explorer window.

	   Return to Explorer~
	   When one edits a file, for example by pressing <cr> when the
	   cursor is atop a file in a netrw browser window, :Rexplore will
	   return the display to that of the last netrw browser display
	   in that window.

	   Return from Explorer~
	   Conversely, when one is editing a directory, issuing a :Rexplore
	   will return to editing the file that was last edited in that
	   window.

	   The <2-leftmouse> map (which is only available under gvim and
	   cooperative terms) does the same as :Rexplore.

*netrw-star* *netrw-starpat* *netrw-starstar* *netrw-starstarpat*
EXPLORING WITH STARS AND PATTERNS

When Explore, Sexplore, Hexplore, or Vexplore are used with one of the
following four styles, Explore generates a list of files which satisfy
the request. >

    */filepat	files in current directory which satisfy filepat
    **/filepat	files in current directory or below which satisfy the
		file pattern
    *//pattern	files in the current directory which contain the
		pattern (vimgrep is used)
    **//pattern	files in the current directory or below which contain
		the pattern (vimgrep is used)
<
The cursor will be placed on the first file in the list.  One may then
continue to go to subsequent files on that list via |:Nexplore| or to
preceding files on that list with |:Pexplore|.  Explore will update the
directory and place the cursor appropriately.

A plain >
	:Explore
will clear the explore list.

If your console or gui produces recognizable shift-up or shift-down sequences,
then you'll likely find using shift-downarrow and shift-uparrow convenient.
They're mapped by netrw:

	<s-down>  == Nexplore, and
	<s-up>    == Pexplore.

As an example, consider
>
	:Explore */*.c
	:Nexplore
	:Nexplore
	:Pexplore

With the cursor atop a filename, pressing "qf" will reveal the file's size
and last modification timestamp.  Currently this capability is only available
for local files.


EDIT FILE OR DIRECTORY HIDING LIST	*netrw-ctrl-h* *netrw-edithide* {{{2

The "<ctrl-h>" map brings up a requestor allowing the user to change the
file/directory hiding list contained in |g:netrw_list_hide|.  The hiding list
consists of one or more patterns delimited by commas.  Files and/or
directories satisfying these patterns will either be hidden (ie. not shown) or
be the only ones displayed (see |netrw-a|).

The "gh" mapping (see |netrw-gh|) quickly alternates between the usual
hiding list and the hiding of files or directories that begin with ".".

As an example, >
	let g:netrw_list_hide= '\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'
Effectively, this makes the effect of a |netrw-gh| command the initial setting.
What it means:

	\(^\|\s\s\)   : if the line begins with the following, -or-
	                two consecutive spaces are encountered
	\zs           : start the hiding match now
	\.            : if it now begins with a dot
	\S\+          : and is followed by one or more non-whitespace
	                characters

					*netrw-sort-sequence*
EDITING THE SORTING SEQUENCE		*netrw-S* *netrw-sortsequence* {{{2

When "Sorted by" is name, one may specify priority via the sorting sequence
(g:netrw_sort_sequence).  The sorting sequence typically prioritizes the
name-listing by suffix, although any pattern will do.  Patterns are delimited
by commas.  The default sorting sequence is (all one line):

For Unix: >
	'[\/]$,\<core\%(\.\d\+\)\=,\.[a-np-z]$,\.h$,\.c$,\.cpp$,*,\.o$,\.obj$,
	\.info$,\.swp$,\.bak$,\~$'
<
Otherwise: >
	'[\/]$,\.[a-np-z]$,\.h$,\.c$,\.cpp$,*,\.o$,\.obj$,\.info$,
	\.swp$,\.bak$,\~$'
<
The lone * is where all filenames not covered by one of the other patterns
will end up.  One may change the sorting sequence by modifying the
g:netrw_sort_sequence variable (either manually or in your <.vimrc>) or by
using the "S" map.

EXECUTING FILE UNDER CURSOR VIA SYSTEM()			*netrw-X*

Pressing X while the cursor is atop an executable file will yield a prompt
using the filename asking for any arguments.  Upon pressing a [return], netrw
will then call |system()| with that command and arguments.  The result will
be displayed by |:echomsg|, and so |:messages| will repeat display of the
result.  Ansi escape sequences will be stripped out.


FORCING TREATMENT AS A FILE OR DIRECTORY	*netrw-gd* *netrw-gf* {{{2

Remote symbolic links (ie. those listed via ssh or ftp) are problematic
in that it is difficult to tell whether they link to a file or to a
directory.

To force treatment as a file: use >
	gf
<
To force treatment as a directory: use >
	gd
<

GOING UP							*netrw--* {{{2

To go up a directory, press "-" or press the <cr> when atop the ../ directory
entry in the listing.

Netrw will use the command in |g:netrw_list_cmd| to perform the directory
listing operation after changing HOSTNAME to the host specified by the
user-prpvided url.  By default netrw provides the command as: >

	ssh HOSTNAME ls -FLa
<
where the HOSTNAME becomes the [user@]hostname as requested by the attempt to
read.  Naturally, the user may override this command with whatever is
preferred.  The NetList function which implements remote browsing
expects that directories will be flagged by a trailing slash.


HIDING FILES OR DIRECTORIES			*netrw-a* *netrw-hiding* {{{2

Netrw's browsing facility allows one to use the hiding list in one of three
ways: ignore it, hide files which match, and show only those files which
match.

If no files have been marked via |netrw-mf|:

The "a" map allows the user to cycle through the three hiding modes.

The |g:netrw_list_hide| variable holds a comma delimited list of patterns
based on regular expressions (ex. ^.*\.obj$,^\.) which specify the hiding list.
(also see |netrw-ctrl-h|)  To set the hiding list, use the <c-h> map.  As an
example, to hide files which begin with a ".", one may use the <c-h> map to
set the hiding list to '^\..*' (or one may put let g:netrw_list_hide= '^\..*'
in one's <.vimrc>).  One may then use the "a" key to show all files, hide
matching files, or to show only the matching files.

	Example: \.[ch]$
		This hiding list command will hide/show all *.c and *.h files.

	Example: \.c$,\.h$
		This hiding list command will also hide/show all *.c and *.h
		files.

Don't forget to use the "a" map to select the mode (normal/hiding/show) you
want!

If files have been marked using |netrw-mf|, then this command will:

  if showing all files or non-hidden files:
   modify the g:netrw_list_hide list by appending the marked files to it
   and showing only non-hidden files.

  else if showing hidden files only:
   modify the g:netrw_list_hide list by removing the marked files from it
   and showing only non-hidden files.
  endif

					*netrw-gitignore*
Netrw provides a helper function 'netrw_gitignore#Hide()' that, when used with
|g:netrw_list_hide| automatically hides all git-ignored files.

'netrw_gitignore#Hide' searches for patterns in the following files:
	'./.gitignore'
	'./.git/info/exclude'
	global gitignore file: `git config --global core.excludesfile`
	system gitignore file: `git config --system core.excludesfile`

Files that do not exist, are ignored.
Git-ignore patterns are taken from existing files, and converted to patterns for
hiding files. For example, if you had '*.log' in your '.gitignore' file, it
would be converted to '.*\.log'.

To use this function, simply assign it's output to |g:netrw_list_hide| option.

	Example: let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide()
		Git-ignored files are hidden in Netrw.

	Example: let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide('my_gitignore_file')
		Function can take additional files with git-ignore patterns.

	Example: g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide() . '.*\.swp$'
		Combining 'netrw_gitignore#Hide' with custom patterns.


IMPROVING BROWSING			*netrw-listhack* *netrw-ssh-hack* {{{2

Especially with the remote directory browser, constantly entering the password
is tedious.

For Linux/Unix systems, the book "Linux Server Hacks - 100 industrial strength
tips & tools" by Rob Flickenger (O'Reilly, ISBN 0-596-00461-3) gives a tip
for setting up no-password ssh and scp and discusses associated security
issues.  It used to be available at http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/66 ,
but apparently that address is now being redirected to some "hackzine".
I'll attempt a summary based on that article and on a communication from
Ben Schmidt:

	1. Generate a public/private key pair on the local machine
	   (ssh client): >
		ssh-keygen -t rsa
		(saving the file in ~/.ssh/id_rsa as prompted)
<
	2. Just hit the <CR> when asked for passphrase (twice) for no
	   passphrase.  If you do use a passphrase, you will also need to use
	   ssh-agent so you only have to type the passphrase once per session.
	   If you don't use a passphrase, simply logging onto your local
	   computer or getting access to the keyfile in any way will suffice
	   to access any ssh servers which have that key authorized for login.

	3. This creates two files: >
		~/.ssh/id_rsa
		~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
	4. On the target machine (ssh server): >
		cd
		mkdir -p .ssh
		chmod 0700 .ssh
<
	5. On your local machine (ssh client): (one line) >
		ssh {serverhostname}
		  cat '>>' '~/.ssh/authorized_keys2' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
	   or, for OpenSSH, (one line) >
		ssh {serverhostname}
		  cat '>>' '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
You can test it out with >
	ssh {serverhostname}
and you should be log onto the server machine without further need to type
anything.

If you decided to use a passphrase, do: >
	ssh-agent $SHELL
	ssh-add
	ssh {serverhostname}
You will be prompted for your key passphrase when you use ssh-add, but not
subsequently when you use ssh.  For use with vim, you can use >
	ssh-agent vim
and, when next within vim, use >
	:!ssh-add
Alternatively, you can apply ssh-agent to the terminal you're planning on
running vim in: >
	ssh-agent xterm &
and do ssh-add whenever you need.

For Windows, folks on the vim mailing list have mentioned that Pageant helps
with avoiding the constant need to enter the password.

Kingston Fung wrote about another way to avoid constantly needing to enter
passwords:

    In order to avoid the need to type in the password for scp each time, you
    provide a hack in the docs to set up a non password ssh account. I found a
    better way to do that: I can use a regular ssh account which uses a
    password to access the material without the need to key-in the password
    each time. It's good for security and convenience. I tried ssh public key
    authorization + ssh-agent, implementing this, and it works! Here are two
    links with instructions:

MAKING A NEW DIRECTORY					*netrw-d* {{{2

With the "d" map one may make a new directory either remotely (which depends
on the global variable g:netrw_mkdir_cmd) or locally (which depends on the
global variable g:netrw_localmkdir).  Netrw will issue a request for the new
directory's name.  A bare <CR> at that point will abort the making of the
directory.  Attempts to make a local directory that already exists (as either
a file or a directory) will be detected, reported on, and ignored.

MAKING THE BROWSING DIRECTORY THE CURRENT DIRECTORY	*netrw-c* {{{2

By default, |g:netrw_keepdir| is 1.  This setting means that the current
directory will not track the browsing directory. (done for backwards
compatibility with v6's file explorer).

Setting g:netrw_keepdir to 0 tells netrw to make vim's current directory
track netrw's browsing directory.

However, given the default setting for g:netrw_keepdir of 1 where netrw
maintains its own separate notion of the current directory, in order to make
the two directories the same, use the "c" map (just type c).  That map will
set Vim's notion of the current directory to netrw's current browsing
directory.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_keepdir|

MARKING FILES					*netrw-:MF*	*netrw-mf* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mr|)

Netrw has several ways of marking files:

	* One may mark files with the cursor atop a filename and
	  then pressing "mf".

	* With gvim, in addition one may mark files with
	  <s-leftmouse>. (see |netrw-mouse|)

	* One may use the :MF command, which takes a list of
	  files (for local directories, the list may include
	  wildcards -- see |glob()|) >

		:MF *.c
<
	* Note that :MF uses |<f-args>| to break the line
	  at spaces.

	* Mark files based upon the quickfix list (|netrw-qF|)

The following netrw maps make use of marked files:

    |netrw-a|	Hide marked files/directories
    |netrw-D|	Delete marked files/directories
    |netrw-mc|	Copy marked files to target
    |netrw-md|	Apply vimdiff to marked files
    |netrw-me|	Edit marked files
    |netrw-mF|	Unmark marked files
    |netrw-mg|	Apply vimgrep to marked files
    |netrw-mm|	Move marked files to target
    |netrw-mp|	Print marked files
    |netrw-mt|	Set target for |netrw-mm| and |netrw-mc|
    |netrw-mT|	Generate tags using marked files
    |netrw-mx|	Apply shell command to marked files
    |netrw-mz|	Compress/Decompress marked files
    |netrw-O|	Obtain marked files
    |netrw-R|	Rename marked files

One may unmark files one at a time the same way one marks them; ie. place
the cursor atop a marked file and press "mf".  This process also works
with <s-leftmouse> using gvim.  One may unmark all files by pressing
"mu" (see |netrw-mu|).

Marked files are highlighted using the "netrwMarkFile" highlighting group,
which by default is linked to "Identifier" (see Identifier under
|group-name|).  You may change the highlighting group by putting something
like >

	highlight clear netrwMarkFile
	hi link netrwMarkFile ..whatever..
<
into $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/netrw.vim .

If the mouse is enabled and works with your vim, you may use <s-leftmouse> to
mark one or more files.  You may mark multiple files by dragging the shifted
leftmouse.  (see |netrw-mouse|)

*markfilelist* *global_markfilelist* *local_markfilelist*
All marked files are entered onto the global marked file list; there is only
one such list.  In addition, every netrw buffer also has its own local marked
file list; since netrw buffers are associated with specific directories, this
means that each directory has its own local marked file list.  The various
commands which operate on marked files use one or the other of the marked file
lists.

Known Problem: if one is using tree mode (|g:netrw_liststyle|) and several
directories have files with the same name,  then marking such a file will
result in all such files being highlighted as if they were all marked.  The
|markfilelist|, however, will only have the selected file in it.  This problem
is unlikely to be fixed.


UNMARKING FILES							*netrw-mF* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

This command will unmark all files in the current buffer.  One may also use
mf (|netrw-mf|) on a specific file to unmark just that file.


MARKING FILES BY QUICKFIX LIST				*netrw-qF*
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

One may convert the |quickfix-error-lists| into a marked file list using
"qF".  You may then proceed with commands such as me (|netrw-me|) to
edit them.  Quickfix error lists are generated, for example, by calls
to |:vimgrep|.


MARKING FILES BY REGULAR EXPRESSION				*netrw-mr* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

One may also mark files by pressing "mr"; netrw will then issue a prompt,
"Enter regexp: ".  You may then enter a shell-style regular expression such
as *.c$ (see |glob()|).  For remote systems, glob() doesn't work -- so netrw
converts "*" into ".*" (see |regexp|) and marks files based on that.  In the
future I may make it possible to use |regexp|s instead of glob()-style
expressions (yet-another-option).


MARKED FILES: ARBITRARY COMMAND				*netrw-mx* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked-file list)

Upon activation of the "mx" map, netrw will query the user for some (external)
command to be applied to all marked files.  All "%"s in the command will be
substituted with the name of each marked file in turn.  If no "%"s are in the
command, then the command will be followed by a space and a marked filename.


MARKED FILES: COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION		*netrw-mz* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

If any marked files are compressed,   then "mz" will decompress them.
If any marked files are decompressed, then "mz" will compress them
using the command specified by |g:netrw_compress|; by default,
that's "gzip".

For decompression, netrw provides a |Dictionary| of suffices and their
associated decompressing utilities; see |g:netrw_decompress|.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_compress| |g:netrw_decompress|

MARKED FILES: COPYING						*netrw-mc* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (Uses the global marked file list)

Select a target directory with mt (|netrw-mt|).  Then change directory,
select file(s) (see |netrw-mf|), and press "mc".  The copy is done
from the current window (where one does the mf) to the target.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_localcopycmd| |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: DIFF						*netrw-md* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

Use |vimdiff| to visualize difference between selected files (two or
three may be selected for this).  Uses the global marked file list.

MARKED FILES: EDITING						*netrw-me* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

This command will place the marked files on the |arglist| and commence
editing them.  One may return the to explorer window with |:Rexplore|.
(use |:n| and |:p| to edit next and previous files in the arglist)

MARKED FILES: GREP						*netrw-mg* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

This command will apply |:vimgrep| to the marked files.
The command will ask for the requested pattern; one may then enter: >

	/pattern/[g][j]
	! /pattern/[g][j]
	pattern
<
In the cases of "j" option usage as shown above, "mg" will winnow the current
marked file list to just those possessing the specified pattern.
Thus, one may use >
	mr ...file-pattern
	mg ..contents-pattern
to have a marked file list satisfying the file-pattern but containing the
desried contents-pattern.

MARKED FILES: HIDING AND UNHIDING BY SUFFIX			*netrw-mh* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

This command extracts the suffices of the marked files and toggles their
presence on the hiding list.  Please note that marking the same suffix
this way multiple times will result in the suffix's presence being toggled
for each file (so an even quantity of marked files having the same suffix
is the same as not having bothered to select them at all).

MARKED FILES: MOVING						*netrw-mm* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

	WARNING: moving files is more dangerous than copying them.
	A file being moved is first copied and then deleted; if the
	copy operation fails and the delete succeeds, you will lose
	the file.  Either try things out with unimportant files
	first or do the copy and then delete yourself using mc and D.
	Use at your own risk!

Select a target directory with mt (|netrw-mt|).  Then change directory,
select file(s) (see |netrw-mf|), and press "mm".  The move is done
from the current window (where one does the mf) to the target.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_localmovecmd| |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: PRINTING						*netrw-mp* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

Netrw will apply the |:hardcopy| command to marked files.  What it does
is open each file in a one-line window, execute hardcopy, then close the
one-line window.


MARKED FILES: SOURCING						*netrw-ms* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

Netrw will source the marked files (using vim's |:source| command)


MARKED FILES: SETTING THE TARGET DIRECTORY			*netrw-mt* {{{2
     (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)

Set the marked file copy/move-to target (see |netrw-mc| and |netrw-mm|):

  * If the cursor is atop a file name, then the netrw window's currently
    displayed directory is used for the copy/move-to target.

  * Also, if the cursor is in the banner, then the netrw window's currently
    displayed directory is used for the copy/move-to target.
    Unless the target already is the current directory.  In which case,
    remove the target.

  * However, if the cursor is atop a directory name, then that directory is
    used for the copy/move-to target

  * One may use the :MT [directory] command to set the target	*netrw-:MT*
    This command uses |<q-args>|, so spaces in the directory name are
    permitted without escaping.

There is only one copy/move-to target per vim session; ie. the target is a
script variable (see |s:var|) and is shared between all netrw windows (in an
instance of vim).

When using menus and gvim, netrw provides a "Targets" entry which allows one
to pick a target from the list of bookmarks and history.

MARKED FILES: TAGGING						*netrw-mT* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

The "mT" mapping will apply the command in |g:netrw_ctags| (by default, it is
"ctags") to marked files.  For remote browsing, in order to create a tags file
netrw will use ssh (see |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|), and so ssh must be available for
this to work on remote systems.  For your local system, see |ctags| on how to
get a version.  I myself use hdrtags, currently available at
http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/src/index.html , and have >

	let g:netrw_ctags= "hdrtag"
<
in my <.vimrc>.

When a remote set of files are tagged, the resulting tags file is "obtained";
ie. a copy is transferred to the local system's directory.  The now local tags
file is then modified so that one may use it through the network.  The
modification made concerns the names of the files in the tags; each filename is
preceded by the netrw-compatible url used to obtain it.  When one subsequently
uses one of the go to tag actions (|tags|), the url will be used by netrw to
edit the desired file and go to the tag.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_ctags| |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: TARGET DIRECTORY USING BOOKMARKS  		*netrw-Tb* {{{2

Sets the marked file copy/move-to target.

The |netrw-qb| map will give you a list of bookmarks (and history).
One may choose one of the bookmarks to become your marked file
target by using [count]Tb (default count: 1).

Sets the marked file copy/move-to target.

The |netrw-qb| map will give you a list of history (and bookmarks).
One may choose one of the history entries to become your marked file
target by using [count]Th (default count: 0; ie. the current directory).

NETRW BROWSER VARIABLES		*netrw-browser-options* *netrw-browser-var* {{{2

(if you're interested in the netrw file transfer settings, see |netrw-options|
 and |netrw-protocol|)

The <netrw.vim> browser provides settings in the form of variables which
you may modify; by placing these settings in your <.vimrc>, you may customize
your browsing preferences.  (see also: |netrw-settings|)
>
   ---				-----------
   Var				Explanation
   ---				-----------
<  *g:netrw_altfile*		some like |CTRL-^| to return to the last
				edited file.  Choose that by setting this
				parameter to 1.
				Others like |CTRL-^| to return to the
				netrw browsing buffer.  Choose that by setting
				this parameter to 0.
				 default: =0

  *g:netrw_alto*		change from above splitting to below splitting
				by setting this variable (see |netrw-o|)
				 default: =&sb           (see |'sb'|)

  *g:netrw_altv*		change from left splitting to right splitting
				by setting this variable (see |netrw-v|)
				 default: =&spr          (see |'spr'|)

  *g:netrw_banner*		enable/suppress the banner
				=0: suppress the banner
				=1: banner is enabled (default)
				NOTE: suppressing the banner is a new feature
				which may cause problems.

  *g:netrw_bannerbackslash*	if this variable exists and is not zero, the
				banner will be displayed with backslashes
				rather than forward slashes.

  *g:netrw_browse_split*	when browsing, <cr> will open the file by:
				=0: re-using the same window
				=1: horizontally splitting the window first
				=2: vertically   splitting the window first
				=3: open file in new tab
				=4: act like "P" (ie. open previous window)
				    Note that |g:netrw_preview| may be used
				    to get vertical splitting instead of
				    horizontal splitting.

  *g:netrw_browsex_viewer*	specify user's preference for a viewer: >
					"kfmclient exec"
					"gnome-open"
<				If >
					"-"
<				is used, then netrwFileHandler() will look for
				a script/function to handle the given
				extension.  (see |netrw_filehandler|).

  *g:netrw_chgperm*		Unix/Linux: "chmod PERM FILENAME"
				Windows:    "cacls FILENAME /e /p PERM"
				Used to change access permission for a file.

  *g:netrw_compress*		="gzip"
				    Will compress marked files with this
				    command

  *g:Netrw_corehandler*		Allows one to specify something additional
				to do when handling <core> files via netrw's
				browser's "x" command (see |netrw-x|).  If
				present, g:Netrw_corehandler specifies
				either one or more function references
				(see |Funcref|).  (the capital g:Netrw...
				is required its holding a function reference)


  *g:netrw_ctags*		="ctags"
				The default external program used to create
				tags

  *g:netrw_cursor*		= 2 (default)
  				This option controls the use of the
				|'cursorline'| (cul) and |'cursorcolumn'|
				(cuc) settings by netrw:

				Value   Thin-Long-Tree      Wide
				 =0      u-cul u-cuc      u-cul u-cuc
				 =1      u-cul u-cuc        cul u-cuc
				 =2        cul u-cuc        cul u-cuc
				 =3        cul u-cuc        cul   cuc
				 =4        cul   cuc        cul   cuc

				Where
				  u-cul : user's |'cursorline'|   setting used
				  u-cuc : user's |'cursorcolumn'| setting used
				  cul   : |'cursorline'|  locally set
				  cuc   : |'cursorcolumn'| locally set

  *g:netrw_decompress*		= { ".gz"  : "gunzip" ,
				    ".bz2" : "bunzip2" ,
				    ".zip" : "unzip" ,
				    ".tar" : "tar -xf"}
				  A dictionary mapping suffices to
				  decompression programs.

  *g:netrw_dirhistmax*            =10: controls maximum quantity of past
                                     history.  May be zero to supppress
				     history.
				     (related: |netrw-qb| |netrw-u| |netrw-U|)

  *g:netrw_dynamic_maxfilenamelen* =32: enables dynamic determination of
				    |g:netrw_maxfilenamelen|, which affects
				    local file long listing.

  *g:netrw_errorlvl*		=0: error levels greater than or equal to
				    this are permitted to be displayed
				    0: notes
				    1: warnings
				    2: errors

  *g:netrw_fastbrowse*		=0: slow speed directory browsing;
				    never re-uses directory listings;
				    always obtains directory listings.
				=1: medium speed directory browsing;
				    re-use directory listings only
				    when remote directory browsing.
				    (default value)
				=2: fast directory browsing;
				    only obtains directory listings when the
				    directory hasn't been seen before
				    (or |netrw-ctrl-l| is used).

				Fast browsing retains old directory listing
				buffers so that they don't need to be
				re-acquired.  This feature is especially
				important for remote browsing.  However, if
				a file is introduced or deleted into or from
				such directories, the old directory buffer
				becomes out-of-date.  One may always refresh
				such a directory listing with |netrw-ctrl-l|.
				This option gives the user the choice of
				trading off accuracy (ie. up-to-date listing)
				versus speed.

  *g:netrw_ffkeep*		(default: doesn't exist)
  				If this variable exists and is zero, then
				netrw will not do a save and restore for
				|'fileformat'|.

  *g:netrw_fname_escape*	=' ?&;%'
				Used on filenames before remote reading/writing

  *g:netrw_ftp_browse_reject*	ftp can produce a number of errors and warnings
				that can show up as "directories" and "files"
				in the listing.  This pattern is used to
				remove such embedded messages.  By default its
				value is:
				 '^total\s\+\d\+$\|
				 ^Trying\s\+\d\+.*$\|
				 ^KERBEROS_V\d rejected\|
				 ^Security extensions not\|
				 No such file\|
				 : connect to address [0-9a-fA-F:]*
				 : No route to host$'

  *g:netrw_ftp_list_cmd*	options for passing along to ftp for directory
				listing.  Defaults:
				 unix or g:netrw_cygwin set: : "ls -lF"
				 otherwise                     "dir"


  *g:netrw_ftp_sizelist_cmd*	options for passing along to ftp for directory
				listing, sorted by size of file.
				Defaults:
				 unix or g:netrw_cygwin set: : "ls -slF"
				 otherwise                     "dir"

  *g:netrw_ftp_timelist_cmd*	options for passing along to ftp for directory
				listing, sorted by time of last modification.
				Defaults:
				 unix or g:netrw_cygwin set: : "ls -tlF"
				 otherwise                     "dir"

  *g:netrw_glob_escape*		='[]*?`{~$'  (unix)
				='[]*?`{$'  (windows
				These characters in directory names are
				escaped before applying glob()

  *g:netrw_hide*		Controlled by the "a" map (see |netrw-a|)
				=0 : show all
				=1 : show not-hidden files
				=2 : show hidden files only
				 default: =0

  *g:netrw_home*		The home directory for where bookmarks and
				history are saved (as .netrwbook and
				.netrwhist).
				 default: the first directory on the
				         |'runtimepath'|

  *g:netrw_keepdir*		=1 (default) keep current directory immune from
				   the browsing directory.
				=0 keep the current directory the same as the
				   browsing directory.
				The current browsing directory is contained in
				b:netrw_curdir (also see |netrw-c|)

  *g:netrw_list_cmd*		command for listing remote directories
				 default: (if ssh is executable)
				          "ssh HOSTNAME ls -FLa"

  *g:netrw_liststyle*		Set the default listing style:
                                = 0: thin listing (one file per line)
                                = 1: long listing (one file per line with time
				     stamp information and file size)
				= 2: wide listing (multiple files in columns)
				= 3: tree style listing

  *g:netrw_list_hide*		comma separated pattern list for hiding files
				Patterns are regular expressions (see |regexp|)
				There's some special support for git-ignore
				files: you may add the output from the helper
				function 'netrw_gitignore#Hide() automatically
				hiding all gitignored files.
				For more details see |netrw-gitignore|.

				Examples:
				 let g:netrw_list_hide= '.*\.swp$'
         			 let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide().'.*\.swp$'
				default: ""

  *g:netrw_localcopycmd*	="cp" Linux/Unix/MacOS/Cygwin
				="copy" Windows
				Copies marked files (|netrw-mf|) to target
				directory (|netrw-mt|, |netrw-mc|)

  *g:netrw_localmkdir*		command for making a local directory
				 default: "mkdir"

  *g:netrw_localmovecmd*	="mv" Linux/Unix/MacOS/Cygwin
				="move" Windows
				Moves marked files (|netrw-mf|) to target
				directory (|netrw-mt|, |netrw-mm|)

  *g:netrw_localrmdir*		remove directory command (rmdir)
				 default: "rmdir"

  *g:netrw_maxfilenamelen*	=32 by default, selected so as to make long
				    listings fit on 80 column displays.
				If your screen is wider, and you have file
				or directory names longer than 32 bytes,
				you may set this option to keep listings
				columnar.

  *g:netrw_mkdir_cmd*		command for making a remote directory
				via ssh  (also see |g:netrw_remote_mkdir|)
				 default: "ssh USEPORT HOSTNAME mkdir"

  *g:netrw_mousemaps*		  =1 (default) enables mouse buttons while
  				   browsing to:
				     leftmouse       : open file/directory
				     shift-leftmouse : mark file
				     middlemouse     : same as P
				     rightmouse      : remove file/directory
				=0: disables mouse maps

  *g:netrw_nobeval*		doesn't exist (default)
				If this variable exists, then balloon
				evaluation will be suppressed
				(see |'ballooneval'|)

  *g:netrw_remote_mkdir*	command for making a remote directory
				via ftp  (also see |g:netrw_mkdir_cmd|)
				 default: "mkdir"

  *g:netrw_retmap*		if it exists and is set to one, then:
				 * if in a netrw-selected file, AND
				 * no normal-mode <2-leftmouse> mapping exists,
				then the <2-leftmouse> will be mapped for easy
				return to the netrw browser window.
				 example: click once to select and open a file,
				          double-click to return.

				Note that one may instead choose to:
				 * let g:netrw_retmap= 1, AND
				 * nmap <silent> YourChoice <Plug>NetrwReturn
				and have another mapping instead of
				<2-leftmouse> to invoke the return.

				You may also use the |:Rexplore| command to do
				the same thing.

				  default: =0

  *g:netrw_rm_cmd*		command for removing remote files
				 default: "ssh USEPORT HOSTNAME rm"

  *g:netrw_rmdir_cmd*		command for removing remote directories
				 default: "ssh USEPORT HOSTNAME rmdir"

  *g:netrw_rmf_cmd*		command for removing remote softlinks
				 default: "ssh USEPORT HOSTNAME rm -f"

  *g:netrw_sort_by*		sort by "name", "time", or "size"
				 default: "name"

  *g:netrw_sort_direction*	sorting direction: "normal" or "reverse"
				 default: "normal"

  *g:netrw_sort_options*	sorting is done using |:sort|; this
				variable's value is appended to the
				sort command.  Thus one may ignore case,
				for example, with the following in your
				.vimrc: >
					let g:netrw_sort_options="i"
<				 default: ""

  *g:netrw_sort_sequence*	when sorting by name, first sort by the
				comma-separated pattern sequence.  Note that
				any filigree added to indicate filetypes
				should be accounted for in your pattern.
				 default: '[\/]$,*,\.bak$,\.o$,\.h$,
				           \.info$,\.swp$,\.obj$'

  *g:netrw_special_syntax*	If true, then certain files will be shown
				using special syntax in the browser:

					netrwBak     : *.bak
					netrwCompress: *.gz *.bz2 *.Z *.zip
					netrwData    : *.dat
					netrwHdr     : *.h
					netrwLib     : *.a *.so *.lib *.dll
					netrwMakefile: [mM]akefile *.mak
					netrwObj     : *.o *.obj
					netrwTags    : tags ANmenu ANtags
					netrwTilde   : *
					netrwTmp     : tmp* *tmp

				These syntax highlighting groups are linked
				to Folded or DiffChange by default
				(see |hl-Folded| and |hl-DiffChange|), but
				one may put lines like >
					hi link netrwCompress Visual
<				into one's <.vimrc> to use one's own
				preferences.  Alternatively, one may
				put such specifications into
				.vim/after/syntax/netrw.vim.

				As an example, I myself use a dark-background
				colorscheme with the following in
				.vim/after/syntax/netrw.vim: >

 hi netrwCompress term=NONE cterm=NONE gui=NONE ctermfg=10 guifg=green  ctermbg=0 guibg=black

 hi netrwSymLink  term=NONE cterm=NONE gui=NONE ctermfg=220 ctermbg=27 guifg=grey60
<
  *g:netrw_ssh_browse_reject*	ssh can sometimes produce unwanted lines,
				messages, banners, and whatnot that one doesn't
				want masquerading as "directories" and "files".
				Use this pattern to remove such embedded
				messages.  By default its value is:
					 '^total\s\+\d\+$'

  *g:netrw_ssh_cmd*		One may specify an executable command
				to use instead of ssh for remote actions
				such as listing, file removal, etc.
				 default: ssh


  *g:netrw_tmpfile_escape*	=' &;'
				escape() is applied to all temporary files
				to escape these characters.

  *g:netrw_timefmt*		specify format string to vim's strftime().
				The default, "%c", is "the preferred date
				and time representation for the current
				locale" according to my manpage entry for
				strftime(); however, not all are satisfied
				with it.  Some alternatives:
				 "%a %d %b %Y %T",
				 " %a %Y-%m-%d  %I-%M-%S %p"
				 default: "%c"

  *g:netrw_use_noswf*		netrw normally avoids writing swapfiles
				for browser buffers.  However, under some
				systems this apparently is causing nasty
				ml_get errors to appear; if you're getting
				ml_get errors, try putting
				  let g:netrw_use_noswf= 0
				in your .vimrc.
				  default: 1

  *g:netrw_winsize*		specify initial size of new windows made with
				"o" (see |netrw-o|), "v" (see |netrw-v|),
				|:Hexplore| or |:Vexplore|.  The g:netrw_winsize
				is an integer describing the percentage of the
				current netrw buffer's window to be used for
				the new window.
				 If g:netrw_winsize is less than zero, then
				the absolute value of g:netrw_winsize lines
				or columns will be used for the new window.
				 If g:netrw_winsize is zero, then a normal
				split will be made (ie. |'equalalways'| will
				take effect, for example).
				 default: 50  (for 50%)

  *g:netrw_xstrlen*		Controls how netrw computes string lengths,
				including multi-byte characters' string
				length. (thanks to N Weibull, T Mechelynck)
				=0: uses Vim's built-in strlen()
				=1: number of codepoints (Latin a + combining
				    circumflex is two codepoints)  (DEFAULT)
				=2: number of spacing codepoints (Latin a +
				    combining circumflex is one spacing
				    codepoint; a hard tab is one; wide and
				    narrow CJK are one each; etc.)
				=3: virtual length (counting tabs as anything
				    between 1 and |'tabstop'|, wide CJK as 2
				    rather than 1, Arabic alif as zero when
				    immediately preceded by lam, one
				    otherwise, etc)

  *g:NetrwTopLvlMenu*		This variable specifies the top level
				menu name; by default, it's "Netrw.".  If
				you wish to change this, do so in your
				.vimrc.

NETRW BROWSING AND OPTION INCOMPATIBILITIES	*netrw-incompatible* {{{2

Netrw has been designed to handle user options by saving them, setting the
options to something that's compatible with netrw's needs, and then restoring
them.  However, the autochdir option: >
	:set acd
is problematic.  Autochdir sets the current directory to that containing the
file you edit; this apparently also applies to directories.  In other words,
autochdir sets the current directory to that containing the "file" (even if
that "file" is itself a directory).

NETRW SETTINGS WINDOW				*netrw-settings-window* {{{2

With the NetrwSettings.vim plugin, >
	:NetrwSettings
will bring up a window with the many variables that netrw uses for its
settings.  You may change any of their values; when you save the file, the
settings therein will be used.  One may also press "?" on any of the lines for
help on what each of the variables do.

(also see: |netrw-browser-var| |netrw-protocol| |netrw-variables|)


==============================================================================
OBTAINING A FILE					*netrw-O* {{{2

If there are no marked files:

    When browsing a remote directory, one may obtain a file under the cursor
    (ie.  get a copy on your local machine, but not edit it) by pressing the O
    key.

If there are marked files:

    The marked files will be obtained (ie. a copy will be transferred to your
    local machine, but not set up for editing).

Only ftp and scp are supported for this operation (but since these two are
available for browsing, that shouldn't be a problem).  The status bar will
then show, on its right hand side, a message like "Obtaining filename".  The
statusline will be restored after the transfer is complete.

Netrw can also "obtain" a file using the local browser.  Netrw's display
of a directory is not necessarily the same as Vim's "current directory",
unless |g:netrw_keepdir| is set to 0 in the user's <.vimrc>.  One may select
a file using the local browser (by putting the cursor on it) and pressing
"O" will then "obtain" the file; ie. copy it to Vim's current directory.

Related topics:
 * To see what the current directory is, use |:pwd|
 * To make the currently browsed directory the current directory, see |netrw-c|
 * To automatically make the currently browsed directory the current
   directory, see |g:netrw_keepdir|.

							*netrw-createfile*
OPEN A NEW FILE IN NETRW'S CURRENT DIRECTORY		*netrw-%*

To open a new file in netrw's current directory, press "%".  This map
will query the user for a new filename; an empty file by that name will
be placed in the netrw's current directory (ie. b:netrw_curdir).

Related topics:               |netrw-d|


PREVIEW WINDOW				*netrw-p* *netrw-preview* {{{2

One may use a preview window by using the "p" key when the cursor is atop the
desired filename to be previewed.  The display will then split to show both
the browser (where the cursor will remain) and the file (see |:pedit|).
By default, the split will be taken horizontally; one may use vertical
splitting if one has set |g:netrw_preview| first.

An interesting set of netrw settings is: >

	let g:netrw_preview   = 1
	let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
	let g:netrw_winsize   = 30

These will:
	1. Make vertical splitting the default for previewing files
	2. Make the default listing style "tree"
	3. When a vertical preview window is opened, the directory listing
	   will use only 30% of the columns available; the rest of the window
	   is used for the preview window.

Also see: |g:netrw_chgwin| |netrw-P|


PREVIOUS WINDOW				*netrw-P* *netrw-prvwin* {{{2

To edit a file or directory in the previously used (last accessed) window (see
:he |CTRL-W_p|), press a "P".  If there's only one window, then the one window
will be horizontally split (by default).

If there's more than one window, the previous window will be re-used on
the selected file/directory.  If the previous window's associated buffer
has been modified, and there's only one window with that buffer, then
the user will be asked if s/he wishes to save the buffer first (yes,
no, or cancel).

Also see: |g:netrw_chgwin| |netrw-p|


REFRESHING THE LISTING			*netrw-ctrl-l* *netrw-ctrl_l* {{{2

To refresh either a local or remote directory listing, press ctrl-l (<c-l>) or
hit the <cr> when atop the ./ directory entry in the listing.  One may also
refresh a local directory by using ":e .".


REVERSING SORTING ORDER		*netrw-r* *netrw-reverse* {{{2

One may toggle between normal and reverse sorting order by pressing the
"r" key.

Related topics:              |netrw-s|
Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_sort_direction|


RENAMING FILES OR DIRECTORIES	*netrw-move* *netrw-rename* *netrw-R* {{{2

If there are no marked files: (see |netrw-mf|)

    Renaming/moving files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
    file/directory to be moved (renamed) and pressing "R".  You will then be
    queried for where you want the file/directory to be moved.  You may select
    a range of lines with the "V" command (visual selection), and then
    pressing "R".

If there are marked files:  (see |netrw-mf|)

    Marked files will be renamed (moved).  You will be queried as above in
    order to specify where you want the file/directory to be moved.

    WARNING:~

    Note that moving files is a dangerous operation; copies are safer.  That's
    because a "move" for remote files is actually a copy + delete -- and if
    the copy fails and the delete does not, you may lose the file.
    Use at your own risk.

The g:netrw_rename_cmd variable is used to implement renaming.  By default its
value is:

	ssh HOSTNAME mv

One may rename a block of files and directories by selecting them with
the V (|linewise-visual|).


SELECTING SORTING STYLE			*netrw-s* *netrw-sort* {{{2

One may select the sorting style by name, time, or (file) size.  The "s" map
allows one to circulate amongst the three choices; the directory listing will
automatically be refreshed to reflect the selected style.

Related topics:               |netrw-r| |netrw-S|
Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_sort_by| |g:netrw_sort_sequence|


SETTING EDITING WINDOW					*netrw-C* {{{2

One may select a netrw window for editing with the "C" mapping, or by setting
g:netrw_chgwin to the selected window number.  Subsequent selection of a file
to edit (|netrw-cr|) will use that window.

	* C  by itself, will select the current window for editing via
	  |netrw-cr|

	* [count]C the count will be used as the window number to be used
	  for editing via |netrw-cr|.
Using >
	let g:netrw_chgwin= -1
will restore the default editing behavior (ie. use the current window).

10. Problems and Fixes					*netrw-problems* {{{1

	(This section is likely to grow as I get feedback)
	(also see |netrw-debug|)
								*netrw-p1*
	P1. I use windows 95, and my ftp dumps four blank lines at the
	    end of every read.

		See |netrw-fixup|, and put the following into your
		<.vimrc> file:

			let g:netrw_win95ftp= 1

								*netrw-p2*
	P2. I use Windows, and my network browsing with ftp doesn't sort by
	    time or size!  -or-  The remote system is a Windows server; why
	    don't I get sorts by time or size?

		Windows' ftp has a minimal support for ls (ie. it doesn't
		accept sorting options).  It doesn't support the -F which
		gives an explanatory character (ABC/ for "ABC is a directory").
		Netrw then uses "dir" to get both its thin and long listings.
		If you think your ftp does support a full-up ls, put the
		following into your <.vimrc>: >

			let g:netrw_ftp_list_cmd    = "ls -lF"
			let g:netrw_ftp_timelist_cmd= "ls -tlF"
			let g:netrw_ftp_sizelist_cmd= "ls -slF"
<
		Alternatively, if you have cygwin on your Windows box, put
		into your <.vimrc>: >

			let g:netrw_cygwin= 1
<
		This problem also occurs when the remote system is Windows.
		In this situation, the various g:netrw_ftp_[time|size]list_cmds
		are as shown above, but the remote system will not correctly
		modify its listing behavior.


								*netrw-p3*
	P3. I tried rcp://user@host/ (or protocol other than ftp) and netrw
	    used ssh!  That wasn't what I asked for...

		Netrw has two methods for browsing remote directories: ssh
		and ftp.  Unless you specify ftp specifically, ssh is used.
		When it comes time to do download a file (not just a directory
		listing), netrw will use the given protocol to do so.

								*netrw-p4*
	P4. I would like long listings to be the default.

		Put the following statement into your |.vimrc|: >

			let g:netrw_liststyle= 1
<
		Check out |netrw-browser-var| for more customizations that
		you can set.

								*netrw-p5*
	P5. My times come up oddly in local browsing

		Does your system's strftime() accept the "%c" to yield dates
		such as "Sun Apr 27 11:49:23 1997"?  If not, do a
		"man strftime" and find out what option should be used.  Then
		put it into your |.vimrc|: >

			let g:netrw_timefmt= "%X"  (where X is the option)
<
								*netrw-p6*
	P6. I want my current directory to track my browsing.
	    How do I do that?

	    Put the following line in your |.vimrc|:
>
		let g:netrw_keepdir= 0
<
								*netrw-p7*
	P7. I use Chinese (or other non-ascii) characters in my filenames, and
	    netrw (Explore, Sexplore, Hexplore, etc) doesn't display them!

		(taken from an answer provided by Wu Yongwei on the vim
		mailing list)
		I now see the problem. Your code page is not 936, right? Vim
		seems only able to open files with names that are valid in the
		current code page, as are many other applications that do not
		use the Unicode version of Windows APIs. This is an OS-related
		issue. You should not have such problems when the system
		locale uses UTF-8, such as modern Linux distros.

		(...it is one more reason to recommend that people use utf-8!)

								*netrw-p8*
	P8. I'm getting "ssh is not executable on your system" -- what do I
	    do?

		(Dudley Fox) Most people I know use putty for windows ssh.  It
		is a free ssh/telnet application. You can read more about it
		here:

		http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Also:

		(Marlin Unruh) This program also works for me. It's a single
		executable, so he/she can copy it into the Windows\System32
		folder and create a shortcut to it.

		(Dudley Fox) You might also wish to consider plink, as it
		sounds most similar to what you are looking for. plink is an
		application in the putty suite.

           http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter7.html#plink

		(Vissale Neang) Maybe you can try OpenSSH for windows, which
		can be obtained from:

		http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/

		It doesn't need the full Cygwin package.

		(Antoine Mechelynck) For individual Unix-like programs needed
		for work in a native-Windows environment, I recommend getting
		them from the GnuWin32 project on sourceforge if it has them:

		    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

		Unlike Cygwin, which sets up a Unix-like virtual machine on
		top of Windows, GnuWin32 is a rewrite of Unix utilities with
		Windows system calls, and its programs works quite well in the
		cmd.exe "Dos box".

		(dave) Download WinSCP and use that to connect to the server.
		In Preferences > Editors, set gvim as your editor:

			- Click "Add..."
			- Set External Editor (adjust path as needed, include
			  the quotes and !.! at the end):
			    "c:\Program Files\Vim\vim70\gvim.exe" !.!
			- Check that the filetype in the box below is
			  {asterisk}.{asterisk} (all files), or whatever types
			  you want (cec: change {asterisk} to * ; I had to
			  write it that way because otherwise the helptags
			  system thinks it's a tag)
			- Make sure it's at the top of the listbox (click it,
			  then click "Up" if it's not)
		If using the Norton Commander style, you just have to hit <F4>
		to edit a file in a local copy of gvim.

		(Ben Schmidt) I find the ssh included with cwRsync is
		brilliant, and install cwRsync or cwRsyncServer on most
		Windows systems I come across these days. I guess COPSSH,
		packed by the same person, is probably even better for use as
		just ssh on Windows, and probably includes sftp, etc. which I
		suspect the cwRsync doesn't, though it might

		(cec) To make proper use of these suggestions above, you will
		need to modify the following user-settable variables in your
		.vimrc:

		|g:netrw_ssh_cmd| |g:netrw_list_cmd|  |g:netrw_mkdir_cmd|
		|g:netrw_rm_cmd|  |g:netrw_rmdir_cmd| |g:netrw_rmf_cmd|

		The first one (|g:netrw_ssh_cmd|) is the most important; most
		of the others will use the string in g:netrw_ssh_cmd by
		default.
						*netrw-p9* *netrw-ml_get*
	P9. I'm browsing, changing directory, and bang!  ml_get errors
	    appear and I have to kill vim.  Any way around this?

		Normally netrw attempts to avoid writing swapfiles for
		its temporary directory buffers.  However, on some systems
		this attempt appears to be causing ml_get errors to
		appear.  Please try setting |g:netrw_use_noswf| to 0
		in your <.vimrc>: >
			let g:netrw_use_noswf= 0
<
								*netrw-p10*
	P10. I'm being pestered with "[something] is a directory" and
	     "Press ENTER or type command to continue" prompts...

		The "[something] is a directory" prompt is issued by Vim,
		not by netrw, and there appears to be no way to work around
		it.  Coupled with the default cmdheight of 1, this message
		causes the "Press ENTER..." prompt.  So:  read |hit-enter|;
		I also suggest that you set your |'cmdheight'| to 2 (or more) in
		your <.vimrc> file.

								*netrw-p11*
	P11. I want to have two windows; a thin one on the left and my editing
	     window on the right.  How may I accomplish this?

		* Put the following line in your <.vimrc>:
			let g:netrw_altv = 1
		* Edit the current directory:  :e .
		* Select some file, press v
		* Resize the windows as you wish (see |CTRL-W_<| and
		  |CTRL-W_>|).  If you're using gvim, you can drag
		  the separating bar with your mouse.
		* When you want a new file, use  ctrl-w h  to go back to the
		  netrw browser, select a file, then press P  (see |CTRL-W_h|
		  and |netrw-P|).  If you're using gvim, you can press
		  <leftmouse> in the browser window and then press the
		  <middlemouse> to select the file.

								*netrw-p12*
	P12. My directory isn't sorting correctly, or unwanted letters are
	     appearing in the listed filenames, or things aren't lining
	     up properly in the wide listing, ...

	     This may be due to an encoding problem.  I myself usually use
	     utf-8, but really only use ascii (ie. bytes from 32-126).
	     Multibyte encodings use two (or more) bytes per character.
	     You may need to change |g:netrw_sepchr| and/or |g:netrw_xstrlen|.

								*netrw-p13*
	P13. I'm a Windows + putty + ssh user, and when I attempt to browse,
	     the directories are missing trailing "/"s so netrw treats them
	     as file transfers instead of as attempts to browse
	     subdirectories.  How may I fix this?

	     (mikeyao) If you want to use vim via ssh and putty under Windows,
	     try combining the use of pscp/psftp with plink.  pscp/psftp will
	     be used to connect and plink will be used to execute commands on
	     the server, for example: list files and directory using 'ls'.

	     These are the settings I use to do this:
>
	    " list files, it's the key setting, if you haven't set,
	    " you will get a blank buffer
	    let g:netrw_list_cmd = "plink HOSTNAME ls -Fa"
	    " if you haven't add putty directory in system path, you should
	    " specify scp/sftp command.  For examples:
	    "let g:netrw_sftp_cmd = "d:\\dev\\putty\\PSFTP.exe"
	    "let g:netrw_scp_cmd = "d:\\dev\\putty\\PSCP.exe"
<
								*netrw-p14*
	P14. I'd would like to speed up writes using Nwrite and scp/ssh
	     style connections.  How?  (Thomer M. Gil)

	     Try using ssh's ControlMaster and ControlPath (see the ssh_config
	     man page) to share multiple ssh connections over a single network
	     connection. That cuts out the cryptographic handshake on each
	     file write, sometimes speeding it up by an order of magnitude.
	     (see  http://thomer.com/howtos/netrw_ssh.html)
	     (included by permission)

	     Add the following to your ~/.ssh/config: >

		 # you change "*" to the hostname you care about
		 Host *
		   ControlMaster auto
		   ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p

<	     Then create an ssh connection to the host and leave it running: >

		 ssh -N host.domain.com

<	     Now remotely open a file with Vim's Netrw and enjoy the
	     zippiness: >

		vim scp://host.domain.com//home/user/.bashrc
<
								*netrw-p15*
	P15. How may I use a double-click instead of netrw's usual single click
	     to open a file or directory?  (Ben Fritz)

	     First, disable netrw's mapping with >
		    let g:netrw_mousemaps= 0
<	     and then create a netrw buffer only mapping in
	     $HOME/.vim/after/ftplugin/netrw.vim: >
		    nmap <buffer> <2-leftmouse> <CR>
<	     Note that setting g:netrw_mousemaps to zero will turn off
	     all netrw's mouse mappings, not just the <leftmouse> one.
	     (see |g:netrw_mousemaps|)

								*netrw-p16*
	P16. When editing remote files (ex. :e ftp://hostname/path/file),
	     under Windows I get an |E303| message complaining that its unable
	     to open a swap file.

	     (romainl) It looks like you are starting Vim from a protected
	     directory.  Start if from your $HOME or another writable
	     directory.

11. Debugging Netrw Itself				*netrw-debug* {{{1

The <netrw.vim> script is typically available as something like:
>
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim7x/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim7x/autoload/netrw.vim
<
which is loaded automatically at startup (assuming :set nocp).

	1. Get the <Decho.vim> script, available as:

	     http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#DECHO
	   or
	     http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=120

	  Decho.vim is provided as a "vimball"; see |vimball-intro|.

	2. Edit the <netrw.vim> file by typing: >

		vim netrw.vim
		:DechoOn
		:wq
<
	   To restore to normal non-debugging behavior, re-edit <netrw.vim>
	   and type >

		vim netrw.vim
		:DechoOff
		:wq
<
	   This command, provided by <Decho.vim>, will comment out all
	   Decho-debugging statements (Dfunc(), Dret(), Decho(), Dredir()).

	3. Then bring up vim and attempt to evoke the problem by doing a
	   transfer or doing some browsing.  A set of messages should appear
	   concerning the steps that <netrw.vim> took in attempting to
	   read/write your file over the network in a separate tab.

				  the browser with ftp on a directory,
				  and selecting a gzipped txt file, that
				  an E19 occurred (which was issued by
				  gzip.vim).  Fixed.
		Mar 14, 2014	* Implemented :MF and :MT (see |netrw-:MF|
				  and |netrw-:MT|, respectively)
		Mar 17, 2014	* |:Ntree| [dir] wasn't working properly; fixed
		Mar 18, 2014	* Changed all uses of set to setl
		Mar 18, 2014	* Commented the netrw_btkeep line in
				  s:NetrwOptionSave(); the effect is that
				  netrw buffers will remain as |'bt'|=nofile.
				  This should prevent swapfiles being created
				  for netrw buffers.
		Mar 20, 2014	* Changed all uses of lcd to use s:NetrwLcd()
				  instead.  Consistent error handling results
				  and it also handles Window's shares
				* Fixed |netrw-d| command when applied with ftp
				* https: support included for netrw#NetRead()
	v150:	Jul 12, 2013	* removed a "keepalt" to allow ":e #" to
				  return to the netrw directory listing
		Jul 13, 2013	* (Jonas Diemer) suggested changing
				  a <cWORD> to <cfile>.
		Jul 21, 2013	* (Yuri Kanivetsky) reported that netrw's
				  use of mkdir did not produce directories
				  following the user's umask.
		Aug 27, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_altfile| option
		Sep 05, 2013	* s:Strlen() now uses |strdisplaywidth()|
				  when available, by default
		Sep 12, 2013	* (Selyano Baldo) reported that netrw wasn't
				  opening some directories properly from the
				  command line.
		Nov 09, 2013	* |:Lexplore| introduced
				* (Ondrej Platek) reported an issue with
				  netrw's trees (P15).  Fixed.
				* (Jorge Solis) reported that "t" in
				  tree mode caused netrw to forget its
				  line position.
		Dec 05, 2013	* Added <s-leftmouse> file marking
				  (see |netrw-mf|)
		Dec 05, 2013	* (Yasuhiro Matsumoto) Explore should use
				  strlen() instead s:Strlen() when handling
				  multibyte chars with strpart()
				  (ie. strpart() is byte oriented, not
				  display-width oriented).
		Dec 09, 2013	* (Ken Takata) Provided a patch; File sizes
				  and a portion of timestamps were wrongly
				  highlighted with the directory color when
				  setting `:let g:netrw_liststyle=1` on Windows.
				* (Paul Domaskis) noted that sometimes
				  cursorline was activating in non-netrw
				  windows.  All but one setting of cursorline
				  was done via setl; there was one that was
				  overlooked.  Fixed.
		Dec 24, 2013	* (esquifit) asked that netrw allow the
				  /cygdrive prefix be a user-alterable
				  parameter.
		Jan 02, 2014	* Fixed a problem with netrw-based ballon
				  evaluation (ie. netrw#NetrwBaloonHelp()
				  not having been loaded error messages)
		Jan 03, 2014	* Fixed a problem with tree listings
				* New command installed: |:Ntree|
		Jan 06, 2014	* (Ivan Brennan) reported a problem with
				  |netrw-P|.  Fixed.
		Jan 06, 2014	* Fixed a problem with |netrw-P| when the
				  modified file was to be abandoned.
		Jan 15, 2014	* (Matteo Cavalleri) reported that when the
				  banner is suppressed and tree listing is
				  used, a blank line was left at the top of
				  the display.  Fixed.
		Jan 20, 2014	* (Gideon Go) reported that, in tree listing
				  style, with a previous window open, that
				  the wrong directory was being used to open
				  a file.  Fixed. (P21)
	v149:	Apr 18, 2013	* in wide listing format, now have maps for
				  w and b to move to next/previous file
		Apr 26, 2013	* one may now copy files in the same
				  directory; netrw will issue requests for
				  what names the files should be copied under
		Apr 29, 2013	* Trying Benzinger's problem again.  Seems
				  that commenting out the BufEnter and
				  installing VimEnter (only) works.  Weird
				  problem!  (tree listing, vim -O Dir1 Dir2)
		May 01, 2013	* :Explore ftp://... wasn't working.  Fixed.
		May 02, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_bannerbackslash| as
				  requested by Paul Domaskis.
		Jul 03, 2013	* Explore now avoids splitting when a buffer
				  will be hidden.
	v148:	Apr 16, 2013	* changed Netrw's Style menu to allow direct
				  choice of listing style, hiding style, and
				  sorting style
	v147:	Nov 24, 2012	* (James McCoy) Even with g:netrw_dirhistmax
				  at zero, the .vim/ directory would be
				  created to support history/bookmarks.  I've
				  gone over netrw to suppress history and
				  bookmarking when g:netrw_dirhistmax is zero.
				  For instance, the menus will display
				  (disabled) when attempts to use
				  bookmarks/history are made.
		Nov 29, 2012	* (Kim Jang-hwan) reported that with
				  g:Align_xstrlen set to 3 that the cursor was
				  moved (linewise) after invocation.  This
				  problem also afflicted netrw.
				  (see |g:netrw_xstrlen|) Fixed.
		Jan 21, 2013	* (mattn) provided a patch to insert some
				  endifs needed with the code implementing
				  |netrw-O|.
		Jan 24, 2013	* (John Szakmeister) found that remote file
				  editing resulted in filetype options being
				  overwritten by NetrwOptionRestore().  I
				  moved filetype detect from NetrwGetFile()
				  to NetrwOptionRestore.
		Feb 17, 2013	* (Yukhiro Nakadaira) provided a patch
				  correcting some syntax errors.
		Feb 28, 2013	* (Ingo Karkat) provided a patch preventing
				  receipt of an |E95| when revisiting a
				  file://... style url.
		Mar 18, 2013	* (Gary Johnson) pointed out that changing
				  cedit to <Esc> caused problems with visincr;
				  the cedit setting is now bypassed in netrw too.
		Apr 02, 2013	* (Paul Domaskis) reported an undefined
				  variable error (s:didstarstar) was
				  occurring.  It is now defined at
				  initialization.
				* included additional sanity checking for the
				  marked file functions.
				* included |netrw-qF| and special "j" option
				  handling for |netrw-mg|
		Apr 12, 2013	* |netrw-u| and |netrw-U| now handle counts
				* the former mapping for "T" has been removed;
				  in its place are new maps, |netrw-Tb| and |netrw-Th|.
				* the menu now supports a "Targets" entry for
				  easier target selection. (see |netrw-mt|)
				* (Paul Domaskis) reported some problems with
				  moving/copying files under Windows' gvim
				  (ie. not cygwin).  Fixed.
				* (Paul Mueller) provided a patch to get
				  start and rundll working via |netrw-gx|
				  by bypassing the user's |'shellslash'| option.
	v146:	Oct 20, 2012	* (David Kotchan) reported that under Windows,
				  directories named with unusual characters
				  such as "#" or "$" were not being listed
				  properly.
				* (Kenny Lee) reported that the buffer list
				  was being populated by netrw buffers.
				  Netrw will now |:bwipe| netrw buffers
				  upon editing a file if g:netrw_fastbrowse
				  is zero and its not in tree listing style.
				* fixed a bug with s:NetrwInit() that
				  prevented initialization with |Lists| and
				  |Dictionaries|.
				* |netrw-mu| now unmarks marked-file lists
	v145:	Apr 05, 2012	* moved some command from a g:netrw_local_...
				  format to g:netwr_local... format
				* included some NOTE level messages about
				  commands that aren't executable
				* |g:netrw_errorlvl| (default: NOTE=0)
				  option introduced
		May 18, 2012	* (Ilya Dogolazky) a scenario where a
				  |g:netrw_fastbrowse| of zero did not
				  have a local directory refreshed fixed.
		Jul 10, 2012	* (Donatas) |netrw-gb| wasn't working due
				  to an incorrectly used variable.
		Aug 09, 2012	* (Bart Baker) netrw was doubling
				  of entries after a split.
				* (code by Takahiro Yoshihara) implemented
				  |g:netrw_dynamic_maxfilenamelen|
		Aug 31, 2012	* (Andrew Wong) netrw refresh overwriting
				  the yank buffer.
	v144: Mar 12, 2012	* when |CTRL-W_s| or |CTRL-W_v| are used,
				  or their wincmd equivalents, on a netrw
				  buffer, the netrw's w: variables were
				  not copied over.  Fixed.
		Mar 13, 2012	* nbcd_curpos_{bufnr('%')} was commented
				  out, and was mistakenly used during
				  RestorePosn.  Unfortunately, I'm not
				  sure why it was commented out, so this
				  "fix" may re-introduce an earlier problem.
		Mar 21, 2012	* included s:rexposn internally to make
				  :Rex return the cursor to the same pos'n
				  upon restoration of netrw buffer
		Mar 27, 2012	* (sjbesse) s:NetrwGetFile() needs to remove
				  "/" from the netrw buffer's usual |'isk'|
				  in order to allow "filetype detect" to work
				  properly for scripts.
	v143: Jun 01, 2011	* |g:netrw_winsize| will accept a negative
				  number; the absolute value of it will then
				  be used to specify lines/columns instead of
				  a percentage.
		Jul 05, 2011	* the "d" map now supports mkdir via ftp
				  See |netrw-d| and |g:netrw_remote_mkdir|
		Jul 11, 2011	* Changed Explore!, Sexplore!, and Vexplore
				  to use a percentage of |winwidth()| instead
				  of a percentage of |winheight()|.
		Jul 11, 2011	* included support for https://... I'm just
				  beginning to test this, however.
		Aug 01, 2011	* changed RestoreOptions to also restore
				  cursor position in netrw buffers.
		Aug 12, 2011	* added a note about "%" to the balloon
		Aug 30, 2011	* if |g:netrw_nobeval| exists, then balloon
				  evaluation is suppressed.
		Aug 31, 2011	* (Benjamin R Haskell) provided a patch that
				  implements non-standard port handling for
				  files opened via the remote browser.
		Aug 31, 2011	* Fixed a **//pattern  Explorer bug
		Sep 15, 2011	* (reported by Francesco Campana) netrw
				  now permits the "@" to be part of the
				  user id (if there's an @ that appears
				  to the right).
		Nov 21, 2011	* New option: |g:netrw_ftp_options|
		Dec 07, 2011	* (James Sinclair) provided a fix handling
				  attempts to use a uid and password when
				  they weren't defined.  This affected
				  NetWrite (NetRead already had that fix).

Highlighting matching parens			*matchparen*

The functionality mentioned here is a |standard-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_matchparen" variable: >
	:let loaded_matchparen = 1

The plugin installs CursorMoved, CursorMovedI and WinEnter autocommands to
redefine the match highlighting.

					*:NoMatchParen* *:DoMatchParen*
To disable the plugin after it was loaded use this command: >

	:NoMatchParen

And to enable it again: >

	:DoMatchParen

The highlighting used is MatchParen.  You can specify different colors with
the ":highlight" command.  Example: >

	:hi MatchParen ctermbg=blue guibg=lightblue

The characters to be matched come from the 'matchpairs' option.  You can
change the value to highlight different matches.  Note that not everything is
possible.  For example, you can't highlight single or double quotes, because
the start and end are equal.

The syntax highlighting attributes are used.  When the cursor currently is not
in a string or comment syntax item, then matches inside string and comment
syntax items are ignored.  Any syntax items with "string" or "comment"
somewhere in their name are considered string or comment items.

The search is limited to avoid a delay when moving the cursor.  The limits
are:
- What is visible in the window.
- 100 lines above or below the cursor to avoid a long delay when there are
  closed folds.
- 'synmaxcol' times 2 bytes before or after the cursor to avoid a delay
  in a long line with syntax highlighting.
- A timeout of 300 msec (60 msec in Insert mode). This can be changed with the
  g:matchparen_timeout and g:matchparen_insert_timeout variables and their
  buffer-local equivalents b:matchparen_timeout and
  b:matchparen_insert_timeout.

If you would like the |%| command to work better, the matchit plugin can be
used, see |matchit-install|.  This plugin also helps to skip matches in
comments.  This is unrelated to the matchparen highlighting, they use a
different mechanism.

Last change: 2006 Apr 24

by Gustavo Niemeyer ~

This is a filetype plugin to work with rpm spec files.

Currently, this Vim plugin allows you to easily update the %changelog
section in RPM spec files.  It will even create a section for you if it
doesn't exist yet.  If you've already inserted an entry today, it will
give you the opportunity to just add a new item in today's entry.  If you
don't provide a format string (|spec_chglog_format|), it'll ask you an
email address and build a format string by itself.

1. How to use it	|spec-how-to-use-it|
2. Customizing		|spec-customizing|

==============================================================================
1. How to use it				*spec-how-to-use-it*

The spec_chglog plugin provides a map like the following:

	:map <buffer> <LocalLeader>c <Plug>SpecChangelog

It means that you may run the plugin inside a spec file by pressing
your maplocalleader key (default is '\') plus 'c'.  If you do not have
|spec_chglog_format| set, the plugin will ask you for an email address
to use in this edit session.

Every time you run the plugin, it will check to see if the last entry in the
changelog has been written today and by you.  If the entry matches, it will
just insert a new changelog item, otherwise it will create a new changelog
entry.  If you are running with |spec_chglog_release_info| enabled, it will
also check if the name, version and release matches.  The plugin is smart
enough to ask you if it should update the package release, if you have not
done so.

Setting a map					*spec-setting-a-map*
-------------

As you should know, you can easily set a map to access any Vim command (or
anything, for that matter).  If you don't like the default map of
<LocalLeader>c, you may just set up your own key.  The following line
shows you how you could do this in your .vimrc file, mapping the plugin to
the <F5> key:

	au FileType spec map <buffer> <F5> <Plug>SpecChangelog

Note: the plugin will respect your desire to change the default mapping
      and won't set it.

This command will add a map only in the spec file buffers.


==============================================================================
2. Customizing					*spec-customizing*

The format string				*spec_chglog_format*
-----------------

You can easily customize how your spec file entry will look like.  To do
this just set the variable "spec_chglog_format" in your .vimrc file like
this: >

	let spec_chglog_format = "%a %b %d %Y My Name <my@email.com>"

Note that "%a %b %d %Y" is the most used time format.  If you don't provide
a format string, when you run the SpecChangelog command for the first
time, it will ask you an email address and build the |spec_chglog_format|
variable for you.  This way, you will only need to provide your email
address once.

To discover which format options you can use, take a look at the strftime()
function man page.

Where to insert new items			*spec_chglog_prepend*
-------------------------

The plugin will usually insert new %changelog entry items (note that it's
not the entry itself) after the existing ones.  If you set the
spec_chglog_prepend variable >

	let spec_chglog_prepend = 1

it will insert new items before the existing ones.

Inserting release info				*spec_chglog_release_info*
----------------------

If you want, the plugin may automatically insert release information
on each changelog entry.  One advantage of turning this feature on is
that it may control if the release has been updated after the last
change in the package or not.  If you have not updated the package
version or release, it will ask you if it should update the package
release for you.  To turn this feature on, just insert the following
code in your .vimrc: >

	let spec_chglog_release_info = 1

Then, the first item in your changelog entry will be something like: >

	+ name-1.0-1cl

If you don't like the release updating feature and don't want to answer
"No" each time it detects an old release, you may disable it with >

	let spec_chglog_never_increase_release = 1

   4. History...................................................|tar-history|

==============================================================================
2. Usage					*tar-usage* *tar-manual*

   When one edits a *.tar file, this plugin will handle displaying a
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   tar archives via the plugin.

						*:Vimuntar*
   VIMUNTAR~

   :Vimuntar [vimhome]

	This command copies, if necessary, the tarball to the .vim or vimfiles
	directory using the first writable directory in the |'runtimepath'|
	when no [vimhome] is specified.  Otherwise, the [vimhome] argument
	allows the user to specify that directory, instead.

	The copy is done using the command in *g:tar_copycmd* , which is >
		cp   for cygwin, unix, macunix
		copy for windows (32, 95, 64, 16)
<	The extraction is done with the command specified with
	*g:tar_extractcmd* , which by default is >
		"tar -xf"
<
						*:TarDiff*
   DIFFERENCING SUPPORT~

   :TarDiff [filename]

	This command will attempt to show the differences between the tarball
	version of a file and the associated file on the system.  In order to
	find that file on the system, the script uses the path associated with
	the file mentioned in the tarball.  If the current directory is not
	correct for that path, :TarDiff will fail to find the associated file.

	If the [filename] is given, that that filename (and path) will be used
	to specify the associated file.


   PREVENTING LOADING~

   If for some reason you do not wish to use vim to examine tar'd files,
   you may put the following two variables into your <.vimrc> to prevent
   the tar plugin from loading: >

	let g:loaded_tarPlugin= 1
	let g:loaded_tar      = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Options						*tar-options*

   These options are variables that one may change, typically in one's
   <.vimrc> file.
                         Default
   Variable               Value   Explanation
   *g:tar_browseoptions*  "Ptf"   used to get a list of contents
   *g:tar_readoptions*    "OPxf"  used to extract a file from a tarball
   *g:tar_cmd*            "tar"   the name of the tar program
   *g:tar_nomax*            0     if true, file window will not be maximized
   *g:tar_secure*         undef   if exists:
					"--"s will be used to prevent unwanted
					option expansion in tar commands.
					Please be sure that your tar command
					accepts "--"; Posix compliant tar
					utilities do accept them.
				  if not exists:
				  	The tar plugin will reject any tar
					files or member files that begin with
					"-"
				  Not all tar's support the "--" which is why
				  it isn't default.
   *g:tar_writeoptions*   "uf"    used to update/replace a file


==============================================================================

==============================================================================
2. Vimball Introduction						*vimball-intro*

	Vimball is intended to make life simpler for users of plugins.  All
	a user needs to do with a vimball is: >
		vim someplugin.vba
		:so %
		:q
<	and the plugin and all its components will be installed into their
	appropriate directories.  Note that one doesn't need to be in any
	particular directory when one does this.  Plus, any help for the
	plugin will also be automatically installed.

	If a user has decided to use the AsNeeded plugin, vimball is smart
	enough to put scripts nominally intended for .vim/plugin/ into
	.vim/AsNeeded/ instead.

	Removing a plugin that was installed with vimball is really easy: >
		vim
		:RmVimball someplugin
<	This operation is not at all easy for zips and tarballs, for example.

	Vimball examines the user's |'runtimepath'| to determine where to put
	the scripts.  The first directory mentioned on the runtimepath is
	usually used if possible.  Use >
		:echo &rtp
<	to see that directory.


==============================================================================
3. Vimball Manual					*vimball-manual*

MAKING A VIMBALL						*:MkVimball*
		:[range]MkVimball[!] filename [path]

	The range is composed of lines holding paths to files to be included
	in your new vimball, omitting the portion of the paths that is
	normally specified by the runtimepath (|'rtp'|).  As an example: >
		plugin/something.vim
		doc/something.txt
<	using >
		:[range]MkVimball filename
<
	on this range of lines will create a file called "filename.vba" which
	can be used by Vimball.vim to re-create these files.  If the
	"filename.vba" file already exists, then MkVimball will issue a
	warning and not create the file.  Note that these paths are relative
	to your .vim (vimfiles) directory, and the files should be in that
	directory.  The vimball plugin normally uses the first |'runtimepath'|
	directory that exists as a prefix; don't use absolute paths, unless
	the user has specified such a path.

	If you use the exclamation point (!), then MkVimball will create the
	"filename.vba" file, overwriting it if it already exists.  This
	behavior resembles that for |:w|.

	If you wish to force slashes into the filename, that can also be done
	by using the exclamation mark (ie. :MkVimball! path/filename).

	The tip at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_VimBall_with_%27Make%27
	has a good idea on how to automate the production of vimballs using
	make.


MAKING DIRECTORIES VIA VIMBALLS				*g:vimball_mkdir*

	First, the |mkdir()| command is tried (not all systems support it).

	If it doesn't exist, then if g:vimball_mkdir doesn't exist, it is set
	as follows: >
	  |g:netrw_local_mkdir|, if it exists
	  "mkdir"              , if it is executable
	  "makedir"            , if it is executable
	  Otherwise            , it is undefined.
<	One may explicitly specify the directory making command using
	g:vimball_mkdir.  This command is used to make directories that
	are needed as indicated by the vimball.


CONTROLLING THE VIMBALL EXTRACTION DIRECTORY		*g:vimball_home*

	You may override the use of the |'runtimepath'| by specifying a
	variable, g:vimball_home.

							*vimball-extract*
		vim filename.vba

	Simply editing a Vimball will cause Vimball.vim to tell the user to
	source the file to extract its contents.

	Extraction will only proceed if the first line of a putative vimball
	file holds the "Vimball Archiver by Charles E. Campbell, Jr., Ph.D."
	line.

LISTING FILES IN A VIMBALL					*:VimballList*

		:VimballList

	This command will tell Vimball to list the files in the archive, along
	with their lengths in lines.

MANUALLY INVOKING VIMBALL EXTRACTION				*:UseVimball*

		:UseVimball [path]

	This command is contained within the vimball itself; it invokes the
	vimball#Vimball() routine which is responsible for unpacking the
	vimball.  One may choose to execute it by hand instead of sourcing
	the vimball; one may also choose to specify a path for the
	installation, thereby overriding the automatic choice of the first
	existing directory on the |'runtimepath'|.

REMOVING A VIMBALL						*:RmVimball*

		:RmVimball vimballfile [path]

	This command removes all files generated by the specified vimball
	(but not any directories it may have made).  One may choose a path
	for de-installation, too (see |'runtimepath'|); otherwise, the
	default is the first existing directory on the |'runtimepath'|.
	To implement this, a file (.VimballRecord) is made in that directory
	containing a record of what files need to be removed for all vimballs
	used thus far.

PREVENTING LOADING

	If for some reason you don't want to be able to extract plugins
	using vimballs: you may prevent the loading of vimball.vim by
	putting the following two variables in your <.vimrc>: >

		let g:loaded_vimballPlugin= 1
		let g:loaded_vimball      = 1
<
WINDOWS							*vimball-windows*

	Many vimball files are compressed with gzip.  Windows, unfortunately,
	does not come provided with a tool to decompress gzip'ped files.
	Fortunately, there are a number of tools available for Windows users
	to un-gzip files:

	34 : Sep 22, 2011 * "UseVimball path" now supports a non-full path by
			    prepending the current directory to it.
	33 : Apr 02, 2011 * Gave priority to *.vmb over *.vba

			    extension to vmb.  Currently both are supported;
			    MkVimball, however, now will create *.vmb files.
	     Feb 11, 2011 * motoyakurotsu reported an error with vimball's
			    handling of zero-length files
	30 : Dec 08, 2008 * fnameescape() inserted to protect error
			    messaging using corrupted filenames from
			    causing problems
			  * RmVimball supports filenames that would
			    otherwise be considered to have "magic"
			    characters (ie. Abc[1].vba)
	     Feb 18, 2009 * s:Escape(), g:vimball_shq, and g:netrw_shq
			    removed (shellescape() used directly)

			    necessary.
	     May 30, 2008 * (tnx to Bill McCarthy) found and fixed a bug:
			    vimball wasn't updating plugins to AsNeeded/
			    when it should
	25 : Mar 24, 2008 * changed vimball#Vimball() to recognize doc/*.??x
			    files as help files, too.
	     Apr 18, 2008 * RmVimball command is now protected by saving and
	                    restoring settings -- in particular, acd was
			    causing problems as reported by Zhang Shuhan
	24 : Nov 15, 2007 * g:vimball_path_escape used by s:Path() to
	                    prevent certain characters from causing trouble

			    now used instead)
	22 : Mar 21, 2007 * uses setlocal instead of set during BufEnter
	21 : Nov 27, 2006 * (tnx to Bill McCarthy) vimball had a header
	                    handling problem and it now changes \s to /s
	20 : Nov 20, 2006 * substitute() calls have all had the 'e' flag
	                    removed.
	18 : Aug 01, 2006 * vimballs now use folding to easily display their
	                    contents.
			  * if a user has AsNeeded/somefile, then vimball
			    will extract plugin/somefile to the AsNeeded/
			    directory
	17 : Jun 28, 2006 * changes all \s to /s internally for Windows
	16 : Jun 15, 2006 * A. Mechelynck's idea to allow users to specify
			    installation root paths implemented for
			    UseVimball, MkVimball, and RmVimball.
			  * RmVimball implemented
	15 : Jun 13, 2006 * bugfix
	14 : May 26, 2006 * bugfixes

			    the vimball specified were needed.  Fixed.
	10 : Apr 27, 2006 * moved all setting saving/restoration to a pair of
			    functions.  Included some more settings in them
			    which frequently cause trouble.
	9  : Apr 26, 2006 * various changes to support Windows' predilection

   1. Contents................................................|zip-contents|
   2. Usage...................................................|zip-usage|
   3. Additional Extensions...................................|zip-extension|
   4. History.................................................|zip-history|

==============================================================================
2. Usage						*zip-usage* *zip-manual*

   When one edits a *.zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   zip archives via the plugin.

   OPTIONS

   							*g:zip_nomax*

   If this variable exists and is true, the file window will not be
   automatically maximized when opened.

							*g:zip_shq*
   Different operating systems may use one or more shells to execute
   commands.  Zip will try to guess the correct quoting mechanism to
   allow spaces and whatnot in filenames; however, if it is incorrectly
   guessing the quote to use for your setup, you may use >
	g:zip_shq
<  which by default is a single quote under Unix (') and a double quote
   under Windows (").  If you'd rather have no quotes, simply set
   g:zip_shq to the empty string (let g:zip_shq= "") in your <.vimrc>.

   							*g:zip_unzipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "unzip".
   It's used during browsing. By default: >
   	let g:zip_unzipcmd= "unzip"
<
							*g:zip_zipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "zip".
   It's used during the writing (updating) of a file already in a zip
   file; by default: >
   	let g:zip_zipcmd= "zip"
<
   PREVENTING LOADING~

   If for some reason you do not wish to use vim to examine zipped files,
   you may put the following two variables into your <.vimrc> to prevent
   the zip plugin from loading: >

	let g:loaded_zipPlugin= 1
	let g:loaded_zip      = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Additional Extensions					*zip-extension*

   Apparently there are a number of archivers which generate zip files that
   don't use the .zip extension (.jar, .xpi, etc).  To handle such files,
   place a line in your <.vimrc> file: >

	au BufReadCmd *.jar,*.xpi call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))
<
   One can simply extend this line to accommodate additional extensions that
   should be treated as zip files.

==============================================================================
4. History							*zip-history* {{{1
   v26 Nov 15, 2012 * (Jason Spiro) provided a lot of new extensions that
		      are synonyms for .zip
   v25 Jun 27, 2011 * using keepj with unzip -Z

   v17 May 09, 2008 * arno caught a security bug
   v15 Sep 07, 2007 * &shq now used if not the empty string for g:zip_shq
   v14 May 07, 2007 * using b:zipfile instead of w:zipfile to avoid problem
                      when editing alternate file to bring up a zipfile
   v10 May 02, 2006 * now using "redraw then echo" to show messages, instead
                      of "echo and prompt user"
		    * g:zip_shq provided to allow for quoting control for the
		      command being passed via :r! ... commands.
   v8 Apr 10, 2006 * Bram Moolenaar reported that he received an error message
                     due to "Pattern not found: ^.*\%0c"; this was caused by
		     stridx finding a Name... at the beginning of the line;
		     zip.vim tried 4,$s/^.*\%0c//, but that doesn't work.
		     Fixed.
   v7 Mar 22, 2006 * escaped some characters that can cause filename handling
                     problems.
   v6 Dec 21, 2005 * writing to files not in directories caused problems -
                     fixed (pointed out by Christian Robinson)

{Vi has None of this}
{only available when compiled with the |+printer| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*print-intro*

On MS-Windows Vim can print your text on any installed printer.  On other
systems a PostScript file is produced.  This can be directly sent to a
PostScript printer.  For other printers a program like ghostscript needs to be
used.

Note: If you have problems printing with |:hardcopy|, an alternative is to use
|:TOhtml| and print the resulting html file from a browser.

					*:ha* *:hardcopy* *E237* *E238* *E324*
:[range]ha[rdcopy][!] [arguments]
			Send [range] lines (default whole file) to the
			printer.

			On MS-Windows a dialog is displayed to allow selection
			of printer, paper size etc.  To skip the dialog, use
			the [!].  In this case the printer defined by
			'printdevice' is used, or, if 'printdevice' is empty,
			the system default printer.

			For systems other than MS-Windows, PostScript is
			written in a temp file and 'printexpr' is used to
			actually print it.  Then [arguments] can be used by
			'printexpr' through |v:cmdarg|.  Otherwise [arguments]
			is ignored.  'printoptions' can be used to specify
			paper size, duplex, etc.

:[range]ha[rdcopy][!] >{filename}
			As above, but write the resulting PostScript in file
			{filename}.
			Things like "%" are expanded |cmdline-special|
			Careful: An existing file is silently overwritten.
			{only available when compiled with the |+postscript|
			feature}
			On MS-Windows use the "print to file" feature of the
			printer driver.

Progress is displayed during printing as a page number and a percentage.  To
abort printing use the interrupt key (CTRL-C or, on MS-systems, CTRL-Break).

Printer output is controlled by the 'printfont' and 'printoptions' options.
'printheader' specifies the format of a page header.

The printed file is always limited to the selected margins, irrespective of
the current window's 'wrap' or 'linebreak' settings.  The "wrap" item in
'printoptions' can be used to switch wrapping off.
The current highlighting colors are used in the printout, with the following
considerations:
1) The normal background is always rendered as white (i.e. blank paper).
2) White text or the default foreground is rendered as black, so that it shows
   up!
3) If 'background' is "dark", then the colours are darkened to compensate for
   the fact that otherwise they would be too bright to show up clearly on
   white paper.

==============================================================================
2. Print options					*print-options*

Here are the details for the options that change the way printing is done.
For generic info about setting options see |options.txt|.

							*pdev-option*
'printdevice' 'pdev'	string	(default empty)
			global
This defines the name of the printer to be used when the |:hardcopy| command
is issued with a bang (!) to skip the printer selection dialog.  On Win32, it
should be the printer name exactly as it appears in the standard printer
dialog.
If the option is empty, then vim will use the system default printer for
":hardcopy!"

							*penc-option* *E620*
'printencoding' 'penc'	String	(default empty, except for:
					Windows, OS/2: cp1252,
					Macintosh: mac-roman,
					VMS: dec-mcs,
					HPUX: hp-roman8,
					EBCDIC: ebcdic-uk)
			global
Sets the character encoding used when printing.  This option tells VIM which
print character encoding file from the "print" directory in 'runtimepath' to
use.

This option will accept any value from |encoding-names|.  Any recognized names
are converted to VIM standard names - see 'encoding' for more details.  Names
not recognized by VIM will just be converted to lower case and underscores
replaced with '-' signs.

If 'printencoding' is empty or VIM cannot find the file then it will use
'encoding' (if VIM is compiled with |+multi_byte| and it is set an 8-bit
encoding) to find the print character encoding file.  If VIM is unable to find
a character encoding file then it will use the "latin1" print character
encoding file.

When 'encoding' is set to a multi-byte encoding, VIM will try to convert
characters to the printing encoding for printing (if 'printencoding' is empty
then the conversion will be to latin1).  Conversion to a printing encoding
other than latin1 will require VIM to be compiled with the |+iconv| feature.
If no conversion is possible then printing will fail.  Any characters that
cannot be converted will be replaced with upside down question marks.

Four print character encoding files are provided to support default Mac, VMS,
HPUX, and EBCDIC character encodings and are used by default on these
platforms.  Code page 1252 print character encoding is used by default on
Windows and OS/2 platforms.

							*pexpr-option*
'printexpr' 'pexpr'	String	(default: see below)
			global
Expression that is evaluated to print the PostScript produced with
|:hardcopy|.
The file name to be printed is in |v:fname_in|.
The arguments to the ":hardcopy" command are in |v:cmdarg|.
The expression must take care of deleting the file after printing it.
When there is an error, the expression must return a non-zero number.
If there is no error, return zero or an empty string.
The default for non MS-Windows or VMS systems is to simply use "lpr" to print
the file: >

    system('lpr' . (&printdevice == '' ? '' : ' -P' . &printdevice)
	. ' ' . v:fname_in) . delete(v:fname_in) + v:shell_error

On MS-Dos, MS-Windows and OS/2 machines the default is to copy the file to the
currently specified printdevice: >

    system('copy' . ' ' . v:fname_in . (&printdevice == ''
		? ' LPT1:' : (' \"' . &printdevice . '\"')))
		. delete(v:fname_in)

On VMS machines the default is to send the file to either the default or
currently specified printdevice: >

    system('print' . (&printdevice == '' ? '' : ' /queue=' .
		&printdevice) . ' ' . v:fname_in) . delete(v:fname_in)

If you change this option, using a function is an easy way to avoid having to
escape all the spaces.  Example: >

	:set printexpr=PrintFile(v:fname_in)
	:function PrintFile(fname)
	:  call system("ghostview " . a:fname)
	:  call delete(a:fname)
	:  return v:shell_error
	:endfunc

Be aware that some print programs return control before they have read the
file.  If you delete the file too soon it will not be printed.  These programs
usually offer an option to have them remove the file when printing is done.
							*E365*
If evaluating the expression fails or it results in a non-zero number, you get
an error message.  In that case Vim will delete the file.  In the default
value for non-MS-Windows a trick is used: Adding "v:shell_error" will result
in a non-zero number when the system() call fails.

This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for security
reasons.

							*pfn-option* *E613*
'printfont' 'pfn'	string	(default "courier")
			global
This is the name of the font that will be used for the |:hardcopy| command's
output.  It has the same format as the 'guifont' option, except that only one
font may be named, and the special "guifont=*" syntax is not available.

In the Win32 GUI version this specifies a font name with its extra attributes,
as with the 'guifont' option.

For other systems, only ":h11" is recognized, where "11" is the point size of
the font.  When omitted, the point size is 10.

							*pheader-option*
'printheader' 'pheader'  string  (default "%<%f%h%m%=Page %N")
			 global
This defines the format of the header produced in |:hardcopy| output.  The
option is defined in the same way as the 'statusline' option.  If Vim has not
been compiled with the |+statusline| feature, this option has no effect and a
simple default header is used, which shows the page number.  The same simple
header is used when this option is empty.

							*pmbcs-option*
'printmbcharset' 'pmbcs'  string (default "")
			  global
Sets the CJK character set to be used when generating CJK output from
|:hardcopy|.  The following predefined values are currently recognised by VIM:

		Value		Description ~
  Chinese	GB_2312-80
  (Simplified)	GBT_12345-90
		MAC		Apple Mac Simplified Chinese
		GBT-90_MAC	GB/T 12345-90 Apple Mac Simplified
				  Chinese
		GBK		GBK (GB 13000.1-93)
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

  Chinese	CNS_1993	CNS 11643-1993, Planes 1 & 2
  (Traditional)	BIG5
		ETEN		Big5 with ETen extensions
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

  Japanese	JIS_C_1978
		JIS_X_1983
		JIS_X_1990
		MSWINDOWS	Win3.1/95J (JIS X 1997 + NEC +
				  IBM extensions)
		KANJITALK6	Apple Mac KanjiTalk V6.x
		KANJITALK7	Apple Mac KanjiTalk V7.x

  Korean	KS_X_1992
		MAC		Apple Macintosh Korean
		MSWINDOWS	KS X 1992 with MS extensions
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

Only certain combinations of the above values and 'printencoding' are
possible.  The following tables show the valid combinations:

				euc-cn	 gbk	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Chinese	GB_2312-80	   x
  (Simplified)	GBT_12345-90	   x
		MAC		   x
		GBT-90_MAC	   x
		GBK			   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

				euc-tw	 big5	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Chinese	CNS_1993	   x
  (Traditional)	BIG5			   x
		ETEN			   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

				euc-jp	 sjis	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Japanese	JIS_C_1978	   x	   x
		JIS_X_1983	   x	   x
		JIS_X_1990	   x		  x	  x
		MSWINDOWS	   x
		KANJITALK6	   x
		KANJITALK7	   x

				euc-kr	 cp949	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Korean	KS_X_1992	   x
		MAC		   x
		MSWINDOWS		   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

To set up the correct encoding and character set for printing some
Japanese text you would do the following; >
	:set printencoding=euc-jp
	:set printmbcharset=JIS_X_1983

If 'printmbcharset' is not one of the above values then it is assumed to
specify a custom multi-byte character set and no check will be made that it is
compatible with the value for 'printencoding'.  VIM will look for a file
defining the character set in the "print" directory in 'runtimepath'.

							*pmbfn-option*
'printmbfont' 'pmbfn'	string (default "")
			global
This is a comma-separated list of fields for font names to be used when
generating CJK output from |:hardcopy|.  Each font name has to be preceded
with a letter indicating the style the font is to be used for as follows:

  r:{font-name}		font to use for normal characters
  b:{font-name}		font to use for bold characters
  i:{font-name}		font to use for italic characters
  o:{font-name}		font to use for bold-italic characters

A field with the r: prefix must be specified when doing CJK printing.  The
other fontname specifiers are optional.  If a specifier is missing then
another font will be used as follows:

  if b: is missing, then use r:
  if i: is missing, then use r:
  if o: is missing, then use b:

Some CJK fonts do not contain characters for codes in the ASCII code range.
Also, some characters in the CJK ASCII code ranges differ in a few code points
from traditional ASCII characters.  There are two additional fields to control
printing of characters in the ASCII code range.

  c:yes			Use Courier font for characters in the ASCII
  c:no (default)	code range.

  a:yes			Use ASCII character set for codes in the ASCII
  a:no (default)	code range.

The following is an example of specifying two multi-byte fonts, one for normal
and italic printing and one for bold and bold-italic printing, and using
Courier to print codes in the ASCII code range but using the national
character set: >
	:set printmbfont=r:WadaMin-Regular,b:WadaMin-Bold,c:yes
<
							*popt-option*
'printoptions' 'popt'	string (default "")
			global
This is a comma-separated list of items that control the format of the output
of |:hardcopy|:

  left:{spec}		left margin (default: 10pc)
  right:{spec}		right margin (default: 5pc)
  top:{spec}		top margin (default: 5pc)
  bottom:{spec}		bottom margin (default: 5pc)
			{spec} is a number followed by "in" for inches, "pt"
			for points (1 point is 1/72 of an inch), "mm" for
			millimeters or "pc" for a percentage of the media
			size.
			Weird example:
			    left:2in,top:30pt,right:16mm,bottom:3pc
			If the unit is not recognized there is no error and
			the default value is used.

  header:{nr}		Number of lines to reserve for the header.
			Only the first line is actually filled, thus when {nr}
			is 2 there is one empty line.  The header is formatted
			according to 'printheader'.
  header:0		Do not print a header.
  header:2  (default)	Use two lines for the header

  syntax:n		Do not use syntax highlighting.  This is faster and
			thus useful when printing large files.
  syntax:y		Do syntax highlighting.
  syntax:a  (default)	Use syntax highlighting if the printer appears to be
			able to print color or grey.

  number:y		Include line numbers in the printed output.
  number:n  (default)	No line numbers.

  wrap:y    (default)	Wrap long lines.
  wrap:n		Truncate long lines.

  duplex:off		Print on one side.
  duplex:long (default)	Print on both sides (when possible), bind on long
			side.
  duplex:short		Print on both sides (when possible), bind on short
			side.

==============================================================================
3. PostScript Printing					*postscript-printing*
						*E455* *E456* *E457* *E624*
Provided you have enough disk space there should be no problems generating a
PostScript file.  You need to have the runtime files correctly installed (if
you can find the help files, they probably are).

There are currently a number of limitations with PostScript printing:

- 'printfont' - The font name is ignored (the Courier family is always used -
  it should be available on all PostScript printers) but the font size is
  used.

- 'printoptions' - The duplex setting is used when generating PostScript
  output, but it is up to the printer to take notice of the setting.  If the
  printer does not support duplex printing then it should be silently ignored.
  Some printers, however, don't print at all.

- 8-bit support - While a number of 8-bit print character encodings are
  supported it is possible that some characters will not print.  Whether a
  character will print depends on the font in the printer knowing the
  character.  Missing characters will be replaced with an upside down question
  mark, or a space if that character is also not known by the font.  It may be
  possible to get all the characters in an encoding to print by installing a
  new version of the Courier font family.

- Multi-byte support - Currently VIM will try to convert multi-byte characters
  to the 8-bit encoding specified by 'printencoding' (or latin1 if it is
  empty).  Any characters that are not successfully converted are shown as
  unknown characters.  Printing will fail if VIM cannot convert the multi-byte
  to the 8-bit encoding.

==============================================================================
4. Custom 8-bit Print Character Encodings	*postscript-print-encoding*
								*E618* *E619*
To use your own print character encoding when printing 8-bit character data
you need to define your own PostScript font encoding vector.  Details on how
to define a font encoding vector is beyond the scope of this help file, but
you can find details in the PostScript Language Reference Manual, 3rd Edition,
published by Addison-Wesley and available in PDF form at
http://www.adobe.com/.  The following describes what you need to do for VIM to
locate and use your print character encoding.

i.   Decide on a unique name for your encoding vector, one that does not clash
     with any of the recognized or standard encoding names that VIM uses (see
     |encoding-names| for a list), and that no one else is likely to use.
ii.  Copy $VIMRUNTIME/print/latin1.ps to the print subdirectory in your
     'runtimepath' and rename it with your unique name.
iii. Edit your renamed copy of latin1.ps, replacing all occurrences of latin1
     with your unique name (don't forget the line starting %%Title:), and
     modify the array of glyph names to define your new encoding vector.  The
     array must have exactly 256 entries or you will not be able to print!
iv.  Within VIM, set 'printencoding' to your unique encoding name and then
     print your file.  VIM will now use your custom print character encoding.

VIM will report an error with the resource file if you change the order or
content of the first 3 lines, other than the name of the encoding on the line
starting %%Title: or the version number on the line starting %%Version:.

[Technical explanation for those that know PostScript - VIM looks for a file
with the same name as the encoding it will use when printing.  The file
defines a new PostScript Encoding resource called /VIM-name, where name is the
print character encoding VIM will use.]

==============================================================================
5. PostScript CJK Printing			*postscript-cjk-printing*
							*E673* *E674* *E675*

VIM supports printing of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean files.  Setting up VIM
to correctly print CJK files requires setting up a few more options.

Each of these countries has many standard character sets and encodings which
require that both be specified when printing.  In addition, CJK fonts normally
do not have the concept of italic glyphs and use different weight or stroke
style to achieve emphasis when printing.  This in turn requires a different
approach to specifying fonts to use when printing.

The encoding and character set are specified with the 'printencoding' and
'printmbcharset' options.  If 'printencoding' is not specified then 'encoding'
is used as normal.  If 'printencoding' is specified then characters will be
translated to this encoding for printing.  You should ensure that the encoding
is compatible with the character set needed for the file contents or some
characters may not appear when printed.

The fonts to use for CJK printing are specified with 'printmbfont'.  This
option allows you to specify different fonts to use when printing characters
which are syntax highlighted with the font styles normal, italic, bold and
bold-italic.

No CJK fonts are supplied with VIM.  There are some free Korean, Japanese, and
Traditional Chinese fonts available at:

  http://examples.oreilly.com/cjkvinfo/adobe/samples/

You can find descriptions of the various fonts in the read me file at

  http://examples.oreilly.de/english_examples/cjkvinfo/adobe/00README

Please read your printer documentation on how to install new fonts.

CJK fonts can be large containing several thousand glyphs, and it is not
uncommon to find that they only contain a subset of a national standard.  It
is not unusual to find the fonts to not include characters for codes in the
ASCII code range.  If you find half-width Roman characters are not appearing
in your printout then you should configure VIM to use the Courier font the
half-width ASCII characters with 'printmbfont'.  If your font does not include
other characters then you will need to find another font that does.

Another issue with ASCII characters, is that the various national character
sets specify a couple of different glyphs in the ASCII code range.  If you
print ASCII text using the national character set you may see some unexpected
characters.  If you want true ASCII code printing then you need to configure
VIM to output ASCII characters for the ASCII code range with 'printmbfont'.

It is possible to define your own multi-byte character set although this
should not be attempted lightly.  A discussion on the process if beyond the
scope of these help files.  You can find details on CMap (character map) files
in the document 'Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification, Version 1.0',
available from http://www.adobe.com as a PDF file.

==============================================================================
6. PostScript Printing Troubleshooting		*postscript-print-trouble*
									*E621*
Usually the only sign of a problem when printing with PostScript is that your
printout does not appear.  If you are lucky you may get a printed page that
tells you the PostScript operator that generated the error that prevented the
print job completing.

There are a number of possible causes as to why the printing may have failed:

- Wrong version of the prolog resource file.  The prolog resource file
  contains some PostScript that VIM needs to be able to print.  Each version
  of VIM needs one particular version.  Make sure you have correctly installed
  the runtime files, and don't have any old versions of a file called prolog
  in the print directory in your 'runtimepath' directory.

- Paper size.  Some PostScript printers will abort printing a file if they do
  not support the requested paper size.  By default VIM uses A4 paper.  Find
  out what size paper your printer normally uses and set the appropriate paper
  size with 'printoptions'.  If you cannot find the name of the paper used,
  measure a sheet and compare it with the table of supported paper sizes listed
  for 'printoptions', using the paper that is closest in both width AND height.
  Note: The dimensions of actual paper may vary slightly from the ones listed.
  If there is no paper listed close enough, then you may want to try psresize
  from PSUtils, discussed below.

- Two-sided printing (duplex).  Normally a PostScript printer that does not
  support two-sided printing will ignore any request to do it.  However, some
  printers may abort the job altogether.  Try printing with duplex turned off.
  Note: Duplex prints can be achieved manually using PS utils - see below.

- Collated printing.  As with Duplex printing, most PostScript printers that
  do not support collating printouts will ignore a request to do so.  Some may
  not.  Try printing with collation turned off.

- Syntax highlighting.  Some print management code may prevent the generated
  PostScript file from being printed on a black and white printer when syntax
  highlighting is turned on, even if solid black is the only color used.  Try
  printing with syntax highlighting turned off.

A safe printoptions setting to try is: >

	:set printoptions=paper:A4,duplex:off,collate:n,syntax:n

Replace "A4" with the paper size that best matches your printer paper.

==============================================================================
7. PostScript Utilities				*postscript-print-util*

7.1 Ghostscript

Ghostscript is a PostScript and PDF interpreter that can be used to display
and print on non-PostScript printers PostScript and PDF files.  It can also
generate PDF files from PostScript.

Ghostscript will run on a wide variety of platforms.

There are three available versions:

- AFPL Ghostscript (formerly Aladdin Ghostscript) which is free for
  non-commercial use.  It can be obtained from:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

- GNU Ghostscript which is available under the GNU General Public License.  It
  can be obtained from:

    ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/

- A commercial version for inclusion in commercial products.

Additional information on Ghostscript can also be found at:

  http://www.ghostscript.com/

Support for a number of non PostScript printers is provided in the
distribution as standard, but if you cannot find support for your printer
check the Ghostscript site for other printers not included by default.


7.2 Ghostscript Previewers.

The interface to Ghostscript is very primitive so a number of graphical front
ends have been created.  These allow easier PostScript file selection,
previewing at different zoom levels, and printing.  Check supplied
documentation for full details.

X11

- Ghostview.  Obtainable from:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gv/

- gv.  Derived from Ghostview.  Obtainable from:

    http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/

  Copies (possibly not the most recent) can be found at:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gv/

OpenVMS

- Is apparently supported in the main code now (untested).  See:

    http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/

Windows and OS/2

- GSview.  Obtainable from:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/

DOS

- ps_view.  Obtainable from:

    ftp://ftp.pg.gda.pl/pub/TeX/support/ps_view/
    ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/ps_view/

Linux

- GSview.  Linux version of the popular Windows and OS/2 previewer.
  Obtainable from:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/

- BMV.  Different from Ghostview and gv in that it doesn't use X but svgalib.
  Obtainable from:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/svga/bmv-1.2.tgz


7.3 PSUtils

PSUtils is a collection of utility programs for manipulating PostScript
documents.  Binary distributions are available for many platforms, as well as
the full source.  PSUtils can be found at:

  http://knackered.org/angus/psutils

The utilities of interest include:

- psnup.     Convert PS files for N-up printing.
- psselect.  Select page range and order of printing.
- psresize.  Change the page size.
- psbook.    Reorder and lay out pages ready for making a book.

The output of one program can be used as the input to the next, allowing for
complex print document creation.


N-UP PRINTING

The psnup utility takes an existing PostScript file generated from VIM and
convert it to an n-up version.  The simplest way to create a 2-up printout is
to first create a PostScript file with: >

	:hardcopy > test.ps

Then on your command line execute: >

	psnup -n 2 test.ps final.ps

Note: You may get warnings from some Ghostscript previewers for files produced
by psnup - these may safely be ignored.

Finally print the file final.ps to your PostScript printer with your
platform's print command.  (You will need to delete the two PostScript files
afterwards yourself.)  'printexpr' could be modified to perform this extra
step before printing.


ALTERNATE DUPLEX PRINTING

It is possible to achieve a poor man's version of duplex printing using the PS
utility psselect.  This utility has options -e and -o for printing just the
even or odd pages of a PS file respectively.

First generate a PS file with the 'hardcopy' command, then generate a new
files with all the odd and even numbered pages with: >

	psselect -o test.ps odd.ps
	psselect -e test.ps even.ps

Next print odd.ps with your platform's normal print command.  Then take the
print output, turn it over and place it back in the paper feeder.  Now print
even.ps with your platform's print command.  All the even pages should now
appear on the back of the odd pages.

There are a couple of points to bear in mind:

1. Position of the first page.  If the first page is on top of the printout
   when printing the odd pages then you need to reverse the order that the odd
   pages are printed.  This can be done with the -r option to psselect.  This
   will ensure page 2 is printed on the back of page 1.
   Note: it is better to reverse the odd numbered pages rather than the even
   numbered in case there are an odd number of pages in the original PS file.

2. Paper flipping.  When turning over the paper with the odd pages printed on
   them you may have to either flip them horizontally (along the long edge) or
   vertically (along the short edge), as well as possibly rotating them 180
   degrees.  All this depends on the printer - it will be more obvious for
   desktop ink jets than for small office laser printers where the paper path
   is hidden from view.


==============================================================================
8. Formfeed Characters					*printing-formfeed*

By default VIM does not do any special processing of |formfeed| control
characters.  Setting the 'printoptions' formfeed item will make VIM recognize
formfeed characters and continue printing the current line at the beginning
of the first line on a new page.  The use of formfeed characters provides
rudimentary print control but there are certain things to be aware of.

VIM will always start printing a line (including a line number if enabled)
containing a formfeed character, even if it is the first character on the
line.  This means if a line starting with a formfeed character is the first
line of a page then VIM will print a blank page.

Since the line number is printed at the start of printing the line containing
the formfeed character, the remainder of the line printed on the new page
will not have a line number printed for it (in the same way as the wrapped
lines of a long line when wrap in 'printoptions' is enabled).

If the formfeed character is the last character on a line, then printing will
continue on the second line of the new page, not the first.  This is due to
VIM processing the end of the line after the formfeed character and moving
down a line to continue printing.

Due to the points made above it is recommended that when formfeed character
processing is enabled, printing of line numbers is disabled, and that form
feed characters are not the last character on a line.  Even then you may need
to adjust the number of lines before a formfeed character to prevent
accidental blank pages.

Last change: 2014 Mar 27


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This subject is introduced in section |30.1| of the user manual.

1. Using QuickFix commands		|quickfix|
2. The error window			|quickfix-window|
3. Using more than one list of errors	|quickfix-error-lists|
4. Using :make				|:make_makeprg|
5. Using :grep				|grep|
6. Selecting a compiler			|compiler-select|
7. The error format			|error-file-format|
8. The directory stack			|quickfix-directory-stack|
9. Specific error file formats		|errorformats|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The quickfix commands are not available when the |+quickfix| feature was
disabled at compile time.

=============================================================================
1. Using QuickFix commands			*quickfix* *Quickfix* *E42*

Vim has a special mode to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  This is
inspired by the quickfix option of the Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga.
The idea is to save the error messages from the compiler in a file and use Vim
to jump to the errors one by one.  You can examine each problem and fix it,
without having to remember all the error messages.

In Vim the quickfix commands are used more generally to find a list of
positions in files.  For example, |:vimgrep| finds pattern matches.  You can
use the positions in a script with the |getqflist()| function.  Thus you can
do a lot more than the edit/compile/fix cycle!

If you are using Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga look here for how to use
it with Vim: |quickfix-manx|.  If you are using another compiler you should
save the error messages in a file and start Vim with "vim -q filename".  An
easy way to do this is with the |:make| command (see below).  The
'errorformat' option should be set to match the error messages from your
compiler (see |errorformat| below).

						*location-list* *E776*
A location list is similar to a quickfix list and contains a list of positions
in files.  A location list is associated with a window and each window can
have a separate location list.  A location list can be associated with only
one window.  The location list is independent of the quickfix list.

When a window with a location list is split, the new window gets a copy of the
location list.  When there are no references to a location list, the location
list is destroyed.

The following quickfix commands can be used.  The location list commands are
similar to the quickfix commands, replacing the 'c' prefix in the quickfix
command with 'l'.

							*:cc*
:cc[!] [nr]		Display error [nr].  If [nr] is omitted, the same
			error is displayed again.  Without [!] this doesn't
			work when jumping to another buffer, the current buffer
			has been changed, there is the only window for the
			buffer and both 'hidden' and 'autowrite' are off.
			When jumping to another buffer with [!] any changes to
			the current buffer are lost, unless 'hidden' is set or
			there is another window for this buffer.
			The 'switchbuf' settings are respected when jumping
			to a buffer.

							*:ll*
:ll[!] [nr]		Same as ":cc", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cn* *:cnext* *E553*
:[count]cn[ext][!]	Display the [count] next error in the list that
			includes a file name.  If there are no file names at
			all, go to the [count] next error.  See |:cc| for
			[!] and 'switchbuf'.

							*:lne* *:lnext*
:[count]lne[xt][!]	Same as ":cnext", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

:[count]cN[ext][!]			*:cp* *:cprevious* *:cN* *:cNext*
:[count]cp[revious][!]	Display the [count] previous error in the list that
			includes a file name.  If there are no file names at
			all, go to the [count] previous error.  See |:cc| for
			[!] and 'switchbuf'.


:[count]lN[ext][!]			*:lp* *:lprevious* *:lN* *:lNext*
:[count]lp[revious][!]	Same as ":cNext" and ":cprevious", except the location
			list for the current window is used instead of the
			quickfix list.

							*:cnf* *:cnfile*
:[count]cnf[ile][!]	Display the first error in the [count] next file in
			the list that includes a file name.  If there are no
			file names at all or if there is no next file, go to
			the [count] next error.  See |:cc| for [!] and
			'switchbuf'.

							*:lnf* *:lnfile*
:[count]lnf[ile][!]	Same as ":cnfile", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

:[count]cNf[ile][!]			*:cpf* *:cpfile* *:cNf* *:cNfile*
:[count]cpf[ile][!]	Display the last error in the [count] previous file in
			the list that includes a file name.  If there are no
			file names at all or if there is no next file, go to
			the [count] previous error.  See |:cc| for [!] and
			'switchbuf'.


:[count]lNf[ile][!]			*:lpf* *:lpfile* *:lNf* *:lNfile*
:[count]lpf[ile][!]	Same as ":cNfile" and ":cpfile", except the location
			list for the current window is used instead of the
			quickfix list.

							*:crewind* *:cr*
:cr[ewind][!] [nr]	Display error [nr].  If [nr] is omitted, the FIRST
			error is displayed.  See |:cc|.

							*:lrewind* *:lr*
:lr[ewind][!] [nr]	Same as ":crewind", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cfirst* *:cfir*
:cfir[st][!] [nr]	Same as ":crewind".

							*:lfirst* *:lfir*
:lfir[st][!] [nr]	Same as ":lrewind".

							*:clast* *:cla*
:cla[st][!] [nr]	Display error [nr].  If [nr] is omitted, the LAST
			error is displayed.  See |:cc|.

							*:llast* *:lla*
:lla[st][!] [nr]	Same as ":clast", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cq* *:cquit*
:cq[uit][!]		Quit Vim with an error code, so that the compiler
			will not compile the same file again.
			WARNING: All changes in files are lost!  Also when the
			[!] is not used.  It works like ":qall!" |:qall|,
			except that Vim returns a non-zero exit code.

							*:cf* *:cfile*
:cf[ile][!] [errorfile]	Read the error file and jump to the first error.
			This is done automatically when Vim is started with
			the -q option.  You can use this command when you
			keep Vim running while compiling.  If you give the
			name of the errorfile, the 'errorfile' option will
			be set to [errorfile].  See |:cc| for [!].

							*:lf* *:lfile*
:lf[ile][!] [errorfile]	Same as ":cfile", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.
			You can not use the -q command-line option to set
			the location list.


:cg[etfile] [errorfile]					*:cg* *:cgetfile*
			Read the error file.  Just like ":cfile" but don't
			jump to the first error.


:lg[etfile] [errorfile]					*:lg* *:lgetfile*
			Same as ":cgetfile", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:caddf* *:caddfile*
:caddf[ile] [errorfile]	Read the error file and add the errors from the
			errorfile to the current quickfix list. If a quickfix
			list is not present, then a new list is created.

							*:laddf* *:laddfile*
:laddf[ile] [errorfile]	Same as ":caddfile", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

						*:cb* *:cbuffer* *E681*
:cb[uffer][!] [bufnr]	Read the error list from the current buffer.
			When [bufnr] is given it must be the number of a
			loaded buffer.  That buffer will then be used instead
			of the current buffer.
			A range can be specified for the lines to be used.
			Otherwise all lines in the buffer are used.
			See |:cc| for [!].

						*:lb* *:lbuffer*
:lb[uffer][!] [bufnr]	Same as ":cbuffer", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

						*:cgetb* *:cgetbuffer*
:cgetb[uffer] [bufnr]	Read the error list from the current buffer.  Just
			like ":cbuffer" but don't jump to the first error.

						*:lgetb* *:lgetbuffer*
:lgetb[uffer] [bufnr]	Same as ":cgetbuffer", except the location list for
			the current window is used instead of the quickfix
			list.

							*:cad* *:caddbuffer*
:cad[dbuffer] [bufnr]	Read the error list from the current buffer and add
			the errors to the current quickfix list.  If a
			quickfix list is not present, then a new list is
			created. Otherwise, same as ":cbuffer".

							*:laddb* *:laddbuffer*
:laddb[uffer] [bufnr]	Same as ":caddbuffer", except the location list for
			the current window is used instead of the quickfix
			list.

							*:cex* *:cexpr* *E777*
:cex[pr][!] {expr}	Create a quickfix list using the result of {expr} and
			jump to the first error.
			If {expr} is a String, then each new-line terminated
			line in the String is processed using the global value
			of 'errorformat' and the result is added to the
			quickfix list.
			If {expr} is a List, then each String item in the list
			is processed and added to the quickfix list.  Non
			String items in the List are ignored.
			See |:cc| for [!].
			Examples: >
				:cexpr system('grep -n xyz *')
				:cexpr getline(1, '$')
<
							*:lex* *:lexpr*
:lex[pr][!] {expr}	Same as |:cexpr|, except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cgete* *:cgetexpr*
:cgete[xpr] {expr}	Create a quickfix list using the result of {expr}.
			Just like |:cexpr|, but don't jump to the first error.

							*:lgete* *:lgetexpr*
:lgete[xpr] {expr}	Same as |:cgetexpr|, except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cadde* *:caddexpr*
:cadde[xpr] {expr}	Evaluate {expr} and add the resulting lines to the
			current quickfix list. If a quickfix list is not
			present, then a new list is created. The current
			cursor position will not be changed. See |:cexpr| for
			more information.
			Example: >
    :g/mypattern/caddexpr expand("%") . ":" . line(".") .  ":" . getline(".")
<
							*:lad* *:laddexpr*
:lad[dexpr] {expr}	Same as ":caddexpr", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:cl* *:clist*
:cl[ist] [from] [, [to]]
			List all errors that are valid |quickfix-valid|.
			If numbers [from] and/or [to] are given, the respective
			range of errors is listed.  A negative number counts
			from the last error backwards, -1 being the last error.
			The 'switchbuf' settings are respected when jumping
			to a buffer.

:cl[ist]! [from] [, [to]]
			List all errors.

							*:lli* *:llist*
:lli[st] [from] [, [to]]
			Same as ":clist", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

:lli[st]! [from] [, [to]]
			List all the entries in the location list for the
			current window.

If you insert or delete lines, mostly the correct error location is still
found because hidden marks are used.  Sometimes, when the mark has been
deleted for some reason, the message "line changed" is shown to warn you that
the error location may not be correct.  If you quit Vim and start again the
marks are lost and the error locations may not be correct anymore.

If vim is built with |+autocmd| support, two autocommands are available for
running commands before and after a quickfix command (':make', ':grep' and so
on) is executed. See |QuickFixCmdPre| and |QuickFixCmdPost| for details.

						*QuickFixCmdPost-example*
When 'encoding' differs from the locale, the error messages may have a
different encoding from what Vim is using.  To convert the messages you can
use this code: >
	function QfMakeConv()
	   let qflist = getqflist()
	   for i in qflist
	      let i.text = iconv(i.text, "cp936", "utf-8")
	   endfor
	   call setqflist(qflist)
	endfunction

	au QuickfixCmdPost make call QfMakeConv()


=============================================================================
2. The error window					*quickfix-window*

					    *:cope* *:copen* *w:quickfix_title*
:cope[n] [height]	Open a window to show the current list of errors.

			When [height] is given, the window becomes that high
			(if there is room).  When [height] is omitted the
			window is made ten lines high.

			If there already is a quickfix window, it will be made
			the current window.  It is not possible to open a
			second quickfix window.  If [height] is given the
			existing window will be resized to it.

			The window will contain a special buffer, with
			'buftype' equal to "quickfix".  Don't change this!
			The window will have the w:quickfix_title variable set
			which will indicate the command that produced the
			quickfix list. This can be used to compose a custom
			status line if the value of 'statusline' is adjusted
			properly.

							*:lop* *:lopen*
:lop[en] [height]	Open a window to show the location list for the
			current window. Works only when the location list for
			the current window is present.  You can have more than
			one location window opened at a time.  Otherwise, it
			acts the same as ":copen".

							*:ccl* *:cclose*
:ccl[ose]		Close the quickfix window.

							*:lcl* *:lclose*
:lcl[ose]		Close the window showing the location list for the
			current window.

							*:cw* *:cwindow*
:cw[indow] [height]	Open the quickfix window when there are recognized
			errors.  If the window is already open and there are
			no recognized errors, close the window.

							*:lw* *:lwindow*
:lw[indow] [height]	Same as ":cwindow", except use the window showing the
			location list for the current window.

Normally the quickfix window is at the bottom of the screen.  If there are
vertical splits, it's at the bottom of the rightmost column of windows.  To
make it always occupy the full width: >
	:botright cwindow
You can move the window around with |window-moving| commands.
For example, to move it to the top: CTRL-W K
The 'winfixheight' option will be set, which means that the window will mostly
keep its height, ignoring 'winheight' and 'equalalways'.  You can change the
height manually (e.g., by dragging the status line above it with the mouse).

In the quickfix window, each line is one error.  The line number is equal to
the error number.  You can use ":.cc" to jump to the error under the cursor.
Hitting the <Enter> key or double-clicking the mouse on a line has the same
effect.  The file containing the error is opened in the window above the
quickfix window.  If there already is a window for that file, it is used
instead.  If the buffer in the used window has changed, and the error is in
another file, jumping to the error will fail.  You will first have to make
sure the window contains a buffer which can be abandoned.
					*CTRL-W_<Enter>* *CTRL-W_<CR>*
You can use CTRL-W <Enter> to open a new window and jump to the error there.

When the quickfix window has been filled, two autocommand events are
triggered.  First the 'filetype' option is set to "qf", which triggers the
FileType event.  Then the BufReadPost event is triggered, using "quickfix" for
the buffer name.  This can be used to perform some action on the listed
errors.  Example: >
	au BufReadPost quickfix  setlocal modifiable
		\ | silent exe 'g/^/s//\=line(".")." "/'
		\ | setlocal nomodifiable
This prepends the line number to each line.  Note the use of "\=" in the
substitute string of the ":s" command, which is used to evaluate an
expression.
The BufWinEnter event is also triggered, again using "quickfix" for the buffer
name.

Note: Making changes in the quickfix window has no effect on the list of
errors.  'modifiable' is off to avoid making changes.  If you delete or insert
lines anyway, the relation between the text and the error number is messed up.
If you really want to do this, you could write the contents of the quickfix
window to a file and use ":cfile" to have it parsed and used as the new error
list.

						*location-list-window*
The location list window displays the entries in a location list.  When you
open a location list window, it is created below the current window and
displays the location list for the current window.  The location list window
is similar to the quickfix window, except that you can have more than one
location list window open at a time. When you use a location list command in
this window, the displayed location list is used.

When you select a file from the location list window, the following steps are
used to find a window to edit the file:

1. If a window with the location list displayed in the location list window is
   present, then the file is opened in that window.
2. If the above step fails and if the file is already opened in another
   window, then that window is used.
3. If the above step fails then an existing window showing a buffer with
   'buftype' not set is used.
4. If the above step fails, then the file is edited in a new window.

In all of the above cases, if the location list for the selected window is not
yet set, then it is set to the location list displayed in the location list
window.

=============================================================================
3. Using more than one list of errors			*quickfix-error-lists*

So far has been assumed that there is only one list of errors.  Actually the
ten last used lists are remembered.  When starting a new list, the previous
ones are automatically kept.  Two commands can be used to access older error
lists.  They set one of the existing error lists as the current one.

						*:colder* *:col* *E380*
:col[der] [count]	Go to older error list.  When [count] is given, do
			this [count] times.  When already at the oldest error
			list, an error message is given.

						*:lolder* *:lol*
:lol[der] [count]	Same as ":colder", except use the location list for
			the current window instead of the quickfix list.

						*:cnewer* *:cnew* *E381*
:cnew[er] [count]	Go to newer error list.  When [count] is given, do
			this [count] times.  When already at the newest error
			list, an error message is given.

						*:lnewer* *:lnew*
:lnew[er] [count]	Same as ":cnewer", except use the location list for
			the current window instead of the quickfix list.

When adding a new error list, it becomes the current list.

When ":colder" has been used and ":make" or ":grep" is used to add a new error
list, one newer list is overwritten.  This is especially useful if you are
browsing with ":grep" |grep|.  If you want to keep the more recent error
lists, use ":cnewer 99" first.

=============================================================================
4. Using :make						*:make_makeprg*

							*:mak* *:make*
:mak[e][!] [arguments]	1. If vim was built with |+autocmd|, all relevant
			   |QuickFixCmdPre| autocommands are executed.
			2. If the 'autowrite' option is on, write any changed
			   buffers
			3. An errorfile name is made from 'makeef'.  If
			   'makeef' doesn't contain "##", and a file with this
			   name already exists, it is deleted.
			4. The program given with the 'makeprg' option is
			   started (default "make") with the optional
			   [arguments] and the output is saved in the
			   errorfile (for Unix it is also echoed on the
			   screen).
			5. The errorfile is read using 'errorformat'.
			6. If vim was built with |+autocmd|, all relevant
			   |QuickFixCmdPost| autocommands are executed.
			   See example below.
			7. If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.
			8. The errorfile is deleted.
			9. You can now move through the errors with commands
			   like |:cnext| and |:cprevious|, see above.
			This command does not accept a comment, any "
			characters are considered part of the arguments.

							*:lmak* *:lmake*
:lmak[e][!] [arguments]
			Same as ":make", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

The ":make" command executes the command given with the 'makeprg' option.
This is done by passing the command to the shell given with the 'shell'
option.  This works almost like typing

	":!{makeprg} [arguments] {shellpipe} {errorfile}".

{makeprg} is the string given with the 'makeprg' option.  Any command can be
used, not just "make".  Characters '%' and '#' are expanded as usual on a
command-line.  You can use "%<" to insert the current file name without
extension, or "#<" to insert the alternate file name without extension, for
example: >
   :set makeprg=make\ #<.o

[arguments] is anything that is typed after ":make".
{shellpipe} is the 'shellpipe' option.
{errorfile} is the 'makeef' option, with ## replaced to make it unique.

The placeholder "$*" can be used for the argument list in {makeprg} if the
command needs some additional characters after its arguments.  The $* is
replaced then by all arguments.  Example: >
   :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
or simpler >
   :let &mp = 'latex \\nonstopmode \\input\{$*}'
"$*" can be given multiple times, for example: >
   :set makeprg=gcc\ -o\ $*\ $*

The 'shellpipe' option defaults to ">" for the Amiga, MS-DOS and Win32.  This
means that the output of the compiler is saved in a file and not shown on the
screen directly.  For Unix "| tee" is used.  The compiler output is shown on
the screen and saved in a file the same time.  Depending on the shell used
"|& tee" or "2>&1| tee" is the default, so stderr output will be included.

If 'shellpipe' is empty, the {errorfile} part will be omitted.  This is useful
for compilers that write to an errorfile themselves (e.g., Manx's Amiga C).


Using QuickFixCmdPost to fix the encoding ~

It may be that 'encoding' is set to an encoding that differs from the messages
your build program produces.  This example shows how to fix this after Vim has
read the error messages: >

	function QfMakeConv()
	   let qflist = getqflist()
	   for i in qflist
	      let i.text = iconv(i.text, "cp936", "utf-8")
	   endfor
	   call setqflist(qflist)
	endfunction

	au QuickfixCmdPost make call QfMakeConv()

(Example by Faque Cheng)

==============================================================================
5. Using :vimgrep and :grep				*grep* *lid*

Vim has two ways to find matches for a pattern: Internal and external.  The
advantage of the internal grep is that it works on all systems and uses the
powerful Vim search patterns.  An external grep program can be used when the
Vim grep does not do what you want.

The internal method will be slower, because files are read into memory.  The
advantages are:
- Line separators and encoding are automatically recognized, as if a file is
  being edited.
- Uses Vim search patterns.  Multi-line patterns can be used.
- When plugins are enabled: compressed and remote files can be searched.
	|gzip| |netrw|

To be able to do this Vim loads each file as if it is being edited.  When
there is no match in the file the associated buffer is wiped out again.  The
'hidden' option is ignored here to avoid running out of memory or file
descriptors when searching many files.  However, when the |:hide| command
modifier is used the buffers are kept loaded.  This makes following searches
in the same files a lot faster.

Note that |:copen| (or |:lopen| for |:lgrep|) may be used to open a buffer
containing the search results in linked form.  The |:silent| command may be
used to suppress the default full screen grep output.  The ":grep!" form of
the |:grep| command doesn't jump to the first match automatically.  These
commands can be combined to create a NewGrep command: >

        command! -nargs=+ NewGrep execute 'silent grep! <args>' | copen 42


5.1 using Vim's internal grep

					*:vim* *:vimgrep* *E682* *E683*
:vim[grep][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
			Search for {pattern} in the files {file} ... and set
			the error list to the matches.  Files matching
			'wildignore' are ignored; files in 'suffixes' are
			searched last.
			Without the 'g' flag each line is added only once.
			With 'g' every match is added.

			{pattern} is a Vim search pattern.  Instead of
			enclosing it in / any non-ID character (see
			|'isident'|) can be used, so long as it does not
			appear in {pattern}.
			'ignorecase' applies.  To overrule it put |/\c| in the
			pattern to ignore case or |/\C| to match case.
			'smartcase' is not used.
			If {pattern} is empty (e.g. // is specified), the last
			used search pattern is used. |last-pattern|

			When a number is put before the command this is used
			as the maximum number of matches to find.  Use
			":1vimgrep pattern file" to find only the first.
			Useful if you only want to check if there is a match
			and quit quickly when it's found.

			Without the 'j' flag Vim jumps to the first match.
			With 'j' only the quickfix list is updated.
			With the [!] any changes in the current buffer are
			abandoned.

			Every second or so the searched file name is displayed
			to give you an idea of the progress made.
			Examples: >
				:vimgrep /an error/ *.c
				:vimgrep /\<FileName\>/ *.h include/*
				:vimgrep /myfunc/ **/*.c
<			For the use of "**" see |starstar-wildcard|.

:vim[grep][!] {pattern} {file} ...
			Like above, but instead of enclosing the pattern in a
			non-ID character use a white-separated pattern.  The
			pattern must start with an ID character.
			Example: >
				:vimgrep Error *.c
<
							*:lv* *:lvimgrep*
:lv[imgrep][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
:lv[imgrep][!] {pattern} {file} ...
			Same as ":vimgrep", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

						*:vimgrepa* *:vimgrepadd*
:vimgrepa[dd][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
:vimgrepa[dd][!] {pattern} {file} ...
			Just like ":vimgrep", but instead of making a new list
			of errors the matches are appended to the current
			list.

						*:lvimgrepa* *:lvimgrepadd*
:lvimgrepa[dd][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
:lvimgrepa[dd][!] {pattern} {file} ...
			Same as ":vimgrepadd", except the location list for
			the current window is used instead of the quickfix
			list.

5.2 External grep

Vim can interface with "grep" and grep-like programs (such as the GNU
id-utils) in a similar way to its compiler integration (see |:make| above).

[Unix trivia: The name for the Unix "grep" command comes from ":g/re/p", where
"re" stands for Regular Expression.]

							    *:gr* *:grep*
:gr[ep][!] [arguments]	Just like ":make", but use 'grepprg' instead of
			'makeprg' and 'grepformat' instead of 'errorformat'.
			When 'grepprg' is "internal" this works like
			|:vimgrep|.  Note that the pattern needs to be
			enclosed in separator characters then.

							    *:lgr* *:lgrep*
:lgr[ep][!] [arguments]	Same as ":grep", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

							*:grepa* *:grepadd*
:grepa[dd][!] [arguments]
			Just like ":grep", but instead of making a new list of
			errors the matches are appended to the current list.
			Example: >
				:call setqflist([])
				:bufdo grepadd! something %
<			The first command makes a new error list which is
			empty.  The second command executes "grepadd" for each
			listed buffer.  Note the use of ! to avoid that
			":grepadd" jumps to the first error, which is not
			allowed with |:bufdo|.
			An example that uses the argument list and avoids
			errors for files without matches: >
                                :silent argdo try 
				  \ | grepadd! something %
				  \ | catch /E480:/
				  \ | endtry"
<
							*:lgrepa* *:lgrepadd*
:lgrepa[dd][!] [arguments]
			Same as ":grepadd", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

5.3 Setting up external grep

If you have a standard "grep" program installed, the :grep command may work
well with the defaults.  The syntax is very similar to the standard command: >

	:grep foo *.c

Will search all files with the .c extension for the substring "foo".  The
arguments to :grep are passed straight to the "grep" program, so you can use
whatever options your "grep" supports.

By default, :grep invokes grep with the -n option (show file and line
numbers).  You can change this with the 'grepprg' option.  You will need to set
'grepprg' if:

a)	You are using a program that isn't called "grep"
b)	You have to call grep with a full path
c)	You want to pass other options automatically (e.g. case insensitive
	search.)

Once "grep" has executed, Vim parses the results using the 'grepformat'
option.  This option works in the same way as the 'errorformat' option - see
that for details.  You may need to change 'grepformat' from the default if
your grep outputs in a non-standard format, or you are using some other
program with a special format.

Once the results are parsed, Vim loads the first file containing a match and
jumps to the appropriate line, in the same way that it jumps to a compiler
error in |quickfix| mode.  You can then use the |:cnext|, |:clist|, etc.
commands to see the other matches.


5.4 Using :grep with id-utils

You can set up :grep to work with the GNU id-utils like this: >

	:set grepprg=lid\ -Rgrep\ -s
	:set grepformat=%f:%l:%m

then >
	:grep (regexp)

works just as you'd expect.
(provided you remembered to mkid first :)


5.5 Browsing source code with :vimgrep or :grep

Using the stack of error lists that Vim keeps, you can browse your files to
look for functions and the functions they call.  For example, suppose that you
have to add an argument to the read_file() function.  You enter this command: >

	:vimgrep /\<read_file\>/ *.c

You use ":cn" to go along the list of matches and add the argument.  At one
place you have to get the new argument from a higher level function msg(), and
need to change that one too.  Thus you use: >

	:vimgrep /\<msg\>/ *.c

While changing the msg() functions, you find another function that needs to
get the argument from a higher level.  You can again use ":vimgrep" to find
these functions.  Once you are finished with one function, you can use >

	:colder

to go back to the previous one.

This works like browsing a tree: ":vimgrep" goes one level deeper, creating a
list of branches.  ":colder" goes back to the previous level.  You can mix
this use of ":vimgrep" and "colder" to browse all the locations in a tree-like
way.  If you do this consistently, you will find all locations without the
need to write down a "todo" list.

=============================================================================
6. Selecting a compiler					*compiler-select*

						*:comp* *:compiler* *E666*
:comp[iler][!] {name}		Set options to work with compiler {name}.
				Without the "!" options are set for the
				current buffer.  With "!" global options are
				set.
				If you use ":compiler foo" in "file.foo" and
				then ":compiler! bar" in another buffer, Vim
				will keep on using "foo" in "file.foo".
				{not available when compiled without the
				|+eval| feature}


The Vim plugins in the "compiler" directory will set options to use the
selected compiler.  For ":compiler" local options are set, for ":compiler!"
global options.
							*current_compiler*
To support older Vim versions, the plugins always use "current_compiler" and
not "b:current_compiler".  What the command actually does is the following:

- Delete the "current_compiler" and "b:current_compiler" variables.
- Define the "CompilerSet" user command.  With "!" it does ":set", without "!"
  it does ":setlocal".
- Execute ":runtime! compiler/{name}.vim".  The plugins are expected to set
  options with "CompilerSet" and set the "current_compiler" variable to the
  name of the compiler.
- Delete the "CompilerSet" user command.
- Set "b:current_compiler" to the value of "current_compiler".
- Without "!" the old value of "current_compiler" is restored.


For writing a compiler plugin, see |write-compiler-plugin|.


GCC					*quickfix-gcc*	*compiler-gcc*

There's one variable you can set for the GCC compiler:

g:compiler_gcc_ignore_unmatched_lines
				Ignore lines that don't match any patterns
				defined for GCC.  Useful if output from
				commands run from make are generating false
				positives.


MANX AZTEC C				*quickfix-manx* *compiler-manx*

To use Vim with Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga you should do the
following:
- Set the CCEDIT environment variable with the command: >
	mset "CCEDIT=vim -q"
- Compile with the -qf option.  If the compiler finds any errors, Vim is
  started and the cursor is positioned on the first error.  The error message
  will be displayed on the last line.  You can go to other errors with the
  commands mentioned above.  You can fix the errors and write the file(s).
- If you exit Vim normally the compiler will re-compile the same file.  If you
  exit with the :cq command, the compiler will terminate.  Do this if you
  cannot fix the error, or if another file needs to be compiled first.

There are some restrictions to the Quickfix mode on the Amiga.  The
compiler only writes the first 25 errors to the errorfile (Manx's
documentation does not say how to get more).  If you want to find the others,
you will have to fix a few errors and exit the editor.  After recompiling,
up to 25 remaining errors will be found.

If Vim was started from the compiler, the :sh and some :!  commands will not
work, because Vim is then running in the same process as the compiler and
stdin (standard input) will not be interactive.


PERL					*quickfix-perl* *compiler-perl*

The Perl compiler plugin doesn't actually compile, but invokes Perl's internal
syntax checking feature and parses the output for possible errors so you can
correct them in quick-fix mode.

Warnings are forced regardless of "no warnings" or "$^W = 0" within the file
being checked.  To disable this set g:perl_compiler_force_warnings to a zero
value.  For example: >
	let g:perl_compiler_force_warnings = 0


PYUNIT COMPILER						*compiler-pyunit*

This is not actually a compiler, but a unit testing framework for the
Python language.  It is included into standard Python distribution
starting from version 2.0.  For older versions, you can get it from
http://pyunit.sourceforge.net.

When you run your tests with the help of the framework, possible errors
are parsed by Vim and presented for you in quick-fix mode.

Unfortunately, there is no standard way to run the tests.
The alltests.py script seems to be used quite often, that's all.
Useful values for the 'makeprg' options therefore are:
 setlocal makeprg=./alltests.py " Run a testsuite
 setlocal makeprg=python\ %:S   " Run a single testcase

Also see http://vim.sourceforge.net/tip_view.php?tip_id=280.


TEX COMPILER						*compiler-tex*

Included in the distribution compiler for TeX ($VIMRUNTIME/compiler/tex.vim)
uses make command if possible.  If the compiler finds a file named "Makefile"
or "makefile" in the current directory, it supposes that you want to process
your *TeX files with make, and the makefile does the right work.  In this case
compiler sets 'errorformat' for *TeX output and leaves 'makeprg' untouched.  If
neither "Makefile" nor "makefile" is found, the compiler will not use make.
You can force the compiler to ignore makefiles by defining
b:tex_ignore_makefile or g:tex_ignore_makefile variable (they are checked for
existence only).

If the compiler chose not to use make, it need to choose a right program for
processing your input.  If b:tex_flavor or g:tex_flavor (in this precedence)
variable exists, it defines TeX flavor for :make (actually, this is the name
of executed command), and if both variables do not exist, it defaults to
"latex".  For example, while editing chapter2.tex \input-ed from mypaper.tex
written in AMS-TeX: >

	:let b:tex_flavor = 'amstex'
	:compiler tex
<	[editing...] >
	:make mypaper

Note that you must specify a name of the file to process as an argument (to
process the right file when editing \input-ed or \include-ed file; portable
solution for substituting % for no arguments is welcome).  This is not in the
semantics of make, where you specify a target, not source, but you may specify
filename without extension ".tex" and mean this as "make filename.dvi or
filename.pdf or filename.some_result_extension according to compiler".

Note: tex command line syntax is set to usable both for MikTeX (suggestion
by Srinath Avadhanula) and teTeX (checked by Artem Chuprina).  Suggestion
from |errorformat-LaTeX| is too complex to keep it working for different
shells and OSes and also does not allow to use other available TeX options,
if any.  If your TeX doesn't support "-interaction=nonstopmode", please
report it with different means to express \nonstopmode from the command line.

=============================================================================
7. The error format					*error-file-format*

					*errorformat* *E372* *E373* *E374*
						*E375* *E376* *E377* *E378*
The 'errorformat' option specifies a list of formats that are recognized.  The
first format that matches with an error message is used.  You can add several
formats for different messages your compiler produces, or even entries for
multiple compilers.  See |efm-entries|.

Each entry in 'errorformat' is a scanf-like string that describes the format.
First, you need to know how scanf works.  Look in the documentation of your
C compiler.  Below you find the % items that Vim understands.  Others are
invalid.

Special characters in 'errorformat' are comma and backslash.  See
|efm-entries| for how to deal with them.  Note that a literal "%" is matched
by "%%", thus it is not escaped with a backslash.
Keep in mind that in the `:make` and `:grep` output all NUL characters are
replaced with SOH (0x01).

Note: By default the difference between upper and lowercase is ignored.  If
you want to match case, add "\C" to the pattern |/\C|.


Basic items

	%f		file name (finds a string)
	%l		line number (finds a number)
	%c		column number (finds a number representing character
			column of the error, (1 <tab> == 1 character column))
	%v		virtual column number (finds a number representing
			screen column of the error (1 <tab> == 8 screen
			columns))
	%t		error type (finds a single character)
	%n		error number (finds a number)
	%m		error message (finds a string)
	%r		matches the "rest" of a single-line file message %O/P/Q
	%p		pointer line (finds a sequence of '-', '.', ' ' or
			tabs and uses the length for the column number)
	%*{conv}	any scanf non-assignable conversion
	%%		the single '%' character
	%s		search text (finds a string)

The "%f" conversion may depend on the current 'isfname' setting.  "~/" is
expanded to the home directory and environment variables are expanded.

The "%f" and "%m" conversions have to detect the end of the string.  This
normally happens by matching following characters and items.  When nothing is
following the rest of the line is matched.  If "%f" is followed by a '%' or a
backslash, it will look for a sequence of 'isfname' characters.

On MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2 a leading "C:" will be included in "%f", even
when using "%f:".  This means that a file name which is a single alphabetical
letter will not be detected.

The "%p" conversion is normally followed by a "^".  It's used for compilers
that output a line like: >
	    ^
or >
   ---------^
to indicate the column of the error.  This is to be used in a multi-line error
message.  See |errorformat-javac| for a  useful example.

The "%s" conversion specifies the text to search for to locate the error line.
The text is used as a literal string.  The anchors "^" and "$" are added to
the text to locate the error line exactly matching the search text and the
text is prefixed with the "\V" atom to make it "very nomagic".  The "%s"
conversion can be used to locate lines without a line number in the error
output.  Like the output of the "grep" shell command.
When the pattern is present the line number will not be used.

Changing directory

The following uppercase conversion characters specify the type of special
format strings.  At most one of them may be given as a prefix at the begin
of a single comma-separated format pattern.
Some compilers produce messages that consist of directory names that have to
be prepended to each file name read by %f (example: GNU make).  The following
codes can be used to scan these directory names; they will be stored in an
internal directory stack.					*E379*
	%D		"enter directory" format string; expects a following
			  %f that finds the directory name
	%X		"leave directory" format string; expects following %f

When defining an "enter directory" or "leave directory" format, the "%D" or
"%X" has to be given at the start of that substring.  Vim tracks the directory
changes and prepends the current directory to each erroneous file found with a
relative path.  See |quickfix-directory-stack| for details, tips and
limitations.


Multi-line messages				*errorformat-multi-line*

It is possible to read the output of programs that produce multi-line
messages, i.e. error strings that consume more than one line.  Possible
prefixes are:
	%E		start of a multi-line error message
	%W		start of a multi-line warning message
	%I		start of a multi-line informational message
	%A		start of a multi-line message (unspecified type)
	%>		for next line start with current pattern again |efm-%>|
	%C		continuation of a multi-line message
	%Z		end of a multi-line message
These can be used with '+' and '-', see |efm-ignore| below.

Using "\n" in the pattern won't work to match multi-line messages.

Example: Your compiler happens to write out errors in the following format
(leading line numbers not being part of the actual output):

     1	Error 275 ~
     2	line 42 ~
     3	column 3 ~
     4	' ' expected after '--' ~

The appropriate error format string has to look like this: >
   :set efm=%EError\ %n,%Cline\ %l,%Ccolumn\ %c,%Z%m

And the |:clist| error message generated for this error is:

 1:42 col 3 error 275:  ' ' expected after '--'

Another example: Think of a Python interpreter that produces the following
error message (line numbers are not part of the actual output):

     1	==============================================================
     2	FAIL: testGetTypeIdCachesResult (dbfacadeTest.DjsDBFacadeTest)
     3	--------------------------------------------------------------
     4	Traceback (most recent call last):
     5	  File "unittests/dbfacadeTest.py", line 89, in testFoo
     6	    self.assertEquals(34, dtid)
     7	  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/unittest.py", line 286, in
     8	 failUnlessEqual
     9	    raise self.failureException, \
    10	AssertionError: 34 != 33
    11
    12	--------------------------------------------------------------
    13	Ran 27 tests in 0.063s

Say you want |:clist| write the relevant information of this message only,
namely:
 5 unittests/dbfacadeTest.py:89:  AssertionError: 34 != 33

Then the error format string could be defined as follows: >
  :set efm=%C\ %.%#,%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\,\ line\ %l%.%#,%Z%[%^\ ]%\\@=%m

Note that the %C string is given before the %A here: since the expression
' %.%#' (which stands for the regular expression ' .*') matches every line
starting with a space, followed by any characters to the end of the line,
it also hides line 7 which would trigger a separate error message otherwise.
Error format strings are always parsed pattern by pattern until the first
match occurs.
							*efm-%>*
The %> item can be used to avoid trying patterns that appear earlier in
'errorformat'.  This is useful for patterns that match just about anything.
For example, if the error looks like this:

	Error in line 123 of foo.c: ~
	unknown variable "i" ~

This can be found with: >
	:set efm=xxx,%E%>Error in line %l of %f:,%Z%m
Where "xxx" has a pattern that would also match the second line.

Important: There is no memory of what part of the errorformat matched before;
every line in the error file gets a complete new run through the error format
lines.  For example, if one has: >
  setlocal efm=aa,bb,cc,dd,ee
Where aa, bb, etc. are error format strings.  Each line of the error file will
be matched to the pattern aa, then bb, then cc, etc.  Just because cc matched
the previous error line does _not_ mean that dd will be tried first on the
current line, even if cc and dd are multi-line errorformat strings.



Separate file name			*errorformat-separate-filename*

These prefixes are useful if the file name is given once and multiple messages
follow that refer to this file name.
	%O		single-line file message: overread the matched part
	%P		single-line file message: push file %f onto the stack
	%Q		single-line file message: pop the last file from stack

Example: Given a compiler that produces the following error logfile (without
leading line numbers):

     1	[a1.tt]
     2	(1,17)  error: ';' missing
     3	(21,2)  warning: variable 'z' not defined
     4	(67,3)  error: end of file found before string ended
     5
     6	[a2.tt]
     7
     8	[a3.tt]
     9	NEW compiler v1.1
    10	(2,2)   warning: variable 'x' not defined
    11	(67,3)  warning: 's' already defined

This logfile lists several messages for each file enclosed in [...] which are
properly parsed by an error format like this: >
  :set efm=%+P[%f],(%l\\,%c)%*[\ ]%t%*[^:]:\ %m,%-Q

A call of |:clist| writes them accordingly with their correct filenames:

  2 a1.tt:1 col 17 error: ';' missing
  3 a1.tt:21 col 2 warning: variable 'z' not defined
  4 a1.tt:67 col 3 error: end of file found before string ended
  8 a3.tt:2 col 2 warning: variable 'x' not defined
  9 a3.tt:67 col 3 warning: 's' already defined

Unlike the other prefixes that all match against whole lines, %P, %Q and %O
can be used to match several patterns in the same line.  Thus it is possible
to parse even nested files like in the following line:
  {"file1" {"file2" error1} error2 {"file3" error3 {"file4" error4 error5}}}
The %O then parses over strings that do not contain any push/pop file name
information.  See |errorformat-LaTeX| for an extended example.


Ignoring and using whole messages			*efm-ignore*

The codes '+' or '-' can be combined with the uppercase codes above; in that
case they have to precede the letter, e.g. '%+A' or '%-G':
	%-		do not include the matching multi-line in any output
	%+		include the whole matching line in the %m error string

One prefix is only useful in combination with '+' or '-', namely %G.  It parses
over lines containing general information like compiler version strings or
other headers that can be skipped.
	%-G		ignore this message
	%+G		general message


Pattern matching

The scanf()-like "%*[]" notation is supported for backward-compatibility
with previous versions of Vim.  However, it is also possible to specify
(nearly) any Vim supported regular expression in format strings.
Since meta characters of the regular expression language can be part of
ordinary matching strings or file names (and therefore internally have to
be escaped), meta symbols have to be written with leading '%':
	%\		The single '\' character.  Note that this has to be
			escaped ("%\\") in ":set errorformat=" definitions.
	%.		The single '.' character.
	%#		The single '*'(!) character.
	%^		The single '^' character.  Note that this is not
			useful, the pattern already matches start of line.
	%$		The single '$' character.  Note that this is not
			useful, the pattern already matches end of line.
	%[		The single '[' character for a [] character range.
	%~		The single '~' character.
When using character classes in expressions (see |/\i| for an overview),
terms containing the "\+" quantifier can be written in the scanf() "%*"
notation.  Example: "%\\d%\\+" ("\d\+", "any number") is equivalent to "%*\\d".
Important note: The \(...\) grouping of sub-matches can not be used in format
specifications because it is reserved for internal conversions.


Multiple entries in 'errorformat'			*efm-entries*

To be able to detect output from several compilers, several format patterns
may be put in 'errorformat', separated by commas (note: blanks after the comma
are ignored).  The first pattern that has a complete match is used.  If no
match is found, matching parts from the last one will be used, although the
file name is removed and the error message is set to the whole message.  If
there is a pattern that may match output from several compilers (but not in a
right way), put it after one that is more restrictive.

To include a comma in a pattern precede it with a backslash (you have to type
two in a ":set" command).  To include a backslash itself give two backslashes
(you have to type four in a ":set" command).  You also need to put a backslash
before a space for ":set".


Valid matches						*quickfix-valid*

If a line does not completely match one of the entries in 'errorformat', the
whole line is put in the error message and the entry is marked "not valid"
These lines are skipped with the ":cn" and ":cp" commands (unless there is
no valid line at all).  You can use ":cl!" to display all the error messages.

If the error format does not contain a file name Vim cannot switch to the
correct file.  You will have to do this by hand.


Examples

The format of the file from the Amiga Aztec compiler is:

	filename>linenumber:columnnumber:errortype:errornumber:errormessage

	filename	name of the file in which the error was detected
	linenumber	line number where the error was detected
	columnnumber	column number where the error was detected
	errortype	type of the error, normally a single 'E' or 'W'
	errornumber	number of the error (for lookup in the manual)
	errormessage	description of the error

This can be matched with this 'errorformat' entry:
	%f>%l:%c:%t:%n:%m

Some examples for C compilers that produce single-line error outputs:
%f:%l:\ %t%*[^0123456789]%n:\ %m	for Manx/Aztec C error messages
					(scanf() doesn't understand [0-9])
%f\ %l\ %t%*[^0-9]%n:\ %m		for SAS C
\"%f\"\\,%*[^0-9]%l:\ %m		for generic C compilers
%f:%l:\ %m				for GCC
%f:%l:\ %m,%Dgmake[%*\\d]:\ Entering\ directory\ `%f',
%Dgmake[%*\\d]:\ Leaving\ directory\ `%f'
					for GCC with gmake (concat the lines!)
%f(%l)\ :\ %*[^:]:\ %m			old SCO C compiler (pre-OS5)
%f(%l)\ :\ %t%*[^0-9]%n:\ %m		idem, with error type and number
%f:%l:\ %m,In\ file\ included\ from\ %f:%l:,\^I\^Ifrom\ %f:%l%m
					for GCC, with some extras

Extended examples for the handling of multi-line messages are given below,
see |errorformat-Jikes| and |errorformat-LaTeX|.

Note the backslash in front of a space and double quote.  It is required for
the :set command.  There are two backslashes in front of a comma, one for the
:set command and one to avoid recognizing the comma as a separator of error
formats.


Filtering messages

If you have a compiler that produces error messages that do not fit in the
format string, you could write a program that translates the error messages
into this format.  You can use this program with the ":make" command by
changing the 'makeprg' option.  For example: >
   :set mp=make\ \\\|&\ error_filter
The backslashes before the pipe character are required to avoid it to be
recognized as a command separator.  The backslash before each space is
required for the set command.

=============================================================================
8. The directory stack				*quickfix-directory-stack*

Quickfix maintains a stack for saving all used directories parsed from the
make output.  For GNU-make this is rather simple, as it always prints the
absolute path of all directories it enters and leaves.  Regardless if this is
done via a 'cd' command in the makefile or with the parameter "-C dir" (change
to directory before reading the makefile).  It may be useful to use the switch
"-w" to force GNU-make to print out the working directory before and after
processing.

Maintaining the correct directory is more complicated if you don't use
GNU-make.  AIX-make for example doesn't print any information about its
working directory.  Then you need to enhance the makefile.  In the makefile of
LessTif there is a command which echoes "Making {target} in {dir}".  The
special problem here is that it doesn't print information on leaving the
directory and that it doesn't print the absolute path.

To solve the problem with relative paths and missing "leave directory"
messages Vim uses following algorithm:

1) Check if the given directory is a subdirectory of the current directory.
   If this is true, store it as the current directory.
2) If it is not a subdir of the current directory, try if this is a
   subdirectory of one of the upper directories.
3) If the directory still isn't found, it is assumed to be a subdirectory
   of Vim's current directory.

Additionally it is checked for every file, if it really exists in the
identified directory.  If not, it is searched in all other directories of the
directory stack (NOT the directory subtree!).  If it is still not found, it is
assumed that it is in Vim's current directory.

There are limitations in this algorithm.  These examples assume that make just
prints information about entering a directory in the form "Making all in dir".

1) Assume you have following directories and files:
   ./dir1
   ./dir1/file1.c
   ./file1.c

   If make processes the directory "./dir1" before the current directory and
   there is an error in the file "./file1.c", you will end up with the file
   "./dir1/file.c" loaded by Vim.

   This can only be solved with a "leave directory" message.

2) Assume you have following directories and files:
   ./dir1
   ./dir1/dir2
   ./dir2

   You get the following:

   Make output			  Directory interpreted by Vim
   ------------------------	  ----------------------------
   Making all in dir1		  ./dir1
   Making all in dir2		  ./dir1/dir2
   Making all in dir2		  ./dir1/dir2

   This can be solved by printing absolute directories in the "enter directory"
   message or by printing "leave directory" messages..

To avoid this problem, ensure to print absolute directory names and "leave
directory" messages.

Examples for Makefiles:

Unix:
    libs:
	    for dn in $(LIBDIRS); do				\
		(cd $$dn; echo "Entering dir '$$(pwd)'"; make); \
		echo "Leaving dir";				\
	    done

Add
    %DEntering\ dir\ '%f',%XLeaving\ dir
to your 'errorformat' to handle the above output.

Note that Vim doesn't check if the directory name in a "leave directory"
messages is the current directory.  This is why you could just use the message
"Leaving dir".

=============================================================================
9. Specific error file formats			*errorformats*

						*errorformat-Jikes*
Jikes(TM), a source-to-bytecode Java compiler published by IBM Research,
produces simple multi-line error messages.

An 'errorformat' string matching the produced messages is shown below.
The following lines can be placed in the user's |vimrc| to overwrite Vim's
recognized default formats, or see |:set+=| how to install this format
additionally to the default. >

  :set efm=%A%f:%l:%c:%*\\d:%*\\d:,
	\%C%*\\s%trror:%m,
	\%+C%*[^:]%trror:%m,
	\%C%*\\s%tarning:%m,
	\%C%m
<
Jikes(TM) produces a single-line error message when invoked with the option
"+E", and can be matched with the following: >

  :setl efm=%f:%l:%v:%*\\d:%*\\d:%*\\s%m
<
						*errorformat-javac*
This 'errorformat' has been reported to work well for javac, which outputs a
line with "^" to indicate the column of the error: >
  :setl efm=%A%f:%l:\ %m,%-Z%p^,%-C%.%#
or: >
  :setl efm=%A%f:%l:\ %m,%+Z%p^,%+C%.%#,%-G%.%#
<
Here is an alternative from Michael F. Lamb for Unix that filters the errors
first: >
  :setl errorformat=%Z%f:%l:\ %m,%A%p^,%-G%*[^sl]%.%#
  :setl makeprg=javac\ %:S\ 2>&1\ \\\|\ vim-javac-filter

You need to put the following in "vim-javac-filter" somewhere in your path
(e.g., in ~/bin) and make it executable: >
   #!/bin/sed -f
   /\^$/s/\t/\ /g;/:[0-9]\+:/{h;d};/^[ \t]*\^/G;

In English, that sed script:
- Changes single tabs to single spaces and
- Moves the line with the filename, line number, error message to just after
  the pointer line. That way, the unused error text between doesn't break
  vim's notion of a "multi-line message" and also doesn't force us to include
  it as a "continuation of a multi-line message."

						*errorformat-ant*
For ant (http://jakarta.apache.org/) the above errorformat has to be modified
to honour the leading [javac] in front of each javac output line: >
  :set efm=%A\ %#[javac]\ %f:%l:\ %m,%-Z\ %#[javac]\ %p^,%-C%.%#

The 'errorformat' can also be configured to handle ant together with either
javac or jikes.  If you're using jikes, you should tell ant to use jikes' +E
command line switch which forces jikes to generate one-line error messages.
This is what the second line (of a build.xml file) below does: >
  <property name = "build.compiler"       value = "jikes"/>
  <property name = "build.compiler.emacs" value = "true"/>

The 'errorformat' which handles ant with both javac and jikes is: >
  :set efm=\ %#[javac]\ %#%f:%l:%c:%*\\d:%*\\d:\ %t%[%^:]%#:%m,
	   \%A\ %#[javac]\ %f:%l:\ %m,%-Z\ %#[javac]\ %p^,%-C%.%#
<
						*errorformat-jade*
parsing jade (see http://www.jclark.com/) errors is simple: >
  :set efm=jade:%f:%l:%c:%t:%m
<
						*errorformat-LaTeX*
The following is an example how an 'errorformat' string can be specified
for the (La)TeX typesetting system which displays error messages over
multiple lines.  The output of ":clist" and ":cc" etc. commands displays
multi-lines in a single line, leading white space is removed.
It should be easy to adopt the above LaTeX errorformat to any compiler output
consisting of multi-line errors.

The commands can be placed in a |vimrc| file or some other Vim script file,
e.g. a script containing LaTeX related stuff which is loaded only when editing
LaTeX sources.
Make sure to copy all lines of the example (in the given order), afterwards
remove the comment lines.  For the '\' notation at the start of some lines see
|line-continuation|.

		First prepare 'makeprg' such that LaTeX will report multiple
		errors; do not stop when the first error has occurred: >
 :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
<
		Start of multi-line error messages: >
 :set efm=%E!\ LaTeX\ %trror:\ %m,
	\%E!\ %m,
<		Start of multi-line warning messages; the first two also
		include the line number.  Meaning of some regular expressions:
		  - "%.%#"  (".*")   matches a (possibly empty) string
		  - "%*\\d" ("\d\+") matches a number >
	\%+WLaTeX\ %.%#Warning:\ %.%#line\ %l%.%#,
	\%+W%.%#\ at\ lines\ %l--%*\\d,
	\%WLaTeX\ %.%#Warning:\ %m,
<		Possible continuations of error/warning messages; the first
		one also includes the line number: >
	\%Cl.%l\ %m,
	\%+C\ \ %m.,
	\%+C%.%#-%.%#,
	\%+C%.%#[]%.%#,
	\%+C[]%.%#,
	\%+C%.%#%[{}\\]%.%#,
	\%+C<%.%#>%.%#,
	\%C\ \ %m,
<		Lines that match the following patterns do not contain any
		important information; do not include them in messages: >
	\%-GSee\ the\ LaTeX%m,
	\%-GType\ \ H\ <return>%m,
	\%-G\ ...%.%#,
	\%-G%.%#\ (C)\ %.%#,
	\%-G(see\ the\ transcript%.%#),
<		Generally exclude any empty or whitespace-only line from
		being displayed: >
	\%-G\\s%#,
<		The LaTeX output log does not specify the names of erroneous
		source files per line; rather they are given globally,
		enclosed in parentheses.
		The following patterns try to match these names and store
		them in an internal stack.  The patterns possibly scan over
		the same input line (one after another), the trailing "%r"
		conversion indicates the "rest" of the line that will be
		parsed in the next go until the end of line is reached.

		Overread a file name enclosed in '('...')'; do not push it
		on a stack since the file apparently does not contain any
		error: >
	\%+O(%f)%r,
<		Push a file name onto the stack.  The name is given after '(': >
	\%+P(%f%r,
	\%+P\ %\\=(%f%r,
	\%+P%*[^()](%f%r,
	\%+P[%\\d%[^()]%#(%f%r,
<		Pop the last stored file name when a ')' is scanned: >
	\%+Q)%r,
	\%+Q%*[^()])%r,
	\%+Q[%\\d%*[^()])%r

Note that in some cases file names in the LaTeX output log cannot be parsed
properly.  The parser might have been messed up by unbalanced parentheses
then.  The above example tries to catch the most relevant cases only.
You can customize the given setting to suit your own purposes, for example,
all the annoying "Overfull ..." warnings could be excluded from being
recognized as an error.
Alternatively to filtering the LaTeX compiler output, it is also possible
to directly read the *.log file that is produced by the [La]TeX compiler.
This contains even more useful information about possible error causes.
However, to properly parse such a complex file, an external filter should
be used.  See the description further above how to make such a filter known
by Vim.

						*errorformat-Perl*
In $VIMRUNTIME/tools you can find the efm_perl.pl script, which filters Perl
error messages into a format that quickfix mode will understand.  See the
start of the file about how to use it.  (This script is deprecated, see

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*quotes*
Here are some nice quotes about Vim that I collected from news and mail.


vim (vim) noun - Ebullient vitality and energy.  [Latin, accusative of vis,
strength]  (Dictionary)

Vim is so much better than vi that a great many of my old vi :map's became
immediately obsolete! (Tony Nugent, Australia)

Coming with a very GUI mindset from Windows, I always thought of people using
Vi as some kind of outer space alien in human clothes.  Once I tried I really
got addicted by its power and now I found myself typing Vim keypresses in the
oddest places! That's why I would like to see Vim embedded in every
application which deals with text editing.  (Jos Fonseca)

I was a 12-year emacs user who switched to Vim about a year ago after finally
giving up on the multiple incompatible versions, flaky contributed packages,
disorganized keystrokes, etc.  And it was one of the best moves I ever made.
(Joel Burton)

Although all of the programs were used during the preparation of the new and
revised material, most of the editing was done with Vim versions 4.5 and 5.0
under GNU-Linux (Redhat 4.2).  (Arnold Robbins, Israel, author of "Learning
the Vi editor")

Out of all the open software i've ever seen and used, and i've seen a lot, Vim
is the best, most useful and highest quality to work with, second only to the
linux kernel itself.  (Peter Jay Salzman)

It's well worth noting that the _entirety_ of SourceForge was written using
Vim and its nifty PHP syntax highlighting.  I think the entire SF.net tech
staff uses Vim and we're all excited to have you aboard! (Tim Perdue)

Vim is one of a select bunch of tools for which I have no substitute.  It is
a brilliant piece of work! (Biju Chacko)

A previous girlfriend of mine switched to emacs.  Needless to say, the
relationship went nowhere.  (Geoffrey Mann)

I rarely think about Vim, in the same way that I guess a fish rarely thinks
about water.  It's the environment in which everything else happens.  I'm a
fairly busy system administrator working on a lot of different platforms.  Vim
is the only thing that's consistent across all my systems, and it's just about
the only thing that doesn't break from time to time.  When a new system comes
in the door without Vim, I install it right away.  Great to have a tool that's
the same everywhere, that's completely reliable, so I can ignore it and think
about other things.  (Pete Schaeffer)

Having recently succeeded in running Vim via telnet through a Nokia
Communicator, I can now report that it works nicely on a Palm Pilot too.
(Allan Kelly, Scotland)

You've done a tremendous job with 'VIM', Bram!  The more I use it, the more
impressed I get (I am an old 'vi' die hard who once started out with early
versions of 'emacs' in the late 1970's and was relieved by finding 'vi' in the
first UNIX I came across in 1983).  In my opinion, it's about time 'VIM'
replace 'emacs' as the standard for top editors.  (Bo Thide', Sweden)

I love and use VIM heavily too.  (Larry Wall)

Vi is like a Ferrari, if you're a beginner, it handles like a bitch, but once
you get the hang of it, it's small, powerful and FAST! (Unknown)
VIM is like a new model Ferrari, and sounds like one too - "VIIIIIIMMM!"
(Stephen Riehm, Germany)

Schon bei Nutzung eines Bruchteils der VIM-Funktionen wird der Benutzer recht
schnell die Vorzuege dieses Editors kennen- und schaetzenlernen.
Translated: Even when only using a fraction of VIM-functions, the user will
quickly get used to and appreciate the advantages of this editor.  (Garry
Glendown, conclusion of an article on VIM in iX magazine 9/1998)

I've recently acquired the O'Reilly book on VI (it also discusses VIM
in-depth), and I'm amazed at just how powerful this application is.  (Jeffrey
Rankin)

This guide was written using the Windows 9.x distribution of GVIM, which is
quite possibly the greatest thing to come along since God created the naked
girl.  (Michael DiBernardo)

Boy, I thought I knew almost everything about VIM, but every time I browse the
online documentation, I hit upon a minor but cool aspect of a VIM feature that
I didn't know before!  I must say the documentation is one the finest I've
ever seen in a product -- even better than most commercial products.
(Gautam Mudunuri)

VIM 4.5 is really a fantastic editor.  It has sooooo many features and more
importantly, the defaults are so well thought out that you really don't have
to change anything!!  Words cannot express my amazement and gratitude to the
creators of VIM.  Keep it up.  (Vikas, USA)

I wonder how long it will be before people will refer to other Vi editors as
VIM clones?  (Darren Hiebert)

I read about [auto-positioning-in-file-based-on-the-errors-from-make] in one
of those "Perfect Programmer's Editor" threads and was delighted to discover
that VIM already supports it.  (Brendan Macmillan, Australia)

I just discovered VIM (5.0) and I'm telling everyone I know about it!
I tell them VIM stands for VI for the new (M)illenium.  Thanks so much!
(Matt F. Valentine)

I think from now on "vi" should be called "Vim Imitation", not the other way
around.  (Rungun Ramanathan)

The Law of VIM:
For each member b of the possible behaviour space B of program P, there exists
a finite time t before which at least one user u in the total user space U of
program P will request b becomes a member of the allowed behaviour space B'
(B' <= B).
In other words: Sooner or later everyone wants everything as an option.
(Negri)

Whenever I move to a new computing platform, the first thing I do is to port
VIM.  Lately, I am simply stunned by its ease of compilation using the
configure facility.  (A.M. Sabuncu, Turkey)

The options are really excellent and very powerful.  (Anish Maharaj)

The Spring user-interface designs are in, and word from the boutiques is that
80x24 text-only mode is back with a *vengeance! Vi editor clone VIM burst onto
March desk-tops with a dazzling show of pastel syntax highlights for its 5.0
look.  Strident and customizable, VIM raises eyebrows with its interpretation
of the classic Vi single-key macro collection.
http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive98/now0327.txt&line=179#l

I just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know that VIM 5 ROCKS!
Syntax highlighting: how did I survive without it?!  Thank you for creating
mankind's best editor!  (Mun Johl, USA)

Thanks again for VIM.  I use it every day on Linux.  (Eric Foster-Johnson,
author of the book "UNIX Programming Tools")

The BEST EDITOR EVER (Stuart Woolford)

I have used most of VIM's fancy features at least once, many frequently, and I
can honestly say that I couldn't live with anything less anymore.  My
productivity has easily doubled compared to what it was when I used vi.
(Sitaram Chamarty)

I luv VIM.  It is incredible.  I'm naming my first-born Vimberly.  (Jose
Unpingco, USA)

Hint:  "VIM" is "vi improved" - much better! (Sven Guckes, Germany)

I use VIM every day.  I spend more time in VIM than in any other program...
It's the best vi clone there is.  I think it's great.  (Craig Sanders,
Australia)

I strongly advise using VIM--its infinite undo/redo saved me much grief.
(Terry Brown)

Thanks very much for writing what in my opinion is the finest text editor on
the planet.  If I were to get another cat, I would name it "Vim".
(Bob Sheehan, USA)

I typed :set all and the screen FILLED up with options.  A whole screen of
things to be set and unset.  I saw some of my old friends like wrapmargin,
modelines and showmode, but the screen was FILLED with new friends!   I love
them all!   I love VIM!   I'm so happy that I've found this editor!  I feel
like how I once felt when I started using vi after a couple of years of using
ed.  I never thought I'd forsake my beloved ed, but vi ... oh god, vi was
great.  And now, VIM.  (Peter Jay Salzman, USA)

I am really happy with such a wonderful software package.  Much better than
almost any expensive, off the shelf program.  (Jeff Walker)

Whenever I reread the VIM documentation I'm overcome with excitement at the
power of the editor.  (William Edward Webber, Australia)

Hurrah for VIM!! It is "at your fingertips" like vi, and has the extensions
that vi sorely needs: highlighting for executing commands on blocks, an easily
navigable and digestible help screen, and more.  (Paul Pax)

The reason WHY I don't have this amazingly useful macro any more, is that I
now use VIM - and this is built in!! (Stephen Riehm, Germany)

I am a user of VIM and I love it.  I use it to do all my programming, C,
C++, HTML what ever.  (Tim Allwine)

I discovered VIM after years of struggling with the original vi, and I just
can't live without it any more.  (Emmanuel Mogenet, USA)

Emacs has not a bit of chance to survive so long as VIM is around.  Besides,
it also has the most detailed software documentation I have ever seen---much
better than most commercial software!  (Leiming Qian)

This version of VIM will just blow people apart when they discover just how
fantastic it is! (Tony Nugent, Australia)

I took your advice & finally got VIM & I'm really impressed.  Instant convert.
(Patrick Killelea, USA)

VIM is by far my favorite piece of shareware and I have been particularly
pleased with version 3.0.  This is really a solid piece of work.  (Robert
Colon, USA)

VIM is a joy to use, it is so well thought and practical that I wonder why
anybody would use visual development tools.  VIM is powerful and elegant, it
looks deceptively simple but is almost as complex as a 747 (especially when I
look at my growing .vimrc), keep up that wonderful job, VIM is a centerpiece
of the free software world.  (Louis-David Mitterand, USA)

I cannot believe how great it is to use VIM.  I think the guys at work are
getting tired of hearing me bragging about it.  Others eyes are lighting up.
(Rick Croote)

Emacs takes way too much time to start up and run, it is too big and bulky for
effective use and the interface is more confusing than it is of any help.  VIM
however is short, it is fast, it is powerful, it has a good interface and it
is all purpose.  (Paal Ditlefsen Ekran)

From the first time I got VIM3.0, I was very enthusiastic.  It has almost no
problems.  The swapfile handling and the backup possibilities are robust, also
the protection against editing one file twice.  It is very compatible to the
real VI (and that is a MUST, because my brain is trained over years in using
it).  (Gert van Antwerpen, Holland)

Visual mode in VIM is a very powerful thing! (Tony Nugent, Australia)

I have to say that VIM is =THE= single greatest piece of source code to ever
come across the net (Jim Battle, USA).

In fact, if you do want to get a new vi I'd suggest VIM-3.0.  This is, by
far, the best version of vi I've ever seen (Albert W. Schueller).

I should mention that VIM is a very good editor and can compete with anything
(Ilya Beloozerov).

To tell the truth sometimes I used elvis, vile, xvi, calvin, etc.  And this is
the reason that I can state that VIM is the best! (Ferenc Deak, Hungary)

VIM is by far the best editor that I have used in a long time, and I have
looked at just about every thing that is available for every platform that I
use.  VIM is the best on all of them.  (Guy L. Oliver)

VIM is the greatest editor since the stone chisel.  (Jose Unpingco, USA)

I would like to say that with VIM I am finally making the 'emacs to vi'
transition - as an Editor it is so much better in many ways: keyboard layout,
memory usage, text alteration to name 3.  (Mark Adam)

In fact, now if I want to know what a particular setting does in vi, I fire up
VIM and check out its help!  (Nikhil Patel, USA)

As a vi user, VIM has made working with text a far more pleasant task than
before I encountered this program.  (Steinar Knutsen, Norway)

I use VIM since version 3.0.  Since that time, it is the ONLY editor I use,
with Solaris, Linux and OS/2 Warp.  I suggest all my friends to use VIM, they
try, and they continue using it.  VIM is really the best software I have ever
downloaded from the Internet, and the best editor I know of.  (Marco
Eccettuato, Italy)

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Recovery after a crash					*crash-recovery*

You have spent several hours typing in that text that has to be finished
next morning, and then disaster strikes: Your computer crashes.

			DON'T PANIC!

You can recover most of your changes from the files that Vim uses to store
the contents of the file.  Mostly you can recover your work with one command:
	vim -r filename

1. The swap file	|swap-file|
2. Recovery		|recovery|

==============================================================================
1. The swap file					*swap-file*

Vim stores the things you changed in a swap file.  Using the original file
you started from plus the swap file you can mostly recover your work.

You can see the name of the current swap file being used with the command:

	:sw[apname]					*:sw* *:swapname*

The name of the swap file is normally the same as the file you are editing,
with the extension ".swp".
- On Unix, a '.' is prepended to swap file names in the same directory as the
  edited file.  This avoids that the swap file shows up in a directory
  listing.
- On MS-DOS machines and when the 'shortname' option is on, any '.' in the
  original file name is replaced with '_'.
- If this file already exists (e.g., when you are recovering from a crash) a
  warning is given and another extension is used, ".swo", ".swn", etc.
- An existing file will never be overwritten.
- The swap file is deleted as soon as Vim stops editing the file.

Technical: The replacement of '.' with '_' is done to avoid problems with
	   MS-DOS compatible filesystems (e.g., crossdos, multidos).  If Vim
	   is able to detect that the file is on an MS-DOS-like filesystem, a
	   flag is set that has the same effect as the 'shortname' option.
	   This flag is reset when you start editing another file.
							*E326*
	   If the ".swp" file name already exists, the last character is
	   decremented until there is no file with that name or ".saa" is
	   reached.  In the last case, no swap file is created.

By setting the 'directory' option you can place the swap file in another place
than where the edited file is.
Advantages:
- You will not pollute the directories with ".swp" files.
- When the 'directory' is on another partition, reduce the risk of damaging
  the file system where the file is (in a crash).
Disadvantages:
- You can get name collisions from files with the same name but in different
  directories (although Vim tries to avoid that by comparing the path name).
  This will result in bogus ATTENTION warning messages.
- When you use your home directory, and somebody else tries to edit the same
  file, he will not see your swap file and will not get the ATTENTION warning
  message.
On the Amiga you can also use a recoverable ram disk, but there is no 100%
guarantee that this works.  Putting swap files in a normal ram disk (like RAM:
on the Amiga) or in a place that is cleared when rebooting (like /tmp on Unix)
makes no sense, you will lose the swap file in a crash.

If you want to put swap files in a fixed place, put a command resembling the
following ones in your .vimrc:
	:set dir=dh2:tmp	(for Amiga)
	:set dir=~/tmp		(for Unix)
	:set dir=c:\\tmp	(for MS-DOS and Win32)
This is also very handy when editing files on floppy.  Of course you will have
to create that "tmp" directory for this to work!

For read-only files, a swap file is not used.  Unless the file is big, causing
the amount of memory used to be higher than given with 'maxmem' or
'maxmemtot'.  And when making a change to a read-only file, the swap file is
created anyway.

The 'swapfile' option can be reset to avoid creating a swapfile.  And the
|:noswapfile| modifier can be used to not create a swapfile for a new buffer.

:nos[wapfile]   {command}			*:nos* *:noswapfile*
		Execute {command}. If it contains a command that loads a new
		buffer, it will be loaded without creating a swapfile and the
		'swapfile' option will be reset.  If a buffer already had a
		swapfile it is not removed and 'swapfile' is not reset.


Detecting an existing swap file ~

You can find this in the user manual, section |11.3|.


Updating the swapfile ~

The swap file is updated after typing 200 characters or when you have not
typed anything for four seconds.  This only happens if the buffer was
changed, not when you only moved around.  The reason why it is not kept up to
date all the time is that this would slow down normal work too much.  You can
change the 200 character count with the 'updatecount' option.  You can set
the time with the 'updatetime' option.  The time is given in milliseconds.
After writing to the swap file Vim syncs the file to disk.  This takes some
time, especially on busy Unix systems.  If you don't want this you can set the
'swapsync' option to an empty string.  The risk of losing work becomes bigger
though.  On some non-Unix systems (MS-DOS, Amiga) the swap file won't be
written at all.

If the writing to the swap file is not wanted, it can be switched off by
setting the 'updatecount' option to 0.  The same is done when starting Vim
with the "-n" option.  Writing can be switched back on by setting the
'updatecount' option to non-zero.  Swap files will be created for all buffers
when doing this.  But when setting 'updatecount' to zero, the existing swap
files will not be removed, it will only affect files that will be opened
after this.

If you want to make sure that your changes are in the swap file use this
command:

					*:pre* *:preserve* *E313* *E314*
:pre[serve]		Write all text for all buffers into swap file.  The
			original file is no longer needed for recovery.
			This sets a flag in the current buffer.  When the '&'
			flag is present in 'cpoptions' the swap file will not
			be deleted for this buffer when Vim exits and the
			buffer is still loaded |cpo-&|.
			{Vi: might also exit}

A Vim swap file can be recognized by the first six characters: "b0VIM ".
After that comes the version number, e.g., "3.0".


Links and symbolic links ~

On Unix it is possible to have two names for the same file.  This can be done
with hard links and with symbolic links (symlinks).

For hard links Vim does not know the other name of the file.  Therefore, the
name of the swapfile will be based on the name you used to edit the file.
There is no check for editing the same file by the other name too, because Vim
cannot find the other swapfile (except for searching all of your harddisk,
which would be very slow).

For symbolic links Vim resolves the links to find the name of the actual file.
The swap file name is based on that name.  Thus it doesn't matter by what name
you edit the file, the swap file name will normally be the same.  However,
there are exceptions:
- When the directory of the actual file is not writable the swapfile is put
  elsewhere.
- When the symbolic links somehow create a loop you get an *E773* error
  message and the unmodified file name will be used.  You won't be able to
  save your file normally.

==============================================================================
2. Recovery					*recovery* *E308* *E311*

Basic file recovery is explained in the user manual: |usr_11.txt|.

Another way to do recovery is to start Vim and use the ":recover" command.
This is easy when you start Vim to edit a file and you get the "ATTENTION:
Found a swap file ..." message.  In this case the single command ":recover"
will do the work.  You can also give the name of the file or the swap file to
the recover command:
					*:rec* *:recover* *E305* *E306* *E307*
:rec[over] [file]	Try to recover [file] from the swap file.  If [file]
			is not given use the file name for the current
			buffer.  The current contents of the buffer are lost.
			This command fails if the buffer was modified.

:rec[over]! [file]	Like ":recover", but any changes in the current
			buffer are lost.

							*E312* *E309* *E310*
Vim has some intelligence about what to do if the swap file is corrupt in
some way.  If Vim has doubt about what it found, it will give an error
message and insert lines with "???" in the text.  If you see an error message
while recovering, search in the file for "???" to see what is wrong.  You may
want to cut and paste to get the text you need.

The most common remark is "???LINES MISSING".  This means that Vim cannot read
the text from the original file.  This can happen if the system crashed and
parts of the original file were not written to disk.

Be sure that the recovery was successful before overwriting the original
file or deleting the swap file.  It is good practice to write the recovered
file elsewhere and run 'diff' to find out if the changes you want are in the
recovered file.  Or use |:DiffOrig|.

Once you are sure the recovery is ok delete the swap file.  Otherwise, you
will continue to get warning messages that the ".swp" file already exists.

{Vi: recovers in another way and sends mail if there is something to recover}


ENCRYPTION AND THE SWAP FILE				*:recover-crypt*

When the text file is encrypted the swap file is encrypted as well.  This
makes recovery a bit more complicated.  When recovering from a swap file and
encryption has been used, you will be asked to enter one or two crypt keys.

If the text file does not exist you will only be asked to enter the crypt key
for the swap file.

If the text file does exist, it may be encrypted in a different way than the
swap file.  You will be asked for the crypt key twice:

	Need encryption key for "/tmp/tt" ~
	Enter encryption key: ****** ~
	"/tmp/tt" [crypted] 23200L, 522129C ~
	Using swap file "/tmp/.tt.swp" ~
	Original file "/tmp/tt" ~
	Swap file is encrypted: "/tmp/.tt.swp" ~
	If you entered a new crypt key but did not write the text file, ~
	enter the new crypt key. ~
	If you wrote the text file after changing the crypt key press enter ~
	to use the same key for text file and swap file ~
	Enter encryption key:  ~

You can be in one of these two situations:

1. The encryption key was not changed, or after changing the key the text file
   was written.  You will be prompted for the crypt key twice.  The second
   time you can simply press Enter.  That means the same key is used for the
   text file and the swap file.
2. You entered a new encryption key, but did not save the text file.  Vim will
   then use the new key for the swap file, and the text file will still be
   encrypted with the old key.  At the second prompt enter the new key.

Note that after recovery the key of the swap file will be used for the text
file.  Thus if you write the text file, you need to use that new key.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Vim client-server communication				*client-server*

1. Common functionality		|clientserver|
2. X11 specific items		|x11-clientserver|
3. MS-Windows specific items	|w32-clientserver|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Common functionality					*clientserver*

When compiled with the |+clientserver| option, Vim can act as a command
server.  It accepts messages from a client and executes them.  At the same
time, Vim can function as a client and send commands to a Vim server.

The following command line arguments are available:

    argument			meaning	~

   --remote [+{cmd}] {file} ...					*--remote*
				Open the file list in a remote Vim.  When
				there is no Vim server, execute locally.
				There is one optional init command: +{cmd}.
				This must be an Ex command that can be
				followed by "|".
				The rest of the command line is taken as the
				file list.  Thus any non-file arguments must
				come before this.
				You cannot edit stdin this way |--|.
				The remote Vim is raised.  If you don't want
				this use >
				 vim --remote-send "<C-\><C-N>:n filename<CR>"
<  --remote-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...			*--remote-silent*
				As above, but don't complain if there is no
				server and the file is edited locally.
   --remote-wait [+{cmd}] {file} ...				*--remote-wait*
				As --remote, but wait for files to complete
				(unload) in remote Vim.
   --remote-wait-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...		*--remote-wait-silent*
				As --remote-wait, but don't complain if there
				is no server.
							*--remote-tab*
   --remote-tab			Like --remote but open each file in a new
				tabpage.
							*--remote-tab-silent*
   --remote-tab-silent		Like --remote-silent but open each file in a
				new tabpage.
							*--remote-tab-wait*
   --remote-tab-wait		Like --remote-wait but open each file in a new
				tabpage.

						*--remote-tab-wait-silent*
   --remote-tab-wait-silent	Like --remote-wait-silent but open each file
				in a new tabpage.
								*--servername*
   --servername {name}		Become the server {name}.  When used together
				with one of the --remote commands: connect to
				server {name} instead of the default (see
				below).
								*--remote-send*
   --remote-send {keys}		Send {keys} to server and exit.  The {keys}
   				are not mapped.  Special key names are
				recognized, e.g., "<CR>" results in a CR
				character.
								*--remote-expr*
   --remote-expr {expr}		Evaluate {expr} in server and print the result
				on stdout.
								*--serverlist*
   --serverlist			Output a list of server names.


Examples ~

Edit "file.txt" in an already running GVIM server: >
    gvim --remote file.txt

Edit "file.txt" in an already running server called FOOBAR: >
    gvim --servername FOOBAR --remote file.txt

Edit "file.txt" in server "FILES" if it exists, become server "FILES"
otherwise: >
    gvim --servername FILES --remote-silent file.txt

This doesn't work, all arguments after --remote will be used as file names: >
    gvim --remote --servername FOOBAR file.txt

Edit file "+foo" in a remote server (note the use of "./" to avoid the special
meaning of the leading plus): >
    vim --remote ./+foo

Tell the remote server "BLA" to write all files and exit: >
    vim --servername BLA --remote-send '<C-\><C-N>:wqa<CR>'


SERVER NAME

By default Vim will try to register the name under which it was invoked (gvim,
egvim ...).  This can be overridden with the --servername argument.  If the
specified name is not available, a postfix is applied until a free name is
encountered, i.e. "gvim1" for the second invocation of gvim on a particular
X-server.  The resulting name is available in the servername builtin variable
|v:servername|.  The case of the server name is ignored, thus "gvim" and
"GVIM" are considered equal.

When Vim is invoked with --remote, --remote-wait or --remote-send it will try
to locate the server name determined by the invocation name and --servername
argument as described above.  If an exact match is not available, the first
server with the number postfix will be used.  If a name with the number
postfix is specified with the --servername argument, it must match exactly.

If no server can be located and --remote or --remote-wait was used, Vim will
start up according to the rest of the command line and do the editing by
itself.  This way it is not necessary to know whether gvim is already started
when sending command to it.

The --serverlist argument will cause Vim to print a list of registered command
servers on the standard output (stdout) and exit.

Win32 Note: Making the Vim server go to the foreground doesn't always work,
because MS-Windows doesn't allow it.  The client will move the server to the
foreground when using the --remote or --remote-wait argument and the server
name starts with "g".


REMOTE EDITING

The --remote argument will cause a |:drop| command to be constructed from the
rest of the command line and sent as described above.
The --remote-wait argument does the same thing and additionally sets up to
wait for each of the files to have been edited.  This uses the BufUnload
event, thus as soon as a file has been unloaded, Vim assumes you are done
editing it.
Note that the --remote and --remote-wait arguments will consume the rest of
the command line.  I.e. all remaining arguments will be regarded as filenames.
You can not put options there!


FUNCTIONS
								*E240* *E573*
There are a number of Vim functions for scripting the command server.  See
the description in |eval.txt| or use CTRL-] on the function name to jump to
the full explanation.

    synopsis				     explanation ~
    remote_expr( server, string, idvar)      send expression
    remote_send( server, string, idvar)      send key sequence
    serverlist()			     get a list of available servers
    remote_peek( serverid, retvar)	     check for reply string
    remote_read( serverid)		     read reply string
    server2client( serverid, string)	     send reply string
    remote_foreground( server)		     bring server to the front

See also the explanation of |CTRL-\_CTRL-N|.  Very useful as a leading key
sequence.
The {serverid} for server2client() can be obtained with expand("<client>")

==============================================================================
2. X11 specific items					*x11-clientserver*
				    *E247* *E248* *E251* *E258* *E277*

The communication between client and server goes through the X server.  The
display of the Vim server must be specified.  The usual protection of the X
server is used, you must be able to open a window on the X server for the
communication to work.  It is possible to communicate between different
systems.

By default, a GUI Vim will register a name on the X-server by which it can be
addressed for subsequent execution of injected strings.  Vim can also act as
a client and send strings to other instances of Vim on the same X11 display.

When an X11 GUI Vim (gvim) is started, it will try to register a send-server
name on the 'VimRegistry' property on the root window.

A non GUI Vim with access to the X11 display (|xterm-clipboard| enabled), can
also act as a command server if a server name is explicitly given with the
--servername argument.

An empty --servername argument will cause the command server to be disabled.

To send commands to a Vim server from another application, read the source
file src/if_xcmdsrv.c, it contains some hints about the protocol used.

==============================================================================
3. Win32 specific items					*w32-clientserver*

Every Win32 Vim can work as a server, also in the console.  You do not need a
version compiled with OLE.  Windows messages are used, this works on any
version of MS-Windows.  But only communication within one system is possible.

Since MS-Windows messages are used, any other application should be able to
communicate with a Vim server.  An alternative is using the OLE functionality
|ole-interface|.

When using gvim, the --remote-wait only works properly this way: >

	start /w gvim --remote-wait file.txt

Repeating commands, Vim scripts and debugging			*repeating*

Chapter 26 of the user manual introduces repeating |usr_26.txt|.

1. Single repeats	|single-repeat|
2. Multiple repeats	|multi-repeat|
3. Complex repeats	|complex-repeat|
4. Using Vim scripts	|using-scripts|
5. Debugging scripts	|debug-scripts|
6. Profiling		|profiling|

==============================================================================
1. Single repeats					*single-repeat*

							*.*
.			Repeat last change, with count replaced with [count].
			Also repeat a yank command, when the 'y' flag is
			included in 'cpoptions'.  Does not repeat a
			command-line command.

Simple changes can be repeated with the "." command.  Without a count, the
count of the last change is used.  If you enter a count, it will replace the
last one.  |v:count| and |v:count1| will be set.

If the last change included a specification of a numbered register, the
register number will be incremented.  See |redo-register| for an example how
to use this.

Note that when repeating a command that used a Visual selection, the same SIZE
of area is used, see |visual-repeat|.

							*@:*
@:			Repeat last command-line [count] times.
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_hist| feature}


==============================================================================
2. Multiple repeats					*multi-repeat*

						*:g* *:global* *E147* *E148*
:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]
			Execute the Ex command [cmd] (default ":p") on the
			lines within [range] where {pattern} matches.

:[range]g[lobal]!/{pattern}/[cmd]
			Execute the Ex command [cmd] (default ":p") on the
			lines within [range] where {pattern} does NOT match.

							*:v* *:vglobal*
:[range]v[global]/{pattern}/[cmd]
			Same as :g!.

Instead of the '/' which surrounds the {pattern}, you can use any other
single byte character, but not an alphabetic character, '\', '"' or '|'.
This is useful if you want to include a '/' in the search pattern or
replacement string.

For the definition of a pattern, see |pattern|.

The global commands work by first scanning through the [range] lines and
marking each line where a match occurs (for a multi-line pattern, only the
start of the match matters).
In a second scan the [cmd] is executed for each marked line with its line
number prepended.  For ":v" and ":g!" the command is executed for each not
marked line.  If a line is deleted its mark disappears.
The default for [range] is the whole buffer (1,$).  Use "CTRL-C" to interrupt
the command.  If an error message is given for a line, the command for that
line is aborted and the global command continues with the next marked or
unmarked line.

To repeat a non-Ex command, you can use the ":normal" command: >
	:g/pat/normal {commands}
Make sure that {commands} ends with a whole command, otherwise Vim will wait
for you to type the rest of the command for each match.  The screen will not
have been updated, so you don't know what you are doing.  See |:normal|.

The undo/redo command will undo/redo the whole global command at once.
The previous context mark will only be set once (with "''" you go back to
where the cursor was before the global command).

The global command sets both the last used search pattern and the last used
substitute pattern (this is vi compatible).  This makes it easy to globally
replace a string:
	:g/pat/s//PAT/g
This replaces all occurrences of "pat" with "PAT".  The same can be done with:
	:%s/pat/PAT/g
Which is two characters shorter!

When using "global" in Ex mode, a special case is using ":visual" as a
command.  This will move to a matching line, go to Normal mode to let you
execute commands there until you use |Q| to return to Ex mode.  This will be
repeated for each matching line.  While doing this you cannot use ":global".
To abort this type CTRL-C twice.

==============================================================================
3. Complex repeats					*complex-repeat*

							*q* *recording*
q{0-9a-zA-Z"}		Record typed characters into register {0-9a-zA-Z"}
			(uppercase to append).  The 'q' command is disabled
			while executing a register, and it doesn't work inside
			a mapping and |:normal|.  {Vi: no recording}

q			Stops recording.  (Implementation note: The 'q' that
			stops recording is not stored in the register, unless
			it was the result of a mapping)  {Vi: no recording}

							*@*
@{0-9a-z".=*+}		Execute the contents of register {0-9a-z".=*+} [count]
			times.  Note that register '%' (name of the current
			file) and '#' (name of the alternate file) cannot be
			used.
			The register is executed like a mapping, that means
			that the difference between 'wildchar' and 'wildcharm'
			applies.
			For "@=" you are prompted to enter an expression.  The
			result of the expression is then executed.
			See also |@:|.  {Vi: only named registers}

							*@@* *E748*
@@			Repeat the previous @{0-9a-z":*} [count] times.

:[addr]*{0-9a-z".=+}						*:@* *:star*
:[addr]@{0-9a-z".=*+}	Execute the contents of register {0-9a-z".=*+} as an Ex
			command.  First set cursor at line [addr] (default is
			current line).  When the last line in the register does
			not have a <CR> it will be added automatically when
			the 'e' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.
			Note that the ":*" command is only recognized when the
			'*' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.  This is NOT the
			default when 'nocompatible' is used.
			For ":@=" the last used expression is used.  The
			result of evaluating the expression is executed as an
			Ex command.
			Mappings are not recognized in these commands.
			{Vi: only in some versions} Future: Will execute the
			register for each line in the address range.

							*:@:*
:[addr]@:		Repeat last command-line.  First set cursor at line
			[addr] (default is current line).  {not in Vi}

							*:@@*
:[addr]@@		Repeat the previous :@{0-9a-z"}.  First set cursor at
			line [addr] (default is current line).  {Vi: only in
			some versions}

==============================================================================
4. Using Vim scripts					*using-scripts*

For writing a Vim script, see chapter 41 of the user manual |usr_41.txt|.

					*:so* *:source* *load-vim-script*
:so[urce] {file}	Read Ex commands from {file}.  These are commands that
			start with a ":".
			Triggers the |SourcePre| autocommand.

:so[urce]! {file}	Read Vim commands from {file}.  These are commands
			that are executed from Normal mode, like you type
			them.
			When used after |:global|, |:argdo|, |:windo|,
			|:bufdo|, in a loop or when another command follows
			the display won't be updated while executing the
			commands.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ru* *:runtime*
:ru[ntime][!] {file} ..
			Read Ex commands from {file} in each directory given
			by 'runtimepath'.  There is no error for non-existing
			files.  Example: >
				:runtime syntax/c.vim

<			There can be multiple {file} arguments, separated by
			spaces.  Each {file} is searched for in the first
			directory from 'runtimepath', then in the second
			directory, etc.  Use a backslash to include a space
			inside {file} (although it's better not to use spaces
			in file names, it causes trouble).

			When [!] is included, all found files are sourced.
			When it is not included only the first found file is
			sourced.

			When {file} contains wildcards it is expanded to all
			matching files.  Example: >
				:runtime! plugin/*.vim
<			This is what Vim uses to load the plugin files when
			starting up.  This similar command: >
				:runtime plugin/*.vim
<			would source the first file only.

			When 'verbose' is one or higher, there is a message
			when no file could be found.
			When 'verbose' is two or higher, there is a message
			about each searched file.
			{not in Vi}

:scripte[ncoding] [encoding]		*:scripte* *:scriptencoding* *E167*
			Specify the character encoding used in the script.
			The following lines will be converted from [encoding]
			to the value of the 'encoding' option, if they are
			different.  Examples: >
				scriptencoding iso-8859-5
				scriptencoding cp932
<
			When [encoding] is empty, no conversion is done.  This
			can be used to restrict conversion to a sequence of
			lines: >
				scriptencoding euc-jp
				... lines to be converted ...
				scriptencoding
				... not converted ...

<			When conversion isn't supported by the system, there
			is no error message and no conversion is done.

			Don't use "ucs-2" or "ucs-4", scripts cannot be in
			these encodings (they would contain NUL bytes).
			When a sourced script starts with a BOM (Byte Order
			Mark) in utf-8 format Vim will recognize it, no need
			to use ":scriptencoding utf-8" then.

			When compiled without the |+multi_byte| feature this
			command is ignored.
			{not in Vi}

						*:scrip* *:scriptnames*
:scrip[tnames]		List all sourced script names, in the order they were
			first sourced.  The number is used for the script ID
			|<SID>|.
			{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the
			|+eval| feature}

						*:fini* *:finish* *E168*
:fini[sh]		Stop sourcing a script.  Can only be used in a Vim
			script file.  This is a quick way to skip the rest of
			the file.  If it is used after a |:try| but before the
			matching |:finally| (if present), the commands
			following the ":finally" up to the matching |:endtry|
			are executed first.  This process applies to all
			nested ":try"s in the script.  The outermost ":endtry"
			then stops sourcing the script.  {not in Vi}

All commands and command sequences can be repeated by putting them in a named
register and then executing it.  There are two ways to get the commands in the
register:
- Use the record command "q".  You type the commands once, and while they are
  being executed they are stored in a register.  Easy, because you can see
  what you are doing.  If you make a mistake, "p"ut the register into the
  file, edit the command sequence, and then delete it into the register
  again.  You can continue recording by appending to the register (use an
  uppercase letter).
- Delete or yank the command sequence into the register.

Often used command sequences can be put under a function key with the ':map'
command.

An alternative is to put the commands in a file, and execute them with the
':source!' command.  Useful for long command sequences.  Can be combined with
the ':map' command to put complicated commands under a function key.

The ':source' command reads Ex commands from a file line by line.  You will
have to type any needed keyboard input.  The ':source!' command reads from a
script file character by character, interpreting each character as if you
typed it.

Example: When you give the ":!ls" command you get the |hit-enter| prompt.  If
you ':source' a file with the line "!ls" in it, you will have to type the
<Enter> yourself.  But if you ':source!' a file with the line ":!ls" in it,
the next characters from that file are read until a <CR> is found.  You will
not have to type <CR> yourself, unless ":!ls" was the last line in the file.

It is possible to put ':source[!]' commands in the script file, so you can
make a top-down hierarchy of script files.  The ':source' command can be
nested as deep as the number of files that can be opened at one time (about
15).  The ':source!' command can be nested up to 15 levels deep.

You can use the "<sfile>" string (literally, this is not a special key) inside
of the sourced file, in places where a file name is expected.  It will be
replaced by the file name of the sourced file.  For example, if you have a
"other.vimrc" file in the same directory as your ".vimrc" file, you can source
it from your ".vimrc" file with this command: >
	:source <sfile>:h/other.vimrc

In script files terminal-dependent key codes are represented by
terminal-independent two character codes.  This means that they can be used
in the same way on different kinds of terminals.  The first character of a
key code is 0x80 or 128, shown on the screen as "~@".  The second one can be
found in the list |key-notation|.  Any of these codes can also be entered
with CTRL-V followed by the three digit decimal code.  This does NOT work for
the <t_xx> termcap codes, these can only be used in mappings.

							*:source_crnl* *W15*
MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2: Files that are read with ":source" normally have
<CR><NL> <EOL>s.  These always work.  If you are using a file with <NL> <EOL>s
(for example, a file made on Unix), this will be recognized if 'fileformats'
is not empty and the first line does not end in a <CR>.  This fails if the
first line has something like ":map <F1> :help^M", where "^M" is a <CR>.  If
the first line ends in a <CR>, but following ones don't, you will get an error
message, because the <CR> from the first lines will be lost.

Mac Classic: Files that are read with ":source" normally have <CR> <EOL>s.
These always work.  If you are using a file with <NL> <EOL>s (for example, a
file made on Unix), this will be recognized if 'fileformats' is not empty and
the first line does not end in a <CR>.  Be careful not to use a file with <NL>
linebreaks which has a <CR> in first line.

On other systems, Vim expects ":source"ed files to end in a <NL>.  These
always work.  If you are using a file with <CR><NL> <EOL>s (for example, a
file made on MS-DOS), all lines will have a trailing <CR>.  This may cause
problems for some commands (e.g., mappings).  There is no automatic <EOL>
detection, because it's common to start with a line that defines a mapping
that ends in a <CR>, which will confuse the automaton.

							*line-continuation*
Long lines in a ":source"d Ex command script file can be split by inserting
a line continuation symbol "\" (backslash) at the start of the next line.
There can be white space before the backslash, which is ignored.

Example: the lines >
	:set comments=sr:/*,mb:*,el:*/,
		     \://,
		     \b:#,
		     \:%,
		     \n:>,
		     \fb:-
are interpreted as if they were given in one line:
	:set comments=sr:/*,mb:*,el:*/,://,b:#,:%,n:>,fb:-

All leading whitespace characters in the line before a backslash are ignored.
Note however that trailing whitespace in the line before it cannot be
inserted freely; it depends on the position where a command is split up
whether additional whitespace is allowed or not.

When a space is required it's best to put it right after the backslash.  A
space at the end of a line is hard to see and may be accidentally deleted. >
	:syn match Comment
		\ "very long regexp"
		\ keepend

There is a problem with the ":append" and ":insert" commands: >
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
The backslash is seen as a line-continuation symbol, thus this results in the
command: >
   :1appendasdf
   .
To avoid this, add the 'C' flag to the 'cpoptions' option: >
   :set cpo+=C
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
   :set cpo-=C

Note that when the commands are inside a function, you need to add the 'C'
flag when defining the function, it is not relevant when executing it. >
   :set cpo+=C
   :function Foo()
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
   :endfunction
   :set cpo-=C

Rationale:
	Most programs work with a trailing backslash to indicate line
	continuation.  Using this in Vim would cause incompatibility with Vi.
	For example for this Vi mapping: >
		:map xx  asdf\
<	Therefore the unusual leading backslash is used.

==============================================================================
5. Debugging scripts					*debug-scripts*

Besides the obvious messages that you can add to your scripts to find out what
they are doing, Vim offers a debug mode.  This allows you to step through a
sourced file or user function and set breakpoints.

NOTE: The debugging mode is far from perfect.  Debugging will have side
effects on how Vim works.  You cannot use it to debug everything.  For
example, the display is messed up by the debugging messages.
{Vi does not have a debug mode}

An alternative to debug mode is setting the 'verbose' option.  With a bigger
number it will give more verbose messages about what Vim is doing.


STARTING DEBUG MODE						*debug-mode*

To enter debugging mode use one of these methods:
1. Start Vim with the |-D| argument: >
	vim -D file.txt
<  Debugging will start as soon as the first vimrc file is sourced.  This is
   useful to find out what is happening when Vim is starting up.  A side
   effect is that Vim will switch the terminal mode before initialisations
   have finished, with unpredictable results.
   For a GUI-only version (Windows, Macintosh) the debugging will start as
   soon as the GUI window has been opened.  To make this happen early, add a
   ":gui" command in the vimrc file.
								*:debug*
2. Run a command with ":debug" prepended.  Debugging will only be done while
   this command executes.  Useful for debugging a specific script or user
   function.  And for scripts and functions used by autocommands.  Example: >
	:debug edit test.txt.gz

3. Set a breakpoint in a sourced file or user function.  You could do this in
   the command line: >
	vim -c "breakadd file */explorer.vim" .
<  This will run Vim and stop in the first line of the "explorer.vim" script.
   Breakpoints can also be set while in debugging mode.

In debugging mode every executed command is displayed before it is executed.
Comment lines, empty lines and lines that are not executed are skipped.  When
a line contains two commands, separated by "|", each command will be displayed
separately.


DEBUG MODE

Once in debugging mode, the usual Ex commands can be used.  For example, to
inspect the value of a variable: >
	echo idx
When inside a user function, this will print the value of the local variable
"idx".  Prepend "g:" to get the value of a global variable: >
	echo g:idx
All commands are executed in the context of the current function or script.
You can also set options, for example setting or resetting 'verbose' will show
what happens, but you might want to set it just before executing the lines you
are interested in: >
	:set verbose=20

Commands that require updating the screen should be avoided, because their
effect won't be noticed until after leaving debug mode.  For example: >
	:help
won't be very helpful.

There is a separate command-line history for debug mode.

The line number for a function line is relative to the start of the function.
If you have trouble figuring out where you are, edit the file that defines
the function in another Vim, search for the start of the function and do
"99j".  Replace "99" with the line number.

Additionally, these commands can be used:
							*>cont*
	cont		Continue execution until the next breakpoint is hit.
							*>quit*
	quit		Abort execution.  This is like using CTRL-C, some
			things might still be executed, doesn't abort
			everything.  Still stops at the next breakpoint.
							*>next*
	next		Execute the command and come back to debug mode when
			it's finished.  This steps over user function calls
			and sourced files.
							*>step*
	step		Execute the command and come back to debug mode for
			the next command.  This steps into called user
			functions and sourced files.
							*>interrupt*
	interrupt	This is like using CTRL-C, but unlike ">quit" comes
			back to debug mode for the next command that is
			executed.  Useful for testing |:finally| and |:catch|
			on interrupt exceptions.
							*>finish*
	finish		Finish the current script or user function and come
			back to debug mode for the command after the one that
			sourced or called it.

About the additional commands in debug mode:
- There is no command-line completion for them, you get the completion for the
  normal Ex commands only.
- You can shorten them, up to a single character: "c", "n", "s" and "f".
- Hitting <CR> will repeat the previous one.  When doing another command, this
  is reset (because it's not clear what you want to repeat).
- When you want to use the Ex command with the same name, prepend a colon:
  ":cont", ":next", ":finish" (or shorter).


DEFINING BREAKPOINTS
							*:breaka* *:breakadd*
:breaka[dd] func [lnum] {name}
		Set a breakpoint in a function.  Example: >
			:breakadd func Explore
<		Doesn't check for a valid function name, thus the breakpoint
		can be set before the function is defined.

:breaka[dd] file [lnum] {name}
		Set a breakpoint in a sourced file.  Example: >
			:breakadd file 43 .vimrc

:breaka[dd] here
		Set a breakpoint in the current line of the current file.
		Like doing: >
			:breakadd file <cursor-line> <current-file>
<		Note that this only works for commands that are executed when
		sourcing the file, not for a function defined in that file.

The [lnum] is the line number of the breakpoint.  Vim will stop at or after
this line.  When omitted line 1 is used.

							*:debug-name*
{name} is a pattern that is matched with the file or function name.  The
pattern is like what is used for autocommands.  There must be a full match (as
if the pattern starts with "^" and ends in "$").  A "*" matches any sequence
of characters.  'ignorecase' is not used, but "\c" can be used in the pattern
to ignore case |/\c|.  Don't include the () for the function name!

The match for sourced scripts is done against the full file name.  If no path
is specified the current directory is used.  Examples: >
	breakadd file explorer.vim
matches "explorer.vim" in the current directory. >
	breakadd file *explorer.vim
matches ".../plugin/explorer.vim", ".../plugin/iexplorer.vim", etc. >
	breakadd file */explorer.vim
matches ".../plugin/explorer.vim" and "explorer.vim" in any other directory.

The match for functions is done against the name as it's shown in the output
of ":function".  For local functions this means that something like "<SNR>99_"
is prepended.

Note that functions are first loaded and later executed.  When they are loaded
the "file" breakpoints are checked, when they are executed the "func"
breakpoints.


DELETING BREAKPOINTS
						*:breakd* *:breakdel* *E161*
:breakd[el] {nr}
		Delete breakpoint {nr}.  Use |:breaklist| to see the number of
		each breakpoint.

:breakd[el] *
		Delete all breakpoints.

:breakd[el] func [lnum] {name}
		Delete a breakpoint in a function.

:breakd[el] file [lnum] {name}
		Delete a breakpoint in a sourced file.

:breakd[el] here
		Delete a breakpoint at the current line of the current file.

When [lnum] is omitted, the first breakpoint in the function or file is
deleted.
The {name} must be exactly the same as what was typed for the ":breakadd"
command.  "explorer", "*explorer.vim" and "*explorer*" are different.


LISTING BREAKPOINTS
							*:breakl* *:breaklist*
:breakl[ist]
		List all breakpoints.


OBSCURE

						*:debugg* *:debuggreedy*
:debugg[reedy]
		Read debug mode commands from the normal input stream, instead
		of getting them directly from the user.  Only useful for test
		scripts.  Example: >
		  echo 'q^Mq' | vim -e -s -c debuggreedy -c 'breakadd file script.vim' -S script.vim

:0debugg[reedy]
		Undo ":debuggreedy": get debug mode commands directly from the
		user, don't use typeahead for debug commands.

==============================================================================
6. Profiling						*profile* *profiling*

Profiling means that Vim measures the time that is spent on executing
functions and/or scripts.  The |+profile| feature is required for this.
It is only included when Vim was compiled with "huge" features.
{Vi does not have profiling}

You can also use the |reltime()| function to measure time.  This only requires
the |+reltime| feature, which is present more often.

For profiling syntax highlighting see |:syntime|.

For example, to profile the one_script.vim script file: >
	:profile start /tmp/one_script_profile
	:profile file one_script.vim
	:source one_script.vim
	:exit


:prof[ile] start {fname}			*:prof* *:profile* *E750*
		Start profiling, write the output in {fname} upon exit.
		If {fname} already exists it will be silently overwritten.
		The variable |v:profiling| is set to one.

:prof[ile] pause
		Don't profile until the following ":profile continue".  Can be
		used when doing something that should not be counted (e.g., an
		external command).  Does not nest.

:prof[ile] continue
		Continue profiling after ":profile pause".

:prof[ile] func {pattern}
		Profile function that matches the pattern {pattern}.
		See |:debug-name| for how {pattern} is used.

:prof[ile][!] file {pattern}
		Profile script file that matches the pattern {pattern}.
		See |:debug-name| for how {pattern} is used.
		This only profiles the script itself, not the functions
		defined in it.
		When the [!] is added then all functions defined in the script
		will also be profiled.
		Note that profiling only starts when the script is loaded
		after this command.  A :profile command in the script itself
		won't work.


:profd[el] ...						*:profd* *:profdel*
		Stop profiling for the arguments specified. See |:breakdel|
		for the arguments.


You must always start with a ":profile start fname" command.  The resulting
file is written when Vim exits.  Here is an example of the output, with line
numbers prepended for the explanation:

  1 FUNCTION  Test2() ~
  2 Called 1 time ~
  3 Total time:   0.155251 ~
  4  Self time:   0.002006 ~
  5  ~
  6 count  total (s)   self (s) ~
  7	9	       0.000096   for i in range(8) ~
  8	8   0.153655   0.000410     call Test3() ~
  9	8	       0.000070   endfor ~
 10				  " Ask a question ~
 11	1	       0.001341   echo input("give me an answer: ") ~

The header (lines 1-4) gives the time for the whole function.  The "Total"
time is the time passed while the function was executing.  The "Self" time is
the "Total" time reduced by time spent in:
- other user defined functions
- sourced scripts
- executed autocommands
- external (shell) commands

Lines 7-11 show the time spent in each executed line.  Lines that are not
executed do not count.  Thus a comment line is never counted.

The Count column shows how many times a line was executed.  Note that the
"for" command in line 7 is executed one more time as the following lines.
That is because the line is also executed to detect the end of the loop.

The time Vim spends waiting for user input isn't counted at all.  Thus how
long you take to respond to the input() prompt is irrelevant.

Profiling should give a good indication of where time is spent, but keep in
mind there are various things that may clobber the results:

- The accuracy of the time measured depends on the gettimeofday() system
  function.  It may only be as accurate as 1/100 second, even though the times
  are displayed in micro seconds.

- Real elapsed time is measured, if other processes are busy they may cause
  delays at unpredictable moments.  You may want to run the profiling several
  times and use the lowest results.

- If you have several commands in one line you only get one time.  Split the
  line to see the time for the individual commands.

- The time of the lines added up is mostly less than the time of the whole
  function.  There is some overhead in between.

- Functions that are deleted before Vim exits will not produce profiling
  information.  You can check the |v:profiling| variable if needed: >
	:if !v:profiling
	:   delfunc MyFunc
	:endif
<
- Profiling may give weird results on multi-processor systems, when sleep
  mode kicks in or the processor frequency is reduced to save power.

- The "self" time is wrong when a function is used recursively.

Last change: 2006 Apr 24


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Avner Lottem
					  updated by Nadim Shaikli


Right to Left display mode for Vim				*rileft*


These functions were originally created by Avner Lottem:
   E-mail: alottem@iil.intel.com
   Phone:  +972-4-8307322

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

								*E26*
{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft| feature}


Introduction
------------
Some languages such as Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew (among others) require the
ability to display their text from right-to-left.  Files in those languages
are stored conventionally and the right-to-left requirement is only a
function of the display engine (per the Unicode specification).  In
right-to-left oriented files the characters appear on the screen from
right to left.

Bidirectionality (or bidi for short) is what Unicode offers as a full
solution to these languages.  Bidi offers the user the ability to view
both right-to-left as well as left-to-right text properly at the same time
within the same window.  Vim currently, due to simplicity, does not offer
bidi and is merely opting to present a functional means to display/enter/use
right-to-left languages.  An older hybrid solution in which direction is
encoded for every character (or group of characters) are not supported either
as this kind of support is out of the scope of a simple addition to an
existing editor (and it's not sanctioned by Unicode either).


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim, no change.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.  File orientation
   is per window, so it is possible to view the same file in right-to-left
   and left-to-right modes, simultaneously.  (Useful for editing mixed files
   in which both right-to-left and left-to-right text exist).

o  Compatibility to the original Vim.  Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (see Bugs below).

o  Backing from reverse insert mode to the correct place in the file
   (if possible).

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.  The
   right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.

o  Many languages use and require right-to-left support.  These languages
   can quite easily be supported given the inclusion of their required
   keyboard mappings and some possible minor code change.  Some of the
   current supported languages include - |arabic.txt|, |farsi.txt| and
   |hebrew.txt|.


Of Interest...
--------------

o  Invocations
   -----------
   + 'rightleft' ('rl') sets window orientation to right-to-left.
   + 'delcombine' ('deco'), boolean, if editing UTF-8 encoded languages,
     allows one to remove a composing character which gets superimposed
     on those that proceeded them (some languages require this).
   + 'rightleftcmd' ('rlc') sets the command-line within certain modes
     (such as search) to be utilized in right-to-left orientation as well.

o  Typing backwards					*ins-reverse*
   ----------------
   In lieu of using full-fledged the 'rightleft' option, one can opt for
   reverse insertion.  When the 'revins' (reverse insert) option is set,
   inserting happens backwards.  This can be used to type right-to-left
   text.  When inserting characters the cursor is not moved and the text
   moves rightwards.  A <BS> deletes the character under the cursor.
   CTRL-W and CTRL-U also work in the opposite direction.  <BS>, CTRL-W
   and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of insert or end of line, no matter
   how the 'backspace' option is set.

   There is no reverse replace mode (yet).

   If the 'showmode' option is set, "-- REVERSE INSERT --" will be shown
   in the status line when reverse Insert mode is active.

o  Pasting when in a rightleft window
   ----------------------------------
   When cutting text with the mouse and pasting it in a rightleft window
   the text will be reversed, because the characters come from the cut buffer
   from the left to the right, while inserted in the file from the right to
   the left.   In order to avoid it, toggle 'revins' before pasting.


Bugs
----
o  Does not handle CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands (add and subtract) correctly
   when in rightleft window.

o  Does not support reverse insert and rightleft modes on the command-line.
   However, functionality of the editor is not reduced, because it is
   possible to enter mappings, abbreviations and searches typed from the
   left to the right on the command-line.

o  Somewhat slower in right-to-left mode, because right-to-left motion is
   emulated inside Vim, not by the controlling terminal.

o  When the Athena GUI is used, the bottom scrollbar works in the wrong
   direction.  This is difficult to fix.

o  When both 'rightleft' and 'revins' are on: 'textwidth' does not work.
   Lines do not wrap at all; you just get a single, long line.

Russian language localization and support in Vim	   *russian* *Russian*

1. Introduction				  |russian-intro|
2. Russian keymaps			  |russian-keymap|
3. Localization				  |russian-l18n|
4. Known issues				  |russian-issues|

===============================================================================
1. Introduction							*russian-intro*

Russian language is supported perfectly well in Vim.  You can type and view
Russian text just as any other, without the need to tweak the settings.

===============================================================================
2. Russian keymaps					       *russian-keymap*

To switch between languages you can use your system native keyboard switcher,
or use one of the Russian keymaps, included in the Vim distribution.  For
example,
>
    :set keymap=russian-jcukenwin
<
In the latter case, you can switch between languages even if you do not have
system Russian keyboard or independently from a system-wide keyboard settings.
See 'keymap'.  You can also map a key to switch between keyboards, if you
choose the latter option.  See |:map|.

For your convenience, to avoid switching between keyboards, when you need to
enter Normal mode command, you can also set 'langmap' option:
>
    :set langmap=;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,
    ;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

This is in utf-8, you cannot read this if your 'encoding' is not utf-8.
You have to type this command in one line, it is wrapped for the sake of
readability.

===============================================================================
3. Localization							 *russian-l18n*

If you wish to use messages, help files, menus and other items translated to
Russian, you will need to install the RuVim Language Pack, available in
different codepages from

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ruvim/

Make sure that your Vim is at least 6.2.506 and use ruvim 0.5 or later for
automatic installs.  Vim also needs to be compiled with |+gettext| feature for
user interface items translations to work.

After downloading an archive from RuVim project, unpack it into your
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  We recommend using UTF-8 archive, if your version of
Vim is compiled with |+multi_byte| feature enabled.

In order to use the Russian documentation, make sure you have set the
'helplang' option to "ru".

===============================================================================
4. Known issues						       *russian-issues*

-- If you are using Russian message translations in Win32 console, then
   you may see the output produced by "vim --help", "vim --version" commands
   and Win32 console window title appearing in a wrong codepage.  This problem
   is related to a bug in GNU gettext library and may be fixed in the future
   releases of gettext.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Scrolling						*scrolling*

These commands move the contents of the window.  If the cursor position is
moved off of the window, the cursor is moved onto the window (with
'scrolloff' screen lines around it).  A page is the number of lines in the
window minus two.  The mnemonics for these commands may be a bit confusing.
Remember that the commands refer to moving the window (the part of the buffer
that you see) upwards or downwards in the buffer.  When the window moves
upwards in the buffer, the text in the window moves downwards on your screen.

See section |03.7| of the user manual for an introduction.

1. Scrolling downwards		|scroll-down|
2. Scrolling upwards		|scroll-up|
3. Scrolling relative to cursor	|scroll-cursor|
4. Scrolling horizontally	|scroll-horizontal|
5. Scrolling synchronously	|scroll-binding|
6. Scrolling with a mouse wheel |scroll-mouse-wheel|

==============================================================================
1. Scrolling downwards					*scroll-down*

The following commands move the edit window (the part of the buffer that you
see) downwards (this means that more lines downwards in the text buffer can be
seen):

							*CTRL-E*
CTRL-E			Scroll window [count] lines downwards in the buffer.
			Mnemonic: Extra lines.

							*CTRL-D*
CTRL-D			Scroll window Downwards in the buffer.  The number of
			lines comes from the 'scroll' option (default: half a
			screen).  If [count] given, first set 'scroll' option
			to [count].  The cursor is moved the same number of
			lines down in the file (if possible; when lines wrap
			and when hitting the end of the file there may be a
			difference).  When the cursor is on the last line of
			the buffer nothing happens and a beep is produced.
			See also 'startofline' option.
			{difference from vi: Vim scrolls 'scroll' screen
			lines, instead of file lines; makes a difference when
			lines wrap}

<S-Down>	or				*<S-Down>* *<kPageDown>*
<PageDown>	or				*<PageDown>* *CTRL-F*
CTRL-F			Scroll window [count] pages Forwards (downwards) in
			the buffer.  See also 'startofline' option.
			When there is only one window the 'window' option
			might be used.

							*z+*
z+			Without [count]: Redraw with the line just below the
			window at the top of the window.  Put the cursor in
			that line, at the first non-blank in the line.
			With [count]: just like "z<CR>".

==============================================================================
2. Scrolling upwards					*scroll-up*

The following commands move the edit window (the part of the buffer that you
see) upwards (this means that more lines upwards in the text buffer can be
seen):

							*CTRL-Y*
CTRL-Y			Scroll window [count] lines upwards in the buffer.
			Note: When using the MS-Windows key bindings CTRL-Y is
			remapped to redo.

							*CTRL-U*
CTRL-U			Scroll window Upwards in the buffer.  The number of
			lines comes from the 'scroll' option (default: half a
			screen).  If [count] given, first set the 'scroll'
			option to [count].  The cursor is moved the same
			number of lines up in the file (if possible; when
			lines wrap and when hitting the end of the file there
			may be a difference).  When the cursor is on the first
			line of the buffer nothing happens and a beep is
			produced.  See also 'startofline' option.
			{difference from vi: Vim scrolls 'scroll' screen
			lines, instead of file lines; makes a difference when
			lines wrap}

<S-Up>		or					*<S-Up>* *<kPageUp>*
<PageUp>	or					*<PageUp>* *CTRL-B*
CTRL-B			Scroll window [count] pages Backwards (upwards) in the
			buffer.  See also 'startofline' option.
			When there is only one window the 'window' option
			might be used.

							*z^*
z^			Without [count]: Redraw with the line just above the
			window at the bottom of the window.  Put the cursor in
			that line, at the first non-blank in the line.
			With [count]: First scroll the text to put the [count]
			line at the bottom of the window, then redraw with the
			line which is now at the top of the window at the
			bottom of the window.  Put the cursor in that line, at
			the first non-blank in the line.

==============================================================================
3. Scrolling relative to cursor				*scroll-cursor*

The following commands reposition the edit window (the part of the buffer that
you see) while keeping the cursor on the same line:

							*z<CR>*
z<CR>			Redraw, line [count] at top of window (default
			cursor line).  Put cursor at first non-blank in the
			line.

							*zt*
zt			Like "z<CR>", but leave the cursor in the same
			column.  {not in Vi}

							*zN<CR>*
z{height}<CR>		Redraw, make window {height} lines tall.  This is
			useful to make the number of lines small when screen
			updating is very slow.  Cannot make the height more
			than the physical screen height.

							*z.*
z.			Redraw, line [count] at center of window (default
			cursor line).  Put cursor at first non-blank in the
			line.

							*zz*
zz			Like "z.", but leave the cursor in the same column.
			Careful: If caps-lock is on, this command becomes
			"ZZ": write buffer and exit!  {not in Vi}

							*z-*
z-			Redraw, line [count] at bottom of window (default
			cursor line).  Put cursor at first non-blank in the
			line.

							*zb*
zb			Like "z-", but leave the cursor in the same column.
			{not in Vi}

==============================================================================
4. Scrolling horizontally				*scroll-horizontal*

For the following four commands the cursor follows the screen.  If the
character that the cursor is on is moved off the screen, the cursor is moved
to the closest character that is on the screen.  The value of 'sidescroll' is
not used.

z<Right>    or						*zl* *z<Right>*
zl			Move the view on the text [count] characters to the
			right, thus scroll the text [count] characters to the
			left.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

z<Left>      or						*zh* *z<Left>*
zh			Move the view on the text [count] characters to the
			left, thus scroll the text [count] characters to the
			right.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

							*zL*
zL			Move the view on the text half a screenwidth to the
			right, thus scroll the text half a screenwidth to the
			left.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

							*zH*
zH			Move the view on the text half a screenwidth to the
			left, thus scroll the text half a screenwidth to the
			right.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

For the following two commands the cursor is not moved in the text, only the
text scrolls on the screen.

							*zs*
zs			Scroll the text horizontally to position the cursor
			at the start (left side) of the screen.  This only
			works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in Vi}

							*ze*
ze			Scroll the text horizontally to position the cursor
			at the end (right side) of the screen.  This only
			works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in Vi}

==============================================================================
5. Scrolling synchronously				*scroll-binding*

Occasionally, it is desirable to bind two or more windows together such that
when one window is scrolled, the other windows are also scrolled.  In Vim,
windows can be given this behavior by setting the (window-specific)
'scrollbind' option.  When a window that has 'scrollbind' set is scrolled, all
other 'scrollbind' windows are scrolled the same amount, if possible.  The
behavior of 'scrollbind' can be modified by the 'scrollopt' option.

When using the scrollbars, the binding only happens when scrolling the window
with focus (where the cursor is).  You can use this to avoid scroll-binding
for a moment without resetting options.

When a window also has the 'diff' option set, the scroll-binding uses the
differences between the two buffers to synchronize the position precisely.
Otherwise the following method is used.

							*scrollbind-relative*
Each 'scrollbind' window keeps track of its "relative offset," which can be
thought of as the difference between the current window's vertical scroll
position and the other window's vertical scroll position.  When one of the
'scrollbind' windows is asked to vertically scroll past the beginning or end
limit of its text, the window no longer scrolls, but remembers how far past
the limit it wishes to be.  The window keeps this information so that it can
maintain the same relative offset, regardless of its being asked to scroll
past its buffer's limits.

However, if a 'scrollbind' window that has a relative offset that is past its
buffer's limits is given the cursor focus, the other 'scrollbind' windows must
jump to a location where the current window's relative offset is valid.  This
behavior can be changed by clearing the 'jump' flag from the 'scrollopt'
option.

						*syncbind* *:syncbind* *:sync*
:syncbind		Force all 'scrollbind' windows to have the same
			relative offset.  I.e., when any of the 'scrollbind'
			windows is scrolled to the top of its buffer, all of
			the 'scrollbind' windows will also be at the top of
			their buffers.

							*scrollbind-quickadj*
The 'scrollbind' flag is meaningful when using keyboard commands to vertically
scroll a window, and also meaningful when using the vertical scrollbar of the
window which has the cursor focus.  However, when using the vertical scrollbar
of a window which doesn't have the cursor focus, 'scrollbind' is ignored.
This allows quick adjustment of the relative offset of 'scrollbind' windows.

==============================================================================
6. Scrolling with a mouse wheel				*scroll-mouse-wheel*

When your mouse has a scroll wheel, it should work with Vim in the GUI.  How
it works depends on your system.  It might also work in an xterm
|xterm-mouse-wheel|.  By default only vertical scroll wheels are supported,
but some GUIs also support horizontal scroll wheels.

For the Win32 GUI the scroll action is hard coded.  It works just like
dragging the scrollbar of the current window.  How many lines are scrolled
depends on your mouse driver.  If the scroll action causes input focus
problems, see |intellimouse-wheel-problems|.

For the X11 GUIs (Motif, Athena and GTK) scrolling the wheel generates key
presses <ScrollWheelUp>, <ScrollWheelDown>, <ScrollWheelLeft> and
<ScrollWheelRight>.  For example, if you push the scroll wheel upwards a
<ScrollWheelUp> key press is generated causing the window to scroll upwards
(while the text is actually moving downwards).  The default action for these
keys are:
    <ScrollWheelUp>	    scroll three lines up	*<ScrollWheelUp>*
    <S-ScrollWheelUp>	    scroll one page up		*<S-ScrollWheelUp>*
    <C-ScrollWheelUp>	    scroll one page up		*<C-ScrollWheelUp>*
    <ScrollWheelDown>	    scroll three lines down	*<ScrollWheelDown>*
    <S-ScrollWheelDown>	    scroll one page down	*<S-ScrollWheelDown>*
    <C-ScrollWheelDown>	    scroll one page down	*<C-ScrollWheelDown>*
    <ScrollWheelLeft>	    scroll six columns left	*<ScrollWheelLeft>*
    <S-ScrollWheelLeft>	    scroll one page left	*<S-ScrollWheelLeft>*
    <C-ScrollWheelLeft>	    scroll one page left	*<C-ScrollWheelLeft>*
    <ScrollWheelRight>	    scroll six columns right	*<ScrollWheelRight>*
    <S-ScrollWheelRight>    scroll one page right	*<S-ScrollWheelRight>*
    <C-ScrollWheelRight>    scroll one page right	*<C-ScrollWheelRight>*
This should work in all modes, except when editing the command line.

Note that horizontal scrolling only works if 'nowrap' is set.  Also, unless
the "h" flag in 'guioptions' is set, the cursor moves to the longest visible
line if the cursor line is about to be scrolled off the screen (similarly to
how the horizontal scrollbar works).

You can modify the default behavior by mapping the keys.  For example, to make
the scroll wheel move one line or half a page in Normal mode: >
   :map <ScrollWheelUp> <C-Y>
   :map <S-ScrollWheelUp> <C-U>
   :map <ScrollWheelDown> <C-E>
   :map <S-ScrollWheelDown> <C-D>
You can also use Alt and Ctrl modifiers.

This only works when Vim gets the scroll wheel events, of course.  You can
check if this works with the "xev" program.

When using XFree86, the /etc/XF86Config file should have the correct entry for
your mouse.  For FreeBSD, this entry works for a Logitech scrollmouse: >
    Protocol     "MouseMan"
    Device       "/dev/psm0"
    ZAxisMapping 4 5
See the XFree86 documentation for information.

						*<MouseDown>* *<MouseUp>*
The keys <MouseDown> and <MouseUp> have been deprecated.  Use <ScrollWheelUp>
instead of <MouseDown> and use <ScrollWheelDown> instead of <MouseUp>.

							*xterm-mouse-wheel*
To use the mouse wheel in a new xterm you only have to make the scroll wheel
work in your Xserver, as mentioned above.

To use the mouse wheel in an older xterm you must do this:
1. Make it work in your Xserver, as mentioned above.
2. Add translations for the xterm, so that the xterm will pass a scroll event
   to Vim as an escape sequence.
3. Add mappings in Vim, to interpret the escape sequences as <ScrollWheelDown>
   or <ScrollWheelUp> keys.

You can do the translations by adding this to your ~.Xdefaults file (or other
file where your X resources are kept): >

  XTerm*VT100.Translations:		#override \n\
		s<Btn4Down>: string("0x9b") string("[64~") \n\
		s<Btn5Down>: string("0x9b") string("[65~") \n\
		<Btn4Down>: string("0x9b") string("[62~") \n\
		<Btn5Down>: string("0x9b") string("[63~") \n\
		<Btn4Up>: \n\
		<Btn5Up>:

Add these mappings to your vimrc file: >
	:map <M-Esc>[62~ <ScrollWheelUp>
	:map! <M-Esc>[62~ <ScrollWheelUp>
	:map <M-Esc>[63~ <ScrollWheelDown>
	:map! <M-Esc>[63~ <ScrollWheelDown>
	:map <M-Esc>[64~ <S-ScrollWheelUp>
	:map! <M-Esc>[64~ <S-ScrollWheelUp>
	:map <M-Esc>[65~ <S-ScrollWheelDown>
	:map! <M-Esc>[65~ <S-ScrollWheelDown>

Sign Support Features				*sign-support*

1. Introduction				|sign-intro|
2. Commands				|sign-commands|

{Vi does not have any of these features}
{only available when compiled with the |+signs| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*sign-intro* *signs*

When a debugger or other IDE tool is driving an editor it needs to be able
to give specific highlights which quickly tell the user useful information
about the file.  One example of this would be a debugger which had an icon
in the left-hand column denoting a breakpoint.  Another example might be an
arrow representing the Program Counter (PC).  The sign features allow both
placement of a sign, or icon, in the left-hand side of the window and
definition of a highlight which will be applied to that line.  Displaying the
sign as an image is most likely only feasible in gvim (although Sun
Microsystem's dtterm does support this it's the only terminal emulator I know
of which does).  A text sign and the highlight should be feasible in any color
terminal emulator.

Signs and highlights are not useful just for debuggers.  Sun's Visual
WorkShop uses signs and highlights to mark build errors and SourceBrowser
hits.  Additionally, the debugger supports 8 to 10 different signs and
highlight colors. |workshop|  Same for Netbeans |netbeans|.

There are two steps in using signs:

1. Define the sign.  This specifies the image, text and highlighting.  For
   example, you can define a "break" sign with an image of a stop roadsign and
   text "!!".

2. Place the sign.  This specifies the file and line number where the sign is
   displayed.  A defined sign can be placed several times in different lines
   and files.

When signs are defined for a file, Vim will automatically add a column of two
characters to display them in.  When the last sign is unplaced the column
disappears again.  The color of the column is set with the SignColumn group
|hl-SignColumn|.  Example to set the color: >

	:highlight SignColumn guibg=darkgrey

==============================================================================
2. Commands					*sign-commands* *:sig* *:sign*

Here is an example that places a sign "piet", displayed with the text ">>", in
line 23 of the current file: >
	:sign define piet text=>> texthl=Search
	:exe ":sign place 2 line=23 name=piet file=" . expand("%:p")

And here is the command to delete it again: >
	:sign unplace 2

Note that the ":sign" command cannot be followed by another command or a
comment.  If you do need that, use the |:execute| command.


DEFINING A SIGN.			*:sign-define* *E255* *E160* *E612*

:sign define {name} {argument}...
		Define a new sign or set attributes for an existing sign.
		The {name} can either be a number (all digits) or a name
		starting with a non-digit.  Leading digits are ignored, thus
		"0012", "012" and "12" are considered the same name.
		About 120 different signs can be defined.

		Accepted arguments:

	icon={bitmap}
		Define the file name where the bitmap can be found.  Should be
		a full path.  The bitmap should fit in the place of two
		characters.  This is not checked.  If the bitmap is too big it
		will cause redraw problems.  Only GTK 2 can scale the bitmap
		to fit the space available.
			toolkit		supports ~
			GTK 1		pixmap (.xpm)
			GTK 2		many
			Motif		pixmap (.xpm)
			Win32		.bmp, .ico, .cur
					pixmap (.xpm) |+xpm_w32|

	linehl={group}
		Highlighting group used for the whole line the sign is placed
		in.  Most useful is defining a background color.

	text={text}						*E239*
		Define the text that is displayed when there is no icon or the
		GUI is not being used.  Only printable characters are allowed
		and they must occupy one or two display cells.

	texthl={group}
		Highlighting group used for the text item.


DELETING A SIGN						*:sign-undefine* *E155*

:sign undefine {name}
		Deletes a previously defined sign.  If signs with this {name}
		are still placed this will cause trouble.


LISTING SIGNS						*:sign-list* *E156*

:sign list	Lists all defined signs and their attributes.

:sign list {name}
		Lists one defined sign and its attributes.


PLACING SIGNS						*:sign-place* *E158*

:sign place {id} line={lnum} name={name} file={fname}
		Place sign defined as {name} at line {lnum} in file {fname}.
							*:sign-fname*
		The file {fname} must already be loaded in a buffer.  The
		exact file name must be used, wildcards, $ENV and ~ are not
		expanded, white space must not be escaped.  Trailing white
		space is ignored.

		The sign is remembered under {id}, this can be used for
		further manipulation.  {id} must be a number.
		It's up to the user to make sure the {id} is used only once in
		each file (if it's used several times unplacing will also have
		to be done several times and making changes may not work as
		expected).

:sign place {id} line={lnum} name={name} buffer={nr}
		Same, but use buffer {nr}.

							*E885*
:sign place {id} name={name} file={fname}
		Change the placed sign {id} in file {fname} to use the defined
		sign {name}.  See remark above about {fname} |:sign-fname|.
		This can be used to change the displayed sign without moving
		it (e.g., when the debugger has stopped at a breakpoint).

:sign place {id} name={name} buffer={nr}
		Same, but use buffer {nr}.


REMOVING SIGNS						*:sign-unplace* *E159*

:sign unplace {id} file={fname}
		Remove the previously placed sign {id} from file {fname}.
		See remark above about {fname} |:sign-fname|.

:sign unplace * file={fname}
		Remove all placed signs in file {fname}.

:sign unplace {id} buffer={nr}
		Remove the previously placed sign {id} from buffer {nr}.

:sign unplace * buffer={nr}
		Remove all placed signs in buffer {nr}.

:sign unplace {id}
		Remove the previously placed sign {id} from all files it
		appears in.

:sign unplace *
		Remove all placed signs.

:sign unplace
		Remove the placed sign at the cursor position.


LISTING PLACED SIGNS					*:sign-place-list*

:sign place file={fname}
		List signs placed in file {fname}.
		See remark above about {fname} |:sign-fname|.

:sign place buffer={nr}
		List signs placed in buffer {nr}.

:sign place	List placed signs in all files.


JUMPING TO A SIGN					*:sign-jump* *E157*

:sign jump {id} file={fname}
		Open the file {fname} or jump to the window that contains
		{fname} and position the cursor at sign {id}.
		See remark above about {fname} |:sign-fname|.
		If the file isn't displayed in window and the current file can
		not be |abandon|ed this fails.

:sign jump {id} buffer={nr}
		Same, but use buffer {nr}.

Spell checking						*spell*

1. Quick start			|spell-quickstart|
2. Remarks on spell checking	|spell-remarks|
3. Generating a spell file	|spell-mkspell|
4. Spell file format		|spell-file-format|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

Spell checking is not available when the |+syntax| feature has been disabled
at compile time.

Note: There also is a vimspell plugin.  If you have it you can do ":help
vimspell" to find about it.  But you will probably want to get rid of the
plugin and use the 'spell' option instead, it works better.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start					*spell-quickstart* *E756*

This command switches on spell checking: >

	:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us

This switches on the 'spell' option and specifies to check for US English.

The words that are not recognized are highlighted with one of these:
	SpellBad	word not recognized			|hl-SpellBad|
	SpellCap	word not capitalised			|hl-SpellCap|
	SpellRare	rare word				|hl-SpellRare|
	SpellLocal	wrong spelling for selected region	|hl-SpellLocal|

Vim only checks words for spelling, there is no grammar check.

If the 'mousemodel' option is set to "popup" and the cursor is on a badly
spelled word or it is "popup_setpos" and the mouse pointer is on a badly
spelled word, then the popup menu will contain a submenu to replace the bad
word.  Note: this slows down the appearance of the popup menu.  Note for GTK:
don't release the right mouse button until the menu appears, otherwise it
won't work.

To search for the next misspelled word:

							*]s*
]s			Move to next misspelled word after the cursor.
			A count before the command can be used to repeat.
			'wrapscan' applies.

							*[s*
[s			Like "]s" but search backwards, find the misspelled
			word before the cursor.  Doesn't recognize words
			split over two lines, thus may stop at words that are
			not highlighted as bad.  Does not stop at word with
			missing capital at the start of a line.

							*]S*
]S			Like "]s" but only stop at bad words, not at rare
			words or words for another region.

							*[S*
[S			Like "]S" but search backwards.


To add words to your own word list:

							*zg*
zg			Add word under the cursor as a good word to the first
			name in 'spellfile'.  A count may precede the command
			to indicate the entry in 'spellfile' to be used.  A
			count of two uses the second entry.

			In Visual mode the selected characters are added as a
			word (including white space!).
			When the cursor is on text that is marked as badly
			spelled then the marked text is used.
			Otherwise the word under the cursor, separated by
			non-word characters, is used.

			If the word is explicitly marked as bad word in
			another spell file the result is unpredictable.

							*zG*
zG			Like "zg" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

							*zw*
zw			Like "zg" but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word.
			If the word already appears in 'spellfile' it is
			turned into a comment line.  See |spellfile-cleanup|
			for getting rid of those.

							*zW*
zW			Like "zw" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

zuw							*zug* *zuw*
zug			Undo |zw| and |zg|, remove the word from the entry in
			'spellfile'.  Count used as with |zg|.

zuW							*zuG* *zuW*
zuG			Undo |zW| and |zG|, remove the word from the internal
			word list.  Count used as with |zg|.

							*:spe* *:spellgood*
:[count]spe[llgood] {word}
			Add {word} as a good word to 'spellfile', like with
			|zg|.  Without count the first name is used, with a
			count of two the second entry, etc.

:spe[llgood]! {word}	Add {word} as a good word to the internal word list,
			like with |zG|.

							*:spellw* *:spellwrong*
:[count]spellw[rong] {word}
			Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to 'spellfile', as
			with |zw|.  Without count the first name is used, with
			a count of two the second entry, etc.

:spellw[rong]! {word}	Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to the internal word
			list, like with |zW|.

:[count]spellu[ndo] {word}				*:spellu* *:spellundo*
			Like |zuw|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.

:spellu[ndo]! {word}	Like |zuW|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.


After adding a word to 'spellfile' with the above commands its associated
".spl" file will automatically be updated and reloaded.  If you change
'spellfile' manually you need to use the |:mkspell| command.  This sequence of
commands mostly works well: >
	:edit <file in 'spellfile'>
<	(make changes to the spell file) >
	:mkspell! %

More details about the 'spellfile' format below |spell-wordlist-format|.

							*internal-wordlist*
The internal word list is used for all buffers where 'spell' is set.  It is
not stored, it is lost when you exit Vim.  It is also cleared when 'encoding'
is set.


Finding suggestions for bad words:
							*z=*
z=			For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly
			spelled words.  This also works to find alternatives
			for a word that is not highlighted as a bad word,
			e.g., when the word after it is bad.
			In Visual mode the highlighted text is taken as the
			word to be replaced.
			The results are sorted on similarity to the word being
			replaced.
			This may take a long time.  Hit CTRL-C when you get
			bored.

			If the command is used without a count the
			alternatives are listed and you can enter the number
			of your choice or press <Enter> if you don't want to
			replace.  You can also use the mouse to click on your
			choice (only works if the mouse can be used in Normal
			mode and when there are no line wraps).  Click on the
			first line (the header) to cancel.

			The suggestions listed normally replace a highlighted
			bad word.  Sometimes they include other text, in that
			case the replaced text is also listed after a "<".

			If a count is used that suggestion is used, without
			prompting.  For example, "1z=" always takes the first
			suggestion.

			If 'verbose' is non-zero a score will be displayed
			with the suggestions to indicate the likeliness to the
			badly spelled word (the higher the score the more
			different).
			When a word was replaced the redo command "." will
			repeat the word replacement.  This works like "ciw",
			the good word and <Esc>.  This does NOT work for Thai
			and other languages without spaces between words.

					*:spellr* *:spellrepall* *E752* *E753*
:spellr[epall]		Repeat the replacement done by |z=| for all matches
			with the replaced word in the current window.

In Insert mode, when the cursor is after a badly spelled word, you can use
CTRL-X s to find suggestions.  This works like Insert mode completion.  Use
CTRL-N to use the next suggestion, CTRL-P to go back. |i_CTRL-X_s|

The 'spellsuggest' option influences how the list of suggestions is generated
and sorted.  See |'spellsuggest'|.

The 'spellcapcheck' option is used to check the first word of a sentence
starts with a capital.  This doesn't work for the first word in the file.
When there is a line break right after a sentence the highlighting of the next
line may be postponed.  Use |CTRL-L| when needed.  Also see |set-spc-auto| for
how it can be set automatically when 'spelllang' is set.

Vim counts the number of times a good word is encountered.  This is used to
sort the suggestions: words that have been seen before get a small bonus,
words that have been seen often get a bigger bonus.  The COMMON item in the
affix file can be used to define common words, so that this mechanism also
works in a new or short file |spell-COMMON|.

==============================================================================
2. Remarks on spell checking				*spell-remarks*

PERFORMANCE

Vim does on-the-fly spell checking.  To make this work fast the word list is
loaded in memory.  Thus this uses a lot of memory (1 Mbyte or more).  There
might also be a noticeable delay when the word list is loaded, which happens
when 'spell' is set and when 'spelllang' is set while 'spell' was already set.
To minimize the delay each word list is only loaded once, it is not deleted
when 'spelllang' is made empty or 'spell' is reset.  When 'encoding' is set
all the word lists are reloaded, thus you may notice a delay then too.


REGIONS

A word may be spelled differently in various regions.  For example, English
comes in (at least) these variants:

	en		all regions
	en_au		Australia
	en_ca		Canada
	en_gb		Great Britain
	en_nz		New Zealand
	en_us		USA

Words that are not used in one region but are used in another region are
highlighted with SpellLocal |hl-SpellLocal|.

Always use lowercase letters for the language and region names.

When adding a word with |zg| or another command it's always added for all
regions.  You can change that by manually editing the 'spellfile'.  See
|spell-wordlist-format|.  Note that the regions as specified in the files in
'spellfile' are only used when all entries in 'spelllang' specify the same
region (not counting files specified by their .spl name).

							*spell-german*
Specific exception: For German these special regions are used:
	de		all German words accepted
	de_de		old and new spelling
	de_19		old spelling
	de_20		new spelling
	de_at		Austria
	de_ch		Switzerland

							*spell-russian*
Specific exception: For Russian these special regions are used:
	ru		all Russian words accepted
	ru_ru		"IE" letter spelling
	ru_yo		"YO" letter spelling

							*spell-yiddish*
Yiddish requires using "utf-8" encoding, because of the special characters
used.  If you are using latin1 Vim will use transliterated (romanized) Yiddish
instead.  If you want to use transliterated Yiddish with utf-8 use "yi-tr".
In a table:
	'encoding'	'spelllang'
	utf-8		yi		Yiddish
	latin1		yi		transliterated Yiddish
	utf-8		yi-tr		transliterated Yiddish

							*spell-cjk*
Chinese, Japanese and other East Asian characters are normally marked as
errors, because spell checking of these characters is not supported. If
'spelllang' includes "cjk", these characters are not marked as errors.  This
is useful when editing text with spell checking while some Asian words are
present.


SPELL FILES						*spell-load*

Vim searches for spell files in the "spell" subdirectory of the directories in
'runtimepath'.  The name is: LL.EEE.spl, where:
	LL	the language name
	EEE	the value of 'encoding'

The value for "LL" comes from 'spelllang', but excludes the region name.
Examples:
	'spelllang'	LL ~
	en_us		en
	en-rare		en-rare
	medical_ca	medical

Only the first file is loaded, the one that is first in 'runtimepath'.  If
this succeeds then additionally files with the name LL.EEE.add.spl are loaded.
All the ones that are found are used.

If no spell file is found the |SpellFileMissing| autocommand event is
triggered.  This may trigger the |spellfile.vim| plugin to offer you
downloading the spell file.

Additionally, the files related to the names in 'spellfile' are loaded.  These
are the files that |zg| and |zw| add good and wrong words to.

Exceptions:
- Vim uses "latin1" when 'encoding' is "iso-8859-15".  The euro sign doesn't
  matter for spelling.
- When no spell file for 'encoding' is found "ascii" is tried.  This only
  works for languages where nearly all words are ASCII, such as English.  It
  helps when 'encoding' is not "latin1", such as iso-8859-2, and English text
  is being edited.  For the ".add" files the same name as the found main
  spell file is used.

For example, with these values:
	'runtimepath' is "~/.vim,/usr/share/vim70,~/.vim/after"
	'encoding'    is "iso-8859-2"
	'spelllang'   is "pl"

Vim will look for:
1. ~/.vim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
3. ~/.vim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
4. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
5. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl

This assumes 1. is not found and 2. is found.

If 'encoding' is "latin1" Vim will look for:
1. ~/.vim/spell/pl.latin1.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.latin1.spl
3. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.latin1.spl
4. ~/.vim/spell/pl.ascii.spl
5. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.ascii.spl
6. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.ascii.spl

This assumes none of them are found (Polish doesn't make sense when leaving
out the non-ASCII characters).

Spelling for EBCDIC is currently not supported.

A spell file might not be available in the current 'encoding'.  See
|spell-mkspell| about how to create a spell file.  Converting a spell file
with "iconv" will NOT work!

Note: on VMS ".{enc}.spl" is changed to "_{enc}.spl" to avoid trouble with
filenames.

						    *spell-sug-file* *E781*
If there is a file with exactly the same name as the ".spl" file but ending in
".sug", that file will be used for giving better suggestions.  It isn't loaded
before suggestions are made to reduce memory use.

				    *E758* *E759* *E778* *E779* *E780* *E782*
When loading a spell file Vim checks that it is properly formatted.  If you
get an error the file may be truncated, modified or intended for another Vim
version.


SPELLFILE CLEANUP					*spellfile-cleanup*

The |zw| command turns existing entries in 'spellfile' into comment lines.
This avoids having to write a new file every time, but results in the file
only getting longer, never shorter.  To clean up the comment lines in all
".add" spell files do this: >
	:runtime spell/cleanadd.vim

This deletes all comment lines, except the ones that start with "##".  Use
"##" lines to add comments that you want to keep.

You can invoke this script as often as you like.  A variable is provided to
skip updating files that have been changed recently.  Set it to the number of
seconds that has passed since a file was changed before it will be cleaned.
For example, to clean only files that were not changed in the last hour: >
      let g:spell_clean_limit = 60 * 60
The default is one second.


WORDS

Vim uses a fixed method to recognize a word.  This is independent of
'iskeyword', so that it also works in help files and for languages that
include characters like '-' in 'iskeyword'.  The word characters do depend on
'encoding'.

The table with word characters is stored in the main .spl file.  Therefore it
matters what the current locale is when generating it!  A .add.spl file does
not contain a word table though.

For a word that starts with a digit the digit is ignored, unless the word as a
whole is recognized.  Thus if "3D" is a word and "D" is not then "3D" is
recognized as a word, but if "3D" is not a word then only the "D" is marked as
bad.  Hex numbers in the form 0x12ab and 0X12AB are recognized.


WORD COMBINATIONS

It is possible to spell-check words that include a space.  This is used to
recognize words that are invalid when used by themselves, e.g. for "et al.".
It can also be used to recognize "the the" and highlight it.

The number of spaces is irrelevant.  In most cases a line break may also
appear.  However, this makes it difficult to find out where to start checking
for spelling mistakes.  When you make a change to one line and only that line
is redrawn Vim won't look in the previous line, thus when "et" is at the end
of the previous line "al." will be flagged as an error.  And when you type
"the<CR>the" the highlighting doesn't appear until the first line is redrawn.
Use |CTRL-L| to redraw right away.  "[s" will also stop at a word combination
with a line break.

When encountering a line break Vim skips characters such as '*', '>' and '"',
so that comments in C, shell and Vim code can be spell checked.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING					*spell-syntax*

Files that use syntax highlighting can specify where spell checking should be
done:

1.  everywhere			   default
2.  in specific items		   use "contains=@Spell"
3.  everywhere but specific items  use "contains=@NoSpell"

For the second method adding the @NoSpell cluster will disable spell checking
again.  This can be used, for example, to add @Spell to the comments of a
program, and add @NoSpell for items that shouldn't be checked.
Also see |:syn-spell| for text that is not in a syntax item.


VIM SCRIPTS

If you want to write a Vim script that does something with spelling, you may
find these functions useful:

    spellbadword()	find badly spelled word at the cursor
    spellsuggest()	get list of spelling suggestions
    soundfold()		get the sound-a-like version of a word


SETTING 'spellcapcheck' AUTOMATICALLY			*set-spc-auto*

After the 'spelllang' option has been set successfully, Vim will source the
files "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
up to the first comma, dot or underscore.  This can be used to set options
specifically for the language, especially 'spellcapcheck'.

The distribution includes a few of these files.  Use this command to see what
they do: >
	:next $VIMRUNTIME/spell/*.vim

Note that the default scripts don't set 'spellcapcheck' if it was changed from
the default value.  This assumes the user prefers another value then.


DOUBLE SCORING						*spell-double-scoring*

The 'spellsuggest' option can be used to select "double" scoring.  This
mechanism is based on the principle that there are two kinds of spelling
mistakes:

1. You know how to spell the word, but mistype something.  This results in a
   small editing distance (character swapped/omitted/inserted) and possibly a
   word that sounds completely different.

2. You don't know how to spell the word and type something that sounds right.
   The edit distance can be big but the word is similar after sound-folding.

Since scores for these two mistakes will be very different we use a list
for each and mix them.

The sound-folding is slow and people that know the language won't make the
second kind of mistakes.  Therefore 'spellsuggest' can be set to select the
preferred method for scoring the suggestions.

==============================================================================
3. Generating a spell file				*spell-mkspell*

Vim uses a binary file format for spelling.  This greatly speeds up loading
the word list and keeps it small.
						    *.aff* *.dic* *Myspell*
You can create a Vim spell file from the .aff and .dic files that Myspell
uses.  Myspell is used by OpenOffice.org and Mozilla. The OpenOffice .oxt 
files are zip files which contain the .aff and .dic files. You should be able
to find them here:
	http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary
The older, OpenOffice 2 files may be used if this doesn't work:
	http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries
You can also use a plain word list.  The results are the same, the choice
depends on what word lists you can find.

If you install Aap (from www.a-a-p.org) you can use the recipes in the
runtime/spell/??/ directories.  Aap will take care of downloading the files,
apply patches needed for Vim and build the .spl file.

Make sure your current locale is set properly, otherwise Vim doesn't know what
characters are upper/lower case letters.  If the locale isn't available (e.g.,
when using an MS-Windows codepage on Unix) add tables to the .aff file
|spell-affix-chars|.  If the .aff file doesn't define a table then the word
table of the currently active spelling is used.  If spelling is not active
then Vim will try to guess.

							*:mksp* *:mkspell*
:mksp[ell][!] [-ascii] {outname} {inname} ...
			Generate a Vim spell file from word lists.  Example: >
		:mkspell /tmp/nl nl_NL.words
<								*E751*
			When {outname} ends in ".spl" it is used as the output
			file name.  Otherwise it should be a language name,
			such as "en", without the region name.  The file
			written will be "{outname}.{encoding}.spl", where
			{encoding} is the value of the 'encoding' option.

			When the output file already exists [!] must be used
			to overwrite it.

			When the [-ascii] argument is present, words with
			non-ascii characters are skipped.  The resulting file
			ends in "ascii.spl".

			The input can be the Myspell format files {inname}.aff
			and {inname}.dic.  If {inname}.aff does not exist then
			{inname} is used as the file name of a plain word
			list.

			Multiple {inname} arguments can be given to combine
			regions into one Vim spell file.  Example: >
		:mkspell ~/.vim/spell/en /tmp/en_US /tmp/en_CA /tmp/en_AU
<			This combines the English word lists for US, CA and AU
			into one en.spl file.
			Up to eight regions can be combined. *E754* *E755*
			The REP and SAL items of the first .aff file where
			they appear are used. |spell-REP| |spell-SAL|
								*E845*
			This command uses a lot of memory, required to find
			the optimal word tree (Polish, Italian and Hungarian
			require several hundred Mbyte).  The final result will
			be much smaller, because compression is used.  To
			avoid running out of memory compression will be done
			now and then.  This can be tuned with the 'mkspellmem'
			option.

			After the spell file was written and it was being used
			in a buffer it will be reloaded automatically.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}.{enc}.add
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name}.{enc}.add as the
			input file and producing an output file in the same
			directory that has ".spl" appended.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name} as the input file
			and producing an output file in the same directory
			that has ".{enc}.spl" appended.

Vim will report the number of duplicate words.  This might be a mistake in the
list of words.  But sometimes it is used to have different prefixes and
suffixes for the same basic word to avoid them combining (e.g. Czech uses
this).  If you want Vim to report all duplicate words set the 'verbose'
option.

Since you might want to change a Myspell word list for use with Vim the
following procedure is recommended:

1. Obtain the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files from Myspell.
2. Make a copy of these files to xx_YY.orig.aff and xx_YY.orig.dic.
3. Change the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files to remove bad words, add missing
   words, define word characters with FOL/LOW/UPP, etc.  The distributed
   "*.diff" files can be used.
4. Start Vim with the right locale and use |:mkspell| to generate the Vim
   spell file.
5. Try out the spell file with ":set spell spelllang=xx" if you wrote it in
   a spell directory in 'runtimepath', or ":set spelllang=xx.enc.spl" if you
   wrote it somewhere else.

When the Myspell files are updated you can merge the differences:
1. Obtain the new Myspell files as xx_YY.new.aff and xx_UU.new.dic.
2. Use Vimdiff to see what changed: >
	vimdiff xx_YY.orig.dic xx_YY.new.dic
3. Take over the changes you like in xx_YY.dic.
   You may also need to change xx_YY.aff.
4. Rename xx_YY.new.dic to xx_YY.orig.dic and xx_YY.new.aff to xx_YY.new.aff.


SPELL FILE VERSIONS					*E770* *E771* *E772*

Spell checking is a relatively new feature in Vim, thus it's possible that the
.spl file format will be changed to support more languages.  Vim will check
the validity of the spell file and report anything wrong.

	E771: Old spell file, needs to be updated ~
This spell file is older than your Vim.  You need to update the .spl file.

	E772: Spell file is for newer version of Vim ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim.  You need to
update Vim.

	E770: Unsupported section in spell file ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim and contains a
section that is required for the spell file to work.  In this case it's
probably a good idea to upgrade your Vim.


SPELL FILE DUMP

If for some reason you want to check what words are supported by the currently
used spelling files, use this command:

							*:spelldump* *:spelld*
:spelld[ump]		Open a new window and fill it with all currently valid
			words.  Compound words are not included.
			Note: For some languages the result may be enormous,
			causing Vim to run out of memory.

:spelld[ump]!		Like ":spelldump" and include the word count.  This is
			the number of times the word was found while
			updating the screen.  Words that are in COMMON items
			get a starting count of 10.

The format of the word list is used |spell-wordlist-format|.  You should be
able to read it with ":mkspell" to generate one .spl file that includes all
the words.

When all entries to 'spelllang' use the same regions or no regions at all then
the region information is included in the dumped words.  Otherwise only words
for the current region are included and no "/regions" line is generated.

Comment lines with the name of the .spl file are used as a header above the
words that were generated from that .spl file.


SPELL FILE MISSING		*spell-SpellFileMissing* *spellfile.vim*

If the spell file for the language you are using is not available, you will
get an error message.  But if the "spellfile.vim" plugin is active it will
offer you to download the spell file.  Just follow the instructions, it will
ask you where to write the file (there must be a writable directory in
'runtimepath' for this).

The plugin has a default place where to look for spell files, on the Vim ftp
server.  If you want to use another location or another protocol, set the
g:spellfile_URL variable to the directory that holds the spell files.  The
|netrw| plugin is used for getting the file, look there for the specific
syntax of the URL.  Example: >
	let g:spellfile_URL = 'http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/spell'
You may need to escape special characters.

The plugin will only ask about downloading a language once.  If you want to
try again anyway restart Vim, or set g:spellfile_URL to another value (e.g.,
prepend a space).

To avoid using the "spellfile.vim" plugin do this in your vimrc file: >

	let loaded_spellfile_plugin = 1

Instead of using the plugin you can define a |SpellFileMissing| autocommand to
handle the missing file yourself.  You can use it like this: >

	:au SpellFileMissing * call Download_spell_file(expand('<amatch>'))

Thus the <amatch> item contains the name of the language.  Another important
value is 'encoding', since every encoding has its own spell file.  With two
exceptions:
- For ISO-8859-15 (latin9) the name "latin1" is used (the encodings only
  differ in characters not used in dictionary words).
- The name "ascii" may also be used for some languages where the words use
  only ASCII letters for most of the words.

The default "spellfile.vim" plugin uses this autocommand, if you define your
autocommand afterwards you may want to use ":au! SpellFileMissing" to overrule
it.  If you define your autocommand before the plugin is loaded it will notice
this and not do anything.
							*E797*
Note that the SpellFileMissing autocommand must not change or destroy the
buffer the user was editing.

==============================================================================
4. Spell file format					*spell-file-format*

This is the format of the files that are used by the person who creates and
maintains a word list.

Note that we avoid the word "dictionary" here.  That is because the goal of
spell checking differs from writing a dictionary (as in the book).  For
spelling we need a list of words that are OK, thus should not be highlighted.
Person and company names will not appear in a dictionary, but do appear in a
word list.  And some old words are rarely used while they are common
misspellings.  These do appear in a dictionary but not in a word list.

There are two formats: A straight list of words and a list using affix
compression.  The files with affix compression are used by Myspell (Mozilla
and OpenOffice.org).  This requires two files, one with .aff and one with .dic
extension.


FORMAT OF STRAIGHT WORD LIST				*spell-wordlist-format*

The words must appear one per line.  That is all that is required.

Additionally the following items are recognized:

- Empty and blank lines are ignored.

	# comment ~
- Lines starting with a # are ignored (comment lines).

	/encoding=utf-8 ~
- A line starting with "/encoding=", before any word, specifies the encoding
  of the file.  After the second '=' comes an encoding name.  This tells Vim
  to setup conversion from the specified encoding to 'encoding'.  Thus you can
  use one word list for several target encodings.

	/regions=usca ~
- A line starting with "/regions=" specifies the region names that are
  supported.  Each region name must be two ASCII letters.  The first one is
  region 1.  Thus "/regions=usca" has region 1 "us" and region 2 "ca".
  In an addition word list the region names should be equal to the main word
  list!

- Other lines starting with '/' are reserved for future use.  The ones that
  are not recognized are ignored.  You do get a warning message, so that you
  know something won't work.

- A "/" may follow the word with the following items:
    =		Case must match exactly.
    ?		Rare word.
    !		Bad (wrong) word.
    digit	A region in which the word is valid.  If no regions are
		specified the word is valid in all regions.

Example:

	# This is an example word list		comment
	/encoding=latin1			encoding of the file
	/regions=uscagb				regions "us", "ca" and "gb"
	example					word for all regions
	blah/12					word for regions "us" and "ca"
	vim/!					bad word
	Campbell/?3				rare word in region 3 "gb"
	's mornings/=				keep-case word

Note that when "/=" is used the same word with all upper-case letters is not
accepted.  This is different from a word with mixed case that is automatically
marked as keep-case, those words may appear in all upper-case letters.


FORMAT WITH .AFF AND .DIC FILES				*aff-dic-format*

There are two files: the basic word list and an affix file.  The affix file
specifies settings for the language and can contain affixes.  The affixes are
used to modify the basic words to get the full word list.  This significantly
reduces the number of words, especially for a language like Polish.  This is
called affix compression.

The basic word list and the affix file are combined with the ":mkspell"
command and results in a binary spell file.  All the preprocessing has been
done, thus this file loads fast.  The binary spell file format is described in
the source code (src/spell.c).  But only developers need to know about it.

The preprocessing also allows us to take the Myspell language files and modify
them before the Vim word list is made.  The tools for this can be found in the
"src/spell" directory.

The format for the affix and word list files is based on what Myspell uses
(the spell checker of Mozilla and OpenOffice.org).  A description can be found
here:
	http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme ~
Note that affixes are case sensitive, this isn't obvious from the description.

Vim supports quite a few extras.  They are described below |spell-affix-vim|.
Attempts have been made to keep this compatible with other spell checkers, so
that the same files can often be used.  One other project that offers more
than Myspell is Hunspell ( http://hunspell.sf.net ).


WORD LIST FORMAT				*spell-dic-format*

A short example, with line numbers:

	1	1234 ~
	2	aan ~
	3	Als ~
	4	Etten-Leur ~
	5	et al. ~
	6	's-Gravenhage ~
	7	's-Gravenhaags ~
	8	# word that differs between regions ~
	9	kado/1 ~
	10	cadeau/2 ~
	11	TCP,IP ~
	12	/the S affix may add a 's' ~
	13	bedel/S ~

The first line contains the number of words.  Vim ignores it, but you do get
an error message if it's not there.  *E760*

What follows is one word per line.  White space at the end of the line is
ignored, all other white space matters.  The encoding is specified in the
affix file |spell-SET|.

Comment lines start with '#' or '/'.  See the example lines 8 and 12.  Note
that putting a comment after a word is NOT allowed:

		someword   # comment that causes an error! ~

After the word there is an optional slash and flags.  Most of these flags are
letters that indicate the affixes that can be used with this word.  These are
specified with SFX and PFX lines in the .aff file, see |spell-SFX| and
|spell-PFX|.  Vim allows using other flag types with the FLAG item in the
affix file |spell-FLAG|.

When the word only has lower-case letters it will also match with the word
starting with an upper-case letter.

When the word includes an upper-case letter, this means the upper-case letter
is required at this position.  The same word with a lower-case letter at this
position will not match. When some of the other letters are upper-case it will
not match either.

The word with all upper-case characters will always be OK,

	word list	matches			does not match ~
	als		als Als ALS		ALs AlS aLs aLS
	Als		Als  ALS		als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	ALS		ALS			als Als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	AlS		AlS ALS			als Als ALs aLs aLS

The KEEPCASE affix ID can be used to specifically match a word with identical
case only, see below |spell-KEEPCASE|.

Note: in line 5 to 7 non-word characters are used.  You can include any
character in a word.  When checking the text a word still only matches when it
appears with a non-word character before and after it.  For Myspell a word
starting with a non-word character probably won't work.

In line 12 the word "TCP/IP" is defined.  Since the slash has a special
meaning the comma is used instead.  This is defined with the SLASH item in the
affix file, see |spell-SLASH|.  Note that without this SLASH item the word
will be "TCP,IP".


AFFIX FILE FORMAT			*spell-aff-format* *spell-affix-vim*

							*spell-affix-comment*
Comment lines in the .aff file start with a '#':

	# comment line ~

Items with a fixed number of arguments can be followed by a comment.  But only
if none of the arguments can contain white space.  The comment must start with
a "#" character.  Example:

	KEEPCASE =  # fix case for words with this flag ~


ENCODING							*spell-SET*

The affix file can be in any encoding that is supported by "iconv".  However,
in some cases the current locale should also be set properly at the time
|:mkspell| is invoked.  Adding FOL/LOW/UPP lines removes this requirement
|spell-FOL|.

The encoding should be specified before anything where the encoding matters.
The encoding applies both to the affix file and the dictionary file.  It is
done with a SET line:

	SET utf-8 ~

The encoding can be different from the value of the 'encoding' option at the
time ":mkspell" is used.  Vim will then convert everything to 'encoding' and
generate a spell file for 'encoding'.  If some of the used characters to not
fit in 'encoding' you will get an error message.
							*spell-affix-mbyte*
When using a multi-byte encoding it's possible to use more different affix
flags.  But Myspell doesn't support that, thus you may not want to use it
anyway.  For compatibility use an 8-bit encoding.


INFORMATION

These entries in the affix file can be used to add information to the spell
file.  There are no restrictions on the format, but they should be in the
right encoding.

				*spell-NAME* *spell-VERSION* *spell-HOME*
				*spell-AUTHOR* *spell-EMAIL* *spell-COPYRIGHT*
	NAME		Name of the language
	VERSION		1.0.1  with fixes
	HOME		http://www.myhome.eu
	AUTHOR		John Doe
	EMAIL		john AT Doe DOT net
	COPYRIGHT	LGPL

These fields are put in the .spl file as-is.  The |:spellinfo| command can be
used to view the info.

							*:spellinfo* *:spelli*
:spelli[nfo]		Display the information for the spell file(s) used for
			the current buffer.


CHARACTER TABLES
							*spell-affix-chars*
When using an 8-bit encoding the affix file should define what characters are
word characters.  This is because the system where ":mkspell" is used may not
support a locale with this encoding and isalpha() won't work.  For example
when using "cp1250" on Unix.
						*E761* *E762* *spell-FOL*
						*spell-LOW* *spell-UPP*
Three lines in the affix file are needed.  Simplistic example:

	FOL   ~
	LOW   ~
	UPP   ~

All three lines must have exactly the same number of characters.

The "FOL" line specifies the case-folded characters.  These are used to
compare words while ignoring case.  For most encodings this is identical to
the lower case line.

The "LOW" line specifies the characters in lower-case.  Mostly it's equal to
the "FOL" line.

The "UPP" line specifies the characters with upper-case.  That is, a character
is upper-case where it's different from the character at the same position in
"FOL".

An exception is made for the German sharp s .  The upper-case version is
"SS".  In the FOL/LOW/UPP lines it should be included, so that it's recognized
as a word character, but use the  character in all three.

ASCII characters should be omitted, Vim always handles these in the same way.
When the encoding is UTF-8 no word characters need to be specified.

							*E763*
Vim allows you to use spell checking for several languages in the same file.
You can list them in the 'spelllang' option.  As a consequence all spell files
for the same encoding must use the same word characters, otherwise they can't
be combined without errors.

If you get an E763 warning that the word tables differ you need to update your
".spl" spell files.  If you downloaded the files, get the latest version of
all spell files you use.  If you are only using one, e.g., German, then also
download the recent English spell files.  Otherwise generate the .spl file
again with |:mkspell|.  If you still get errors check the FOL, LOW and UPP
lines in the used .aff files.

The XX.ascii.spl spell file generated with the "-ascii" argument will not
contain the table with characters, so that it can be combine with spell files
for any encoding.  The .add.spl files also do not contain the table.


MID-WORD CHARACTERS
							*spell-midword*
Some characters are only to be considered word characters if they are used in
between two ordinary word characters.  An example is the single quote: It is
often used to put text in quotes, thus it can't be recognized as a word
character, but when it appears in between word characters it must be part of
the word.  This is needed to detect a spelling error such as they'are.  That
should be they're, but since "they" and "are" are words themselves that would
go unnoticed.

These characters are defined with MIDWORD in the .aff file.  Example:

	MIDWORD	'- ~


FLAG TYPES						*spell-FLAG*

Flags are used to specify the affixes that can be used with a word and for
other properties of the word.  Normally single-character flags are used.  This
limits the number of possible flags, especially for 8-bit encodings.  The FLAG
item can be used if more affixes are to be used.  Possible values:

	FLAG long	use two-character flags
	FLAG num	use numbers, from 1 up to 65000
	FLAG caplong	use one-character flags without A-Z and two-character
			flags that start with A-Z

With "FLAG num" the numbers in a list of affixes need to be separated with a
comma: "234,2143,1435".  This method is inefficient, but useful if the file is
generated with a program.

When using "caplong" the two-character flags all start with a capital: "Aa",
"B1", "BB", etc.  This is useful to use one-character flags for the most
common items and two-character flags for uncommon items.

Note: When using utf-8 only characters up to 65000 may be used for flags.

Note: even when using "num" or "long" the number of flags available to
compounding and prefixes is limited to about 250.


AFFIXES
					    *spell-PFX* *spell-SFX*
The usual PFX (prefix) and SFX (suffix) lines are supported (see the Myspell
documentation or the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Affix-Compression.html).

Summary:
	SFX L Y 2 ~
	SFX L 0 re [^x] ~
	SFX L 0 ro x ~

The first line is a header and has four fields:
	SFX {flag} {combine} {count}

{flag}		The name used for the suffix.  Mostly it's a single letter,
		but other characters can be used, see |spell-FLAG|.

{combine}	Can be 'Y' or 'N'.  When 'Y' then the word plus suffix can
		also have a prefix.  When 'N' then a prefix is not allowed.

{count}		The number of lines following.  If this is wrong you will get
		an error message.

For PFX the fields are exactly the same.

The basic format for the following lines is:
	SFX {flag} {strip} {add} {condition} {extra}

{flag}		Must be the same as the {flag} used in the first line.

{strip}		Characters removed from the basic word.  There is no check if
		the characters are actually there, only the length is used (in
		bytes).  This better match the {condition}, otherwise strange
		things may happen.  If the {strip} length is equal to or
		longer than the basic word the suffix won't be used.
		When {strip} is 0 (zero) then nothing is stripped.

{add}		Characters added to the basic word, after removing {strip}.
		Optionally there is a '/' followed by flags.  The flags apply
		to the word plus affix.  See |spell-affix-flags|

{condition}	A simplistic pattern.  Only when this matches with a basic
		word will the suffix be used for that word.  This is normally
		for using one suffix letter with different {add} and {strip}
		fields for words with different endings.
		When {condition} is a . (dot) there is no condition.
		The pattern may contain:
		- Literal characters.
		- A set of characters in []. [abc] matches a, b and c.
		  A dash is allowed for a range [a-c], but this is
		  Vim-specific.
		- A set of characters that starts with a ^, meaning the
		  complement of the specified characters. [^abc] matches any
		  character but a, b and c.

{extra}		Optional extra text:
		    # comment		Comment is ignored
		    -			Hunspell uses this, ignored

For PFX the fields are the same, but the {strip}, {add} and {condition} apply
to the start of the word.

Note: Myspell ignores any extra text after the relevant info.  Vim requires
this text to start with a "#" so that mistakes don't go unnoticed.  Example:

	SFX F 0 in   [^i]n      # Spion > Spionin  ~
	SFX F 0 nen  in		# Bauerin > Bauerinnen ~

However, to avoid lots of errors in affix files written for Myspell, you can
add the IGNOREEXTRA flag.

Apparently Myspell allows an affix name to appear more than once.  Since this
might also be a mistake, Vim checks for an extra "S".  The affix files for
Myspell that use this feature apparently have this flag.  Example:

	SFX a Y 1 S ~
	SFX a 0 an . ~

	SFX a Y 2 S ~
	SFX a 0 en . ~
	SFX a 0 on . ~


AFFIX FLAGS						*spell-affix-flags*

This is a feature that comes from Hunspell: The affix may specify flags.  This
works similar to flags specified on a basic word.  The flags apply to the
basic word plus the affix (but there are restrictions).  Example:

	SFX S Y 1 ~
	SFX S 0 s . ~

	SFX A Y 1 ~
	SFX A 0 able/S . ~

When the dictionary file contains "drink/AS" then these words are possible:

	drink
	drinks		uses S suffix
	drinkable	uses A suffix
	drinkables	uses A suffix and then S suffix

Generally the flags of the suffix are added to the flags of the basic word,
both are used for the word plus suffix.  But the flags of the basic word are
only used once for affixes, except that both one prefix and one suffix can be
used when both support combining.

Specifically, the affix flags can be used for:
- Suffixes on suffixes, as in the example above.  This works once, thus you
  can have two suffixes on a word (plus one prefix).
- Making the word with the affix rare, by using the |spell-RARE| flag.
- Exclude the word with the affix from compounding, by using the
  |spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag.
- Allow the word with the affix to be part of a compound word on the side of
  the affix with the |spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.
- Use the NEEDCOMPOUND flag: word plus affix can only be used as part of a
  compound word. |spell-NEEDCOMPOUND|
- Compound flags: word plus
