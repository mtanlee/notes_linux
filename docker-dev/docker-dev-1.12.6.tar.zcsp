 system does not natively support
extended attributes.
Older implementations tended to flood the vnode and name caches with
prefetched entries which may not be referenced.  The current implementation
avoids creating those entries until they are referenced.  Try this
option and see whether performance improves or degrades. Probably most
useful for client to server network interconnects with a large bandwidth
times delay product.
.Pp
.It Cm acregmin Ns = Ns Aq Ar seconds
.It Cm acregmax Ns = Ns Aq Ar seconds
.It Cm acdirmin Ns = Ns Aq Ar seconds
.It Cm acdirmax Ns = Ns Aq Ar seconds
These options set the minimum and maximum attribute cache timeouts for
directories and "regular" (non-directory) files.  The default minimum
is 5 seconds and the default maximum is 60 seconds.  Setting both the
minimum and maximum to zero will disable attribute caching.  The algorithm
to calculate the timeout is based on the age of the file or directory.
The older it is, the longer the attribute cache is considered valid,
subject to the limits above.  Note that the effectiveness of this
algorithm depends on how well the clocks on the client and server are
synchronized.
.Pp
.It Cm actimeo Ns = Ns Aq Ar seconds
Set all attribute cache timeouts to the same value.
.Pp
.It Cm noac
Disable attribute caching.  Equivalent to setting
.Cm actimeo
to 0.
.Pp
.It Cm nonegnamecache
Disable negative name caching.
.Pp
.It Cm locallocks
Perform all file locking operations locally on the NFS client (in the VFS
layer) instead of on the NFS server.  This option can provide file locking
support on an NFS file system for which the server does not support file locking.
However, because the file locking is only performed on the client, the
NFS server and other NFS clients will have no knowledge of the locks.
Note: mounts which are both soft and read-only will also have the
.Cm locallocks
mount option enabled by default - unless explicitly overridden with a
lock option (for example,
.Cm nolocks
or
.Cm nolocallocks
).
.Pp
.It Cm nolocks
.It Cm nolockd
.It Cm nolock
.It Cm nonlm
Do not support NFS file locking operations.  Any attempt to perform file
locking operations on this mount will return the error
.Er ENOTSUP
regardless of whether or not the NFS server supports NFS file locking.
.Pp
.It Cm noquota
Do not support file system quota operations that would normally be
serviced by using the RQUOTA protocol.  Any attempt to perform quota
operations on this mount will return the error
.Er ENOTSUP
regardless of whether or not the NFS server supports the RQUOTA service.
.Pp
.It Cm maxgroups Ns = Ns Aq Ar num
Set the maximum size of the group list for the credentials to the specified
value.  This should be used for mounts on old servers that cannot handle
a group list size of 16, as specified in RFC 1057.  Try 8, if users in
a lot of groups cannot get a response from the mount point.
.Pp
.It Cm dumbtimer
Turn off the dynamic retransmit timeout estimator.
This may be useful for UDP mounts that exhibit high retry rates, since it
is possible that the dynamically estimated timeout interval is too short.
.Pp
.It Cm timeo Ns = Ns Aq Ar timeout
Set the initial retransmit timeout to the specified value.
The default is 1 second.
May be useful for fine tuning UDP mounts over internetworks
with high packet loss rates or an overloaded server.
Try increasing the interval if
.Xr nfsstat 1
shows high retransmit rates while the file system is active or reducing the
value if there is a low retransmit rate but long response delay observed.
(Normally, the
.Cm dumbtimer
option should be specified when using this option to manually
tune the timeout interval.)
.Pp
.It Cm retrans Ns = Ns Aq Ar count
Set the retransmit timeout count for soft mounts to the specified value.
The default value is 10.
.Pp
.It Cm deadtimeout Ns = Ns Aq Ar timeout
If the mount is still unresponsive
.Ar timeout
seconds after it is initially reported unresponsive, then mark the
mount as dead so that it will be forcibly unmounted.
Note: mounts which are both soft and read-only will also have the
.Cm deadtimeout
mount option set to 60 seconds.  This can be explicitly overridden by setting 
.Cm deadtimeout Ns = Ns 0 .
.Pp
.It Cm mutejukebox
When NFS requests repeatedly get jukebox errors (NFS3ERR_JUKEBOX,
NFS4ERR_DELAY) from the server the NFS file system is reported as being
unresponsive.  Use of this option will prevent the file system from
being included in the list of unresponsive file systems that would be
included in a dialog presented to the user.  This option may be useful
when a file system is expected to get such errors during normal
operation.  For example, when it's backed by a hierarchical storage
management system.
.Pp
.It Cm async
Assume that unstable write requests have actually been committed
to stable storage on the server, and thus will not require resending
in the event that the server crashes.  Use of this option may improve
performance but only at the risk of data loss if the server crashes.
Note: this mount option will only be honored if the
.Cm nfs.client.allow_async
option in
.Xr nfs.conf 5
is also enabled.
.Pp
.It Cm sync
Perform I/O requests (specifically, write requests) synchronously.
The operation will not return until a response is received from the
server.  (The default,
.Cm nosync ,
behavior is to return once the I/O has been queued up.)
.Pp
.It Cm nocallback
For NFSv4 mounts, don't support callback requests from the server.
This should effectively disable features that require callback requests
such as delegations.
.Pp
.It Cm nonamedattr
For NFSv4 mounts, don't support named attributes even if the server does.
By default, if the server appears to support named attributes, they
will be used to store extended attributes and named streams (e.g. FinderInfo
and resource forks).
.Pp
.It Cm noacl
For NFSv4 mounts, don't support ACLs even if the server does.
ACLs are currently disabled by default to avoid issues with the way
ACLs and modes are handled differently on other operating systems.
This may be overriden by specifying the
.Cm acl
option.
.Pp
.It Cm aclonly
For NFSv4 mounts, only support ACLs; do not support the mode attribute.
(Any mode attribute values returned will have all permission bits set -
regardless of the value of any ACL or access mode stored in the file
system.)  This option overrides the
.Cm noacl
option.
.Pp
.It Cm nfc
Convert name strings to Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) when sending
them to the NFS server.  This option may be used to improve interoperability
with NFS clients and servers that typically use names in the NFC form.
.El
.Pp
.Xr nfs.conf 5
can be used to configure some NFS client options.  In particular,
.Cm nfs.client.mount.options
can be used to specify default mount options.  This can be useful in
situations where it is not easy to configure the command-line options.
Some NFS client options in
.Xr nfs.conf 5
correspond to kernel configuration values which will get set by
.Nm
when performing a mount.  To update these values without performing a
mount, use the command:
.Nm
.Cm configupdate .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The following
.Nm
command line flags have equivalent
.Fl o Ar option
forms (shown in parentheses) and their use is strongly discouraged.
These command line flags are deprecated and the
.Fl o Ar option
forms should be used instead.
.Pp

.Fl 3
(vers=3),
.Fl 4
(vers=4),
.Fl L

.Sh EXAMPLES
The simplest way to invoke
.Nm
is with a command like:
.Pp
.D1 Ic mount remotehost:/filesystem /localmountpoint
.Pp
or:
.Pp
.D1 Ic mount -t nfs remotehost:/filesystem /localmountpoint
.Sh PERFORMANCE
As can be derived from the comments accompanying the options, performance
tuning of
.Tn NFS
can be a non-trivial task.
Here are some common points
to watch:
.Bl -bullet -width indent
.It
Use of the
.Cm sync
option will probably have a detrimental affect on performance.
Its use is discouraged as it provides little benefit.
.It
Use of the
.Cm async
option may improve performance, but only at the risk of losing data
if the server crashes because the client will not be making sure that
all data is committed to stable storage on the server.
.It
Increasing the read and write size with the
.Cm rsize
and
.Cm wsize
options respectively will increase throughput if the network
interface can handle the larger packet sizes.
.Pp
The default read and write sizes are 8K when using
.Tn UDP ,
and 32K when using
.Tn TCP .
Values over 16K are only supported for
.Tn TCP ,
where 64K is the maximum.
.Pp
Any value over 32K is unlikely to get you more performance, unless
you have a very fast network.
.It
If the network interface cannot handle larger packet sizes or a
long train of back to back packets, you may see low performance
figures or even temporary hangups during
.Tn NFS
activity.
.Pp
This can especially happen with lossy network connections
(e.g. wireless networks) which can lead to a lot of dropped packets.
.Pp
In this case, decreasing the read and write size, using
.Tn TCP ,
or a combination of both will usually lead to better throughput.
.It
For connections that are not on the same
.Tn LAN ,
and/or may experience packet loss, using
.Tn TCP
is strongly recommended.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
Some common problems with
.Nm
can be difficult for first time users to understand.
.Pp
.Dl "mount_nfs: can't access /foo: Permission denied
.Pp
This message means that the remote host is either not exporting
the file system you requested or is not exporting it to your host.
If you believe the remote host is indeed exporting a file system to you,
make sure the
.Xr exports 5
file is exporting the proper directories.
The program
.Xr showmount 8
can be used to see a server's exports list.
The command
.Dq "showmount -e remotehostname"
will display what file systems the remote host is exporting.
.Pp
A common mistake is that
.Xr mountd 8
will not export a file system with the
.Fl alldirs
option, unless it
is a mount point on the exporting host.
It is not possible to remotely
mount a subdirectory of an exported mount, unless it is exported with the
.Fl alldirs
option.
.Pp
The following error:
.Pp
.Dl "NFS Portmap: RPC: Program not registered
.Pp
means that the remote host is not running
.Xr nfsd 8 .
or
.Xr mountd 8 .
The program
.Xr rpcinfo 8
can be used to determine if the remote host is running nfsd and mountd by issuing
the command:
.Pp
.Dl rpcinfo -p remotehostname
.Pp
If the remote host is running nfsd, mountd, rpc.statd,
and rpc.lockd it would display:
.Pp
.Dl "program vers proto   port
.Dl " 100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper

.Dl " 100021    4   tcp    917  nlockmgr
.Pp
The error:
.Pp
.Dl "mount_nfs: can't resolve host
.Pp
indicates that
.Nm
could not resolve the name of the remote host.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar special 
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_ntfs
command attaches the NTFS file system residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an NTFS file system on any
directory that they own (provided, of course, that they have appropriate
access to the device that contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s
Mount the volume using case sensitive semantics.  This means that you can create files that have names that only differ in case such as for example "foo" and "Foo".  Without this option the volume is mounted using case insensitive semantics in which case if you create a file with name "foo" you then cannot create a file named "Foo" or rather if you do create a file named "Foo" it would overwrite the existing file "foo".
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command mounts a share from a remote server using SMB/CIFS protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Do not ask for a password.
At run time,
.Nm
reads the
.Pa ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf
file for additional configuration parameters and a password.
If no password is found,
.Nm
prompts for it.
.It Fl o 
Options passed to 
.Xr mount 2
are specified with the 
.Fl o 
option followed by a comma separated string of options. See the 
.Xr mount 8 
man page for possible options and their meanings. Additional options supported 
by the mount_smbfs are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It nobrowse
Indicate to the Carbon subsystem that this volume is not to be displayed 
to the user.
.It automounted
Set flags on the mountpoint to indicate that the volume has been mounted 
by the automounter.
.It nostreams
Don't use NTFS Streams even if they are supported by the server.
.It soft
Make the mount soft.  Fail file system calls after a number of seconds.
.It nonotification
Turn off using notifications for this volume.
.El
.It Fl f Ar mode , Fl d Ar mode
Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and directories.
The values must be specified as octal numbers.
Default value for the file mode
is taken from mount point, default value for the directory mode adds execute
permission where the file mode gives read permission.
.Pp
Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by SMB
server. 
.It Fl h
Prints a help message, much like the SYNOPSIS above.
.It Fl s
Force a new session to be created to the server.
.It Fl v
Prints version.
.\" //[domain;][user[:password]@]server[/share]
.It Xo
.Pf // Oo Ar domain ;
.Oc Ns Oo Ar user Ns Oo
.Pf \: Ar password
.Oc Ns @ Ns Oc Ar server Ns Oo
.Pf / Ar share
.Oc
.Xc
The
.Nm
command will use
.Ar server
as the NetBIOS name of remote computer,
.Ar user
as the remote user name and
.Ar share
as the resource name on a remote server.
.Ar Domain
and/or
.Ar password
may be specified here.  If
.Ar user
is omitted the logged in user id will be used.  Omitting
.Ar share
is an error when
.Nm
is run from the command line, otherwise a browsing dialogue is presented.
.It Ar path
Path to mount point.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa nsmb.conf" -compact
.It Pa nsmb.conf
Keeps static parameters for connections and other information.
See
.Pa man nsmb.conf
for details.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from
the SMB server myserver :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir /smb/public
mount -t smbfs //username:userpass@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public

.Ed
This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from
the SMB server myserver as guest:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir /smb/public
mount -t smbfs //guest:@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public
.Ed
\fBNote:\fP You should always use the system mount command and never call mount_smbfs directly.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_udf
.Nd mount a UDF filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_udf
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl s Ar sessionStart
.Op Fl n Ar lastRecordedLBA
.Op Fl b Ar blockSize
.Op Fl p Ar packetSizeInBlocks
.Op Fl v Ar verificationPolicy
.Op Fl w
.Ar devicePath mountPath
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_udf
command attaches the UDF filesystem residing on the device
.Pa devicePath
to the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa mountPath .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.It Fl v Ar verificationPolicy
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  It controlls the verification policy when writing to RW type optical media.  Its value can be "meta", "all", or "none".  Policy "meta" means only the metadata are verified after they are written.  This is the default policy.  Policy "all" means to verify data written, which could be several times slower than policy "meta".  Policy "none" does not verify any data.  It is only slightly faster than "meta" in normal cases, but may result a corrupted UDF disc if the write of metadata fails.
.It Fl s Ar sessionStart
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  When manually mounting a UDF volume with Virtual Partition, it specifies the start Logical Block Address of the last session where UDF data structures (VRS and AVDP) resides.  This value overrides the value obtained from the device.
.It Fl n Ar lastRecordedLBA
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  When manually mounting a UDF volume with Virtual Partition, it specifies the last recorded Logical Block Address where the UDF VAT ICB will be searched.  This value overrides the value obtained from the device.
.It Fl b Ar blockSize
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  It specifies the block size in bytes used when mounting the UDF volume.  This value overrides the value obtained from the device.
.It Fl p Ar packetSizeInBlocks
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  It specifies the packet size in blocks when manually mounting the UDF volume.  This value overrides the value obtained from the device.
.It Fl w
This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  It forces to enable the experimental packet writing function on optical media that has not been fully supported, such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, HD DVD-R, and BD-R.  Writing to these media does not work on some drives and may cause data corruption or data loss on some other drives.  Therefore, this flag should be used only by file system developers when debugging the experimental write functions.
.El
.Pp
The 
.Fl s ,
.Fl n ,
.Fl b ,
and
.Fl p
flags are not useful in normal use.  They are mainly used for debugging and data recovery.  Since the
.Fl s ,
.Fl n ,
and
.Fl p
flags are all specified in units of block size, when any of these flags are specified, it is strongly recommended that the
.Fl b
flag is also specified.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh BUGS
Reading of all UDF revisions (1.02 - 2.60) on both block device (e.g., hard drives and USB drives) and most optical media is supported.  Writing to block devices, DVD-RW and DVD+RW is supported with the following exceptions: (1) Cannot write Finder Info, Resource Fork, or other extended attributes in UDF volumes of revision 1.02 and 1.50; (2) Cannot write to mirrored metadata partition.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_udf
utility first appeared in Mac OS X.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command mounts the WebDAV-enabled server directory at
.Ar [scheme://]host[:port][/path]
at the mount point indicated by
.Ar node .
.Pp
The user and group IDs for all files and directories are set to unknown,
and the permissions default to read, write and execute for user, group
and other.
.Pp
The arguments and options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s
Require that authentication credentials be sent securely to the server.
Note: If this option is not set, sending authentication credentials insecurely
to the server will be allowed but will be logged.
.It Fl S
Suppresses all user interface including the authentication dialogs and the
non-responsive ("disconnect") server dialogs. If the server connection becomes
non-responsive, the file system is immediately unmounted when this option has
been used.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode, you are prompted for the username and password.
.It Fl o
Options passed to
.Xr mount 2
are specified with the
.Fl o
option followed by a comma-separated string of options. See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings. If connecting to a
Class 1 compliant WebDAV server, the rdonly option will be set even if
it was not specified because mount_webdav will not allow files to be
opened with write access on servers which do not support the DAV LOCK
method.
.It Fl v Ar volume_name
Allows the volume_name attribute (ATTR_VOL_NAME) returned by
.Xr getattrlist 2
to be specified. If the volume_name is not specified, the last path
component name of the
.Ar node
path is used as the volume_name.
.It Ar [scheme://]host[:port][/path]
The WebDAV-enabled server directory (collection resource) to mount as a volume.
The scheme, if specified, must be "http://" or "https://". If the scheme is not
specified, then "http://" is used.
If the port is not specified, then port 80 is used when the scheme is "http://" or
port 443 is used when the scheme is "https://".
If the path is not specified, then the path "/" is used.
.It Ar node
Path to mount point. Note: The mount point directory must be created or exist before issuing the
.Nm
command.

.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
Obsolete.  See
.Xr nfsd 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon was formerly the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from NFS clients.
This functionality has been moved into the NFS server daemon
.Xr nfsd 8 .
.Pp
Please refer to
.Xr nfsd 8
for NFS server documenation.
.Pp
The following is a list of former
.Nm
options that are now available as
.Xr nfsd 8
options:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy mountd option" ".Sy new nfsd option" ".Sy Description"
.It Sy mountd option Ta Sy nfsd option Ta Sy Description
.It Fl n Ta Fl N Ta allow non-root mounts
.It Fl r Ta Fl R Ta allow regular file mounts
.It Pa exportsfile Ta Fl F Pa exportsfile Ta alternate exports file
.El
.Pp
However, such configuration options are normally specified via
.Xr nfs.conf 5 .
.Pp
When the NFS server is started, it loads the export host addresses and
options into the kernel using the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call.  After changing the list of exports (either directly or
indirectly via a change in netgroup membership), the administrator
should send a hangup signal to the nfsd daemon to get it to reload
the export information:
.Pp
.Dl "kill \-s HUP `cat /var/run/nfsd.pid`
.Pp
For backwards compatibility, the following should also work:
.Pp
.Dl "kill \-s HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`
.Pp
Any errors encountered while processing the export entries will
be logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh FILES

.El
.Pp
.Ar mountflags 
above are either:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
.Ar removable 
or
.Ar fixed
.It
.Ar readonly
or
.Ar writeable  
.It
.Ar suid
or
.Ar nosuid  
.It
.Ar dev
or
.Ar nodev
.El
.Pp
FAT volumes do not actually have a volume UUID.
They have an optional 4-byte volume ID.
If a volume has an ID, then it will be converted to a version 3 UUID
using MD5 to checksum the kFSUUIDNamespaceSHA1 UUID folowed by the volume ID.
.Pp
For the
.Fl k
option, if the volume has a volume ID, the exit status will be 253 and the UUID
will be printed to standard out, without any trailing newline.
Otherwise, if the volume appears to be FAT, the exit status will be 255.
If the volume does not appear to be FAT, the exit status will be 254.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mtree
utility compares the file hierarchy rooted in the current directory against a
specification read from the standard input.
Messages are written to the standard output for any files whose
characteristics do not match the specifications, or which are
missing from either the file hierarchy or the specification.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.\" ==========
.It Fl c
Print a specification for the file hierarchy to the standard output.
.\" ==========
.It Fl d
Ignore everything except directory type files.
.\" ==========
.It Fl e
Do not complain about files that are in the file hierarchy, but not in the
specification.
.\" ==========
.It Fl f Ar file
Read the specification from
.Ar file ,
instead of from the standard input.
.Pp
If this option is specified twice,
the two specifications are compared with each other,
rather than to the file hierarchy.
The specifications be sorted like output generated using
.Fl c .
The output format in this case is somewhat remniscent of
.Xr comm 1 ,
having "in first spec only", "in second spec only", and "different"
columns, prefixed by zero, one and two TAB characters respectively.
Each entry in the "different" column occupies two lines,
one from each specification.
.\" ==========
.It Fl i
Indent the output 4 spaces each time a directory level is descended when
create a specification with the
.Fl c
option.
This does not affect either the /set statements or the comment before each
directory.
It does however affect the comment before the close of each directory.
.\" ==========
.It Fl K Ar keywords
Add the specified (whitespace or comma separated)
.Ar keywords
to the current set of keywords.
.\" ==========
.It Fl k Ar keywords
Use the ``type'' keyword plus the specified (whitespace or comma separated)
.Ar keywords
instead of the current set of keywords.
.\" ==========
.It Fl L
Follow all symbolic links in the file hierarchy.
.\" ==========
.It Fl n
Do not emit pathname comments when creating a specification.
Normally
a comment is emitted before each directory and before the close of that
directory when using the
.Fl c
option.
.\" ==========
.It Fl P
Do not follow symbolic links in the file hierarchy, instead consider
the symbolic link itself in any comparisons.
This is the default.
.\" ==========
.It Fl p Ar path
Use the file hierarchy rooted in
.Ar path ,
instead of the current directory.
.\" ==========
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Do not complain when a
.Dq missing
directory cannot be created because it already exists.
This occurs when the directory is a symbolic link.
.\" ==========
.It Fl r
Remove any files in the file hierarchy that are not described in the
specification.
.\" ==========
.It Fl s Ar seed
Display a single checksum to the standard error output that represents all
of the files for which the keyword
.Cm cksum
was specified.
The checksum is seeded with the specified value.
.\" ==========
.It Fl U
Modify the owner, group, permissions, and modification time of existing
files to match the specification and create any missing directories or
symbolic links.
User, group and permissions must all be specified for missing directories
to be created.
Corrected mismatches are not considered errors.
.\" ==========
.It Fl u
Same as
.Fl U
except a status of 2 is returned if the file hierarchy did not match
the specification.
.\" ==========
.It Fl w
Make some error conditions non-fatal warnings.
.\" ==========
.It Fl X Ar exclude-list
The specified file contains
.Xr fnmatch 3
patterns matching files to be excluded from
the specification, one to a line.
If the pattern contains a
.Ql \&/
character, it will be matched against entire pathnames (relative to
the starting directory); otherwise,
it will be matched against basenames only.
No comments are allowed in
the
.Ar exclude-list
file.
.\" ==========
.It Fl x
Do not descend below mount points in the file hierarchy.
.El
.Pp
Specifications are mostly composed of ``keywords'', i.e., strings
that specify values relating to files.
No keywords have default values, and if a keyword has no value set, no
checks based on it are performed.
.Pp
Currently supported keywords are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Cm
.It Cm cksum
The checksum of the file using the default algorithm specified by
the
.Xr cksum 1
utility.
.It Cm flags
The file flags as a symbolic name.
See
.Xr chflags 1
for information on these names.
If no flags are to be set the string
.Dq none
may be used to override the current default.
.It Cm ignore
Ignore any file hierarchy below this file.
.It Cm gid
The file group as a numeric value.
.It Cm gname
The file group as a symbolic name.
.It Cm md5digest
The MD5 message digest of the file.
.It Cm sha1digest
The
.Tn FIPS
160-1
.Pq Dq Tn SHA-1
message digest of the file.
.It Cm ripemd160digest
The
.Tn RIPEMD160
message digest of the file.
.It Cm mode
The current file's permissions as a numeric (octal) or symbolic
value.
.It Cm nlink
The number of hard links the file is expected to have.
.It Cm nochange
Make sure this file or directory exists but otherwise ignore all attributes.
.It Cm uid
The file owner as a numeric value.
.It Cm uname
The file owner as a symbolic name.
.It Cm size
The size, in bytes, of the file.
.It Cm link
The file the symbolic link is expected to reference.
.It Cm time
The last modification time of the file.
.It Cm type
The type of the file; may be set to any one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Cm -compact
.It Cm block
block special device
.It Cm char
character special device
.It Cm dir
directory
.It Cm fifo
fifo
.It Cm file
regular file
.It Cm link
symbolic link
.It Cm socket
socket
.El
.El
.Pp
The default set of keywords are
.Cm flags ,
.Cm gid ,
.Cm mode ,
.Cm nlink ,
.Cm size ,
.Cm link ,
.Cm time ,
and
.Cm uid .
.Pp
There are four types of lines in a specification.
.Pp
The first type of line sets a global value for a keyword, and consists of
the string ``/set'' followed by whitespace, followed by sets of keyword/value
pairs, separated by whitespace.
Keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an equals sign
(``=''), followed by a value, without whitespace characters.
Once a keyword has been set, its value remains unchanged until either
reset or unset.
.Pp
The second type of line unsets keywords and consists of the string
``/unset'', followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords,
separated by whitespace.
.Pp
The third type of line is a file specification and consists of a file
name, followed by whitespace, followed by zero or more whitespace
separated keyword/value pairs.
The file name may be preceded by whitespace characters.
The file name may contain any of the standard file name matching
characters (``['', ``]'', ``?'' or ``*''), in which case files
in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pattern that
they match.
.Pp
Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
equals sign (``=''), followed by the keyword's value, without
whitespace characters.
These values override, without changing, the global value of the
corresponding keyword.
.Pp
All paths are relative.
Specifying a directory will cause subsequent files to be searched
for in that directory hierarchy.
Which brings us to the last type of line in a specification: a line
containing only the string
.Dq Pa ..\&
causes the current directory
path to ascend one level.
.Pp
Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash
mark (``#'') are ignored.
.Pp
The
.Nm mtree
utility exits with a status of 0 on success, 1 if any error occurred,
and 2 if the file hierarchy did not match the specification.
A status of 2 is converted to a status of 0 if the
.Fl U
option is used.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The

options can be used in combination to create directory hierarchies
for distributions and other such things; the files in

were used to create almost all directories in this
.Fx
distribution.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mtree
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
The
.Tn MD5
digest capability was added in
.Fx 2.1 ,
in response to the widespread use of programs which can spoof
.Xr cksum 1 .
The
.Tn SHA-1
and
.Tn RIPEMD160
digests were added in
.Fx 4.0 ,
as new attacks have demonstrated weaknesses in
.Tn MD5 .
Support for file flags was added in
.Fx 4.0 ,
and mostly comes from
.Nx .

.Sh NAME
.Nm nbdst
.Nd NetBoot deferred shadow tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nbdst
.Op Fl recycle | Fl preallocate Ar size
.Ar devnode
.Ar shadowfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used during NetBoot to associate a shadow file with the disk
image being used as the root device. After the shadow file
is attached, subsequent writes to the root device will be
redirected to the shadow file, which normally resides on local
storage.
.Nm
is invoked by /etc/rc.netboot
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Pp
The following arguments must be specified:
.Bl -tag -width "devnode012345" -compact
.It Ar devnode
The device node of the root device, in the form
.Qo disk0 Qc
.It Ar shadowfile
Path to a shadow file which will be created and associated
with the NetBoot root device
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "recycle "
.It Fl recycle
If a shadow file already exists, reset it and use it again.  Otherwise,
information written to an existing shadow file will reappear.  Reusing
a previous shadow file without resetting it requires that the shadow file
be created with the same base image.
.It Fl preallocate Ar size
Set the shadow file to the given size up front.  This forces a reset of
the shadow file (like
.Fl recycle Ns ")."
.El
.Sh NOTE
.Nm
can only be run as root.

.Sh NAME
.Nm networkd
.Nd network daemon.
.\" 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a launch-on-demand daemon that performs operations on behalf of code in
libystem_network, a component of libSystem.
.Pp
.Nm
has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users should not run
.Nm
manually.
.Pp
.Ss LOGGING
There are several methods with which to examine 
.Nm Ns 's internal state for debugging and diagnostic purposes. The syslog(1)
logging levels map as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Error - Error messages
.Dl Warning - Non-fatal concerns
.Dl Notice - Internal state messages
.Dl Info - Informational messages
.Pp
By default, only log level Notice through Error is logged.
.Pp
Syslog may be used to modify the mask which logging levels are logged.
For example, to enable log levels Emergency - Debug :
.Pp
.Dl % sudo syslog -c networkd -d
.Pp
The networkd settings file may also be used to change the log level.
This method will add some additional logging that may be missing using the
syslog technique listed above. This method is also persistent across runs
of
.Nm
For example, to enable log levels Emergency (1) through Debug (7):
.Pp
.Dl % sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkd networkd_log_level -int 7
.Pp
The networkd settings file may also be used to change the log level for code in
libsystem_network. For example, to enable log levels Emergency (1) through Debug (7) for
libsystem_network code:
.Pp
.Dl % sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkd libnetcore_log_level -int 7
.Pp
A SIGINFO signal will dump a snapshot summary of the internal state to the
system log at log level NOTICE :
.Pp
.Dl % sudo killall -INFO networkd

.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_exfat
.Nd construct a new ExFAT file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl N
.Op Fl R
.Op Fl I Ar volume-serial-number
.Op Fl S Ar bytes-per-sector
.Op Fl a Ar sectors-per-FAT
.Op Fl b Ar bytes-per-cluster
.Op Fl c Ar sectors-per-cluster
.Op Fl n Ar number-of-FATs
.Op Fl s Ar total-sectors
.Op Fl v Ar volume-name
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates an ExFAT file system on device
.Ar special .
If the
.Fl R
option is not given, and the device is already formatted as ExFAT, it will
preserve the partition offset, bytes per cluster, FAT offset and size, number
of FATs, offset to start of clusters, number of clusters, volume serial number,
and volume name (label).  If a volume name was specified via the
.Fl v
option, that name is used instead of the volume's previous name.
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Don't create a file system: just print out parameters.
.It Fl R
Do not check whether the device is currently formatted as ExFAT.  Always derive
the partition offset, bytes per cluster, FAT offset and size, and offset to
start of clusters based on the device type and size.
.It Fl I Ar volume-serial-number
Volume ID, a 32-bit integer.
.It Fl S Ar bytes-per-sector
Number of bytes per sector.  Acceptable values are powers of 2
in the range 512 through 4096.
.It Fl a Ar sectors-per-FAT
Number of sectors per FAT.
.It Fl b Ar bytes-per-cluster
File system block size (bytes per cluster).  Acceptable values are powers of 2
in the range 512 through 33554432.
.It Fl c Ar sectors-per-cluster
Sectors per cluster.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the range
1 through 65536.
.It Fl n Ar number-of-FATs
Number of FATs.  Acceptable values are 1 or 2.  The default is 1.  Using any
value other than 1 is discouraged, and may be incompatible with other devices.
.It Fl s Ar total-sectors
The total number of sectors in the device.
.It Fl v Ar volume-name
Volume name (label).  The name will be converted to UTF-16, and must be no
longer than 11 UTF-16 characters.  ASCII control characters and some punctuation
characters are not allowed (similar to DOS 8.3-style names).  NOTE: The volume
name may be an empty (zero-length) string.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl newfs_exfat /dev/disk0s1
Create a file system, using default parameters (or existing ExFAT layout),
on /dev/rdisk0s1.
.Dl newfs_exfat -v Hello disk2s1
Create a file system with the name "Hello" on /dev/rdisk2s1.
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount_exfat 8 ,
.Xr fsck_exfat 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on error.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Newfs_hfs
builds an HFS Plus file system on the specified special device.
Before running 
.Nm newfs_hfs
the disk should be partitioned using the
.Em Disk Utility
application or
.Xr pdisk 8 .
.Pp
The file system default parameters are calculated based on
the size of the disk partition. Typically the defaults are
reasonable, however
.Nm newfs_hfs
has several options to allow the defaults to be selectively overridden.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl N Ar [partition-size]
Causes the file system parameters to be printed out
without really creating the file system.
If the argument following the
.Fl N
starts with a decimal digit, it is assumed to be a partition size.
The paritition size may be given in decimal, octal (with leading `0'),
or hexadecimal (with leading `0x').
The partition size argument can be specified in 512-byte blocks (with a `b' suffix),
petabytes (`p' suffix), terabytes (`t' suffix), gigabytes
(`g' suffix), megabytes (`m' suffix), or kilobytes
(`k' suffix).  All suffixes indicate binary, not decimal,
multipliers (e.g., `1k' is 1024 bytes).  If no suffix is
specified, the value is assumed to be in bytes; if an illegal
suffix is specified, it results in a size of 0 bytes.
.Pp
If the partition size is given, then no special device argument shall be provided.
If no partition size is given, then the size of the given special device
is used instead, and the special device will not be written to.
.It Fl U Ar uid
Set the owner of the file system's root directory to
.Pa uid .
.It Fl G Ar gid
Set the group of the file system's root directory to
.Pa gid .
.It Fl M Ar mask
Specify the octal access permissions mask for the file system's root
directory.
.It Fl P
Set kHFSContentProtectionBit in the volume's attributes, which will cause the 
volume to be mounted with the "protect" option if the kernel supports it.
.It Fl s
Creates a case-sensitive HFS Plus filesystem. By
default a case-insensitive filesystem is created.
Case-sensitive HFS Plus file systems require a Mac OS X
version of 10.3 (Darwin 7.0) or later. 
.It Fl b Ar block-size
The allocation block size of the file system.  
The default value is 4096.
.It Fl c Ar clump-size-list
This specifies the
.Em clump
and/or
.Em initial
sizes, in allocation
blocks, for the various metadata files.
.Em Clump
sizes are specified with the
.Fl c
option followed by a comma
separated list of the form arg=blocks.
.Pp
Example:  -c c=5000,e=500
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Em a=blocks
Set the attribute file clump size.
.It Em b=blocks
Set the allocation bitmap file clump size.
.It Em c=blocks
Set the catalog file clump size.
.It Em d=blocks
Set the data fork clump size.
.It Em e=blocks
Set the extent overflow file clump size.
.It Em r=blocks
Set the resource fork clump size.
.El
.It Fl i Ar first-cnid
This specifies the initial catalog node ID for user files
and directories. The default value is 16.
.It Fl I Ar initial-size-list
This specifies the
.Em initial
size, in allocation
blocks, for the various metadata files.
.Em Initial
sizes are specified with the
.Fl I
option followed by a comma
separated list of the form arg=blocks.
.Pp
Example:  -I c=5000,e=500
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Em a=blocks
Set the initial attribute file size.
.It Em c=blocks
Set the initial catalog file size.
.It Em e=blocks
Set the initial extent overflow file size.
.El
.It Fl J Ar [journal-size]
Creates a journaled HFS+ volume.
The default journal size varies, based on the size of the volume.  Appending an 'M' to the
journal size implies megabytes (i.e. 64M is 64 megabytes).
The maximum journal size is 1024 megabytes.
.It Fl n Ar node-size-list
This specifies the b-tree
.Em node
sizes, in bytes,
for the various b-tree files.
.Em Node
sizes are specified with the
.Fl n
option followed by a comma separated list of
the form arg=bytes. The
.Em node
size must be a power of two and no larger than
32768 bytes.
.Pp
Example:  -n c=8192,e=4096
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Em a=bytes
Set the attribute b-tree node size.
.It Em c=bytes
Set the catalog b-tree node size.
.It Em e=bytes
Set the extent overflow b-tree node size.
.El
.It Fl v Ar volume-name
Volume name (file system name) in ascii or UTF-8 format.

.Dt NEWSYSLOG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm newsyslog
.Nd maintain system log files to manageable sizes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl CFNnrsv
.Op Fl R Ar tagname
.Op Fl a Ar directory
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility should be scheduled to run periodically by
.Xr cron 8 .
When it is executed it archives log files if necessary.
If a log file
is determined to require archiving,
.Nm
rearranges the files so that
.Dq Va logfile
is empty,
.Dq Va logfile Ns Li \&.0
has
the last period's logs in it,
.Dq Va logfile Ns Li \&.1
has the next to last
period's logs in it, and so on, up to a user-specified number of
archived logs.
Optionally the archived logs can be compressed to save
space.
.Pp
A log can be archived for three reasons:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
It is larger than the configured size (in kilobytes).
.It
A configured number of hours have elapsed since the log was last
archived.
.It
This is the specific configured hour for rotation of the log.
.El
.Pp
The granularity of
.Nm
is dependent on how often it is scheduled to run by
.Xr cron 8 .
Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to run every hour
without any ill effects,
and mode three (above) assumes that this is so.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options can be used with
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Instruct
.Nm
to use
.Ar config_file
instead of
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
and
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.d/*.conf
for its configuration file.
.It Fl a Ar directory
Specify a
.Ar directory
into which archived log files will be written.
If a relative path is given,
it is appended to the path of each log file
and the resulting path is used as the directory
into which the archived log for that log file will be written.
If an absolute path is given,
all archived logs are written into the given
.Ar directory .
If any component of the path
.Ar directory
does not exist,
it will be created when
.Nm
is run.
.It Fl d Ar directory
Specify a
.Ar directory
which all log files will be relative to.
To allow archiving of logs outside the root, the
.Ar directory
passed to the
.Fl a
option is unaffected.
.It Fl v
Place
.Nm
in verbose mode.
In this mode it will print out each log and its
reasons for either trimming that log or skipping it.
.It Fl n
Cause
.Nm
not to trim the logs, but to print out what it would do if this option
were not specified.
.It Fl r
Remove the restriction that
.Nm
must be running as root.
Of course,
.Nm
will not be able to send a HUP signal to
.Xr syslogd 8
so this option should only be used in debugging.
.It Fl s
Specify that
.Nm
should not send any signals to any daemon processes that it would
normally signal when rotating a log file.
For any log file which is rotated, this option will usually also
mean the rotated log file will not be compressed if there is a
daemon which would have been signalled without this option.
However, this option is most likely to be useful when specified
with the
.Fl R
option, and in that case the compression will be done.
.It Fl C
If specified once, then
.Nm
will create any log files which do not exist, and which have the
.Sy C
flag specified in their config file entry.
If specified multiple times, then
.Nm
will create all log files which do not already exist.
If log files are given on the command-line, then the
.Fl C
or
.Fl CC
will only apply to those specific log files.
.It Fl F
Force
.Nm
to trim the logs, even if the trim conditions have not been met.
This
option is useful for diagnosing system problems by providing you with
fresh logs that contain only the problems.
.It Fl N
Do not perform any rotations.
This option is intended to be used with the
.Fl C
or
.Fl CC
options when creating log files is the only objective.
.It Fl R Ar tagname
Specify that
.Nm
should rotate a given list of files, even if trim conditions are not
met for those files.
The
.Ar tagname
is only used in the messages written to the log files which are
rotated.
This differs from the
.Fl F
option in that one or more log files must also be specified, so that
.Nm
will only operate on those specific files.
This option is mainly intended for the daemons or programs which write
some log files, and want to trigger a rotate based on their own criteria.
With this option they can execute
.Nm
to trigger the rotate when they want it to happen, and still give the
system administrator a way to specify the rules of rotation (such as how
many backup copies are kept, and what kind of compression is done).
When a daemon does execute
.Nm
with the
.Fl R
option, it should make sure all of the log files are closed before
calling
.Nm ,
and then it should re-open the files after
.Nm
returns.
Usually the calling process will also want to specify the
.Fl s
option, so
.Nm
will not send a signal to the very process which called it to force
the rotate.
Skipping the signal step will also mean that
.Nm
will return faster, since
.Nm
normally waits a few seconds after any signal that is sent.
.El
.Pp
If additional command line arguments are given,
.Nm
will only examine log files that match those arguments; otherwise, it
will examine all files listed in the configuration file(s).
.Sh FILES

.It Pa /etc/newsyslog.d/

.El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Previous versions of the
.Nm
utility used the dot (``.'') character to
distinguish the group name.
Beginning with
.Fx 3.3 ,
this has been changed to a colon (``:'') character so that user and group
names may contain the dot character.
The dot (``.'') character is still
accepted for backwards compatibility.

The
.Nm
utility originated from
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .

.Dt NFS4MAPID 8
.Os 
.Sh NAME
.Nm nfs4mapid
.Nd shows NFSv4 mappings from uids or gids to
over the wire string names and string names to uids or gids.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfs4mapid
.Op Fl G 
.Ar string name
.Nm nfs4mapid
.Fl u Ar uid
.Nm nfs4mapid
.Fl g Ar gid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the first form,
.Nm nfs4mapid
shows translations from
.Tn NFSv4
string representations of users, and with the 
.Fl G
option, groups to the corresponding local uids and gids.
In the second form, it shows the mapping from uids to the
.Tn NFSv4
user@domain form.
Similarly, in the last form it shows the mapping from gids to
the
.Tn NFSv4
group@domain.
.Nm nfs4mapid
will also show the intermediate GUID translations used. The 
.Tn NFSv4
domain name should be set with
.Xr dscl 1 .
See
.Xr opendirectory 8 
for instructions.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl G
Map an
.Tn NFSv4
string to a gid.
.It Fl u
Map a uid to an
.Tn NFSv4
user@domain string.
.It Fl g
Map a gid to an
.Tn NFSv4
group@domain string.
.El
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
uses a privileged nfs client system call to pass the translation request down to the kernel, so results will be the same as a request coming from an NFSv4 server. Because of this,
.Nm
must be run with root privileges.

.Tn NFS
server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Cm command
.Nm
.Op Fl F Ar exports_file
.Cm checkexports
.Nm
.Op Fl NRrtuv
.Op Fl F Ar exports_file
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers

.Op Cm command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm nfsd
runs on an NFS server machine to service
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MOUNT
protocol requests from NFS client machines.  In order for a machine
to act as an NFS server an NFS exports file,
.Pa /etc/exports ,
must exist and the
.Nm
service must be enabled.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for NFS service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification (2049) and the mountd thread listens for MOUNT
service requests at an available port registered with
.Xr portmap 8 .
.Pp
For more information on the NFS and MOUNT protocols see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094 and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" .
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon is a multi-threaded process that includes a number of threads
processing NFS requests, a thread to accept new socket connections and
a thread that processes NFS MOUNT protocol requests.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started, it loads the export host addresses and options into the
kernel using the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call.  After changing the list of exports (either directly or
indirectly via a change in netgroup membership), a hangup signal should
be sent to the daemon to get it to reload the export information.  This
can be accomplished with the
.Cm update
command described below.
.Pp
Any errors encountered while processing the export entries will
be logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
.Nm
is normally launched by
.Xr launchd 8 ;
however, the
.Nm
command may also be used to manipulate the service
using the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable
.It Cm enable
Enables the
.Nm
service.
.It Cm disable
Disables the
.Nm
service.
.It Cm start
Starts the
.Nm
service.  Note: if the service is disabled it will not be restarted
on reboot.  Use the
.Cm enable
command to make the change permanent.
.It Cm stop
Stops the
.Nm
service.  Note: if the service is enabled it will be restarted on
reboot.  Use the
.Cm disable
command to make the change permanent.
.It Cm restart
Restarts the
.Nm
service (by stopping the service - it will restart automatically if
the
.Pa /etc/exports
file exists).
.It Cm update
Sends a SIGHUP to the running
.Nm
daemon to cause it to update its configuration.
.It Cm status
Displays whether the
.Nm
service is enabled and whether the
.Nm
daemon is currently running.
.It Cm checkexports
Checks the exports file and reports any errors (to stderr).  Note that
this can be useful to verify the validity of an alternate exports file
(using the
.Fl F
option below) prior to putting the changes in place and updating
.Nm .
.It Cm verbose [up|down]+
Sends USR1 and/or USR2 signal(s) to the running
.Nm
daemon to cause it to increase and/or decrease its logging level.  (See
below for details about
.Nm Ns 's
logging).
.El
.Pp
Logging is performed via
.Xr syslog 3
using the LOG_DAEMON facility.  By default, only messages up to priority
LOG_WARNING are logged.  Setting the verbose level to one will add
LOG_NOTICE messages which includes logging failed mount attempts.  A
verbose level of two will increase the log level to LOG_INFO which
includes logging successful mount attempts.  A log level of three or
more will add LOG_DEBUG messages and cause increasing amounts of debug
information to be logged.  The debug information exposes lots of
information about
.Nm Ns 's
inner workings which is typically only useful to developers.
Note: the
.Xr syslog 8
configuration may need to be adjusted in order to see the increased
verbosity.
.Pp
The
.Nm nfsd
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
When given the
.Cm status
command, it exits 0 if the service is enabled, and 1 if the service
is disabled.
.Pp
The following is a list of command line options that are available.
However, since
.Nm
is normally started by
.Xr launchd 8 ,
configuration of these options should be controlled using the equivalent
settings in the NFS configuration file (see
.Xr nfs.conf 5 Ns ).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar exports_file
The
.Ar exports_file
argument specifies an alternate location for the exports file
(useful with the
.Cm checkexports
command).
.It Fl N
Allow non-root mount requests to be served.  This should only be
specified if there are clients that require it.
.It Fl P Ar #
Specifies which port to use for the MOUNT service.
.It Fl R
Allow mount RPCs requests for regular files to be served.  Although
this seems to violate the mount protocol specification, some diskless
workstations do mount requests for their swapfiles and expect them to
be regular files.  Since a regular file cannot be specified in
.Pa /etc/exports ,
the
.Fl alldirs
option will need to be used on the export in which the swap files reside.
.It Fl n Ar #
Specifies how many NFS server threads to create.
.It Fl p Ar #
Specifies which port to use for the NFS service (instead of the default of 2049).
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr portmap 8 .
This option can be used to re-register the NFS services if the portmap
server is restarted.  This option is equivalent to the
.Cm update
command.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.  Note: only
.Tn TCP
will be used if no other options are specified.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.  Note: only
.Tn UDP
will be used if no other options are specified.
.It Fl v
Increase 
.Nm Ns 's
logging level by one (may be used multiple times).
.El
.Pp
.Sh CONFIGURATION
Unless otherwise specified, eight NFS server threads are started and both
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports are supported.
.Pp
A server should run enough threads to handle the maximum level of
concurrency from its clients.
.Pp
See
.Xr nfs.conf 5
for a list of tunable parameters.
.Sh NOTES
The exports list displayed via
.Xr showmount 8
may contain additional information about the status of each export.
This information is reported as entries in the export's group list.
.Pp
If an export is currently unavailable, the group list will begin with
the entry "<offline>" (or "<offline*>" if it is unavailable to some but
not all clients exported to).
.Pp
If an export allows non-default security mechanisms, the group list
will contain an entry indicating what security mechanisms are allowed.
For example: "<krb5:sys>".  The mechanisms are listed in no particular
order and may not be available to all clients.
.Pp
If an export is available to all clients, the group list is usually
empty.  But if additional status information is returned in the group
list, then the list will also contain an explicit "(Everyone)" entry
to indicate that the export is available to all clients.
.Sh FILES

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is deprecated.  See
.Xr nfs.conf 5
for NFS configuration info.
.Pp
.Nm
controls the maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads used
for NFS mounts.  Historically, it has consisted of a daemon that
never exits.  However, asynchronous I/O requests are now serviced
by threads launched on demand in the kernel and the
.Nm
command simply sets the configuration limit.
.Pp
Having asynchronous I/O threads improves performance but is not required
for correct operation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Specify maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads to be used.
.El
.Pp
If no maximum is specified,
.Nm
displays the current value.  The default value is 16.  A client should
allow enough threads to handle its maximum level of concurrency.
.Pp
The
.Nm

.Nd notification server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl log_file Ar path
.Op Fl shm_pages Ar npages
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server for the Mac OS X notification system described in
.Xr notify 3 .
The server is started automatically by
.Nm launchd
during system startup.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
option causes 
.Nm notifyd
to log debugging messages to a log file.
Messages are not logged to ASL to avoid potential deadlocks,
since the ASL system makes use of the
.Xr notify 3
system.
.Pp
The default log file is
.Pa /var/log/notifyd.log .
An alternate log file path may be specified following the
.Fl log_file
flag.
.Pp
The 
.Fl shm_pages Ar npages
option sets the number of shared memory pages used for passive notification.
The default is one page.
If a value of zero is specified,
shared memory is disabled and passive notifications are performed
using IPC between the client and the server.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr notify 3 .

.Dt TALKD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm talkd
.Nd remote user communication server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is the server that notifies a user that someone else wants to
initiate a conversation.
It acts as a repository of invitations, responding to requests
by clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a conversation.
In normal operation, a client, the caller,
initiates a rendezvous by sending a
.Tn CTL_MSG
to the server of
type
.Tn LOOK_UP
(see
.In protocols/talkd.h ) .
This causes the server to search its invitation
tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the caller
(to speak to the callee specified in the message).
.Pp
If the lookup fails,
the caller then sends an
.Tn ANNOUNCE
message causing the server to
broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports requesting contact.
.Pp
When the callee responds, the local server uses the
recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate rendezvous
address and the caller and callee client programs establish a
stream connection through which the conversation takes place.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
utility is managed by
.Xr launchd 8
as specified in the
.Pa ntalk.plist
property list.
By default the property list contains the
.Em Disabled
key set to true, so
.Nm
is never invoked.
.Pp
Execute the following command as root to enable
.Nm talkd :
.Dl "launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ntalk.plist"
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr talk 1 ,
.Xr write 1

.Sh "Note on OS X operation"
ntpd on OS X starts when /private/etc/ntp.conf exists
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ntpd
utility is an operating system daemon which sets
and maintains the system time of day in synchronism with Internet
standard time servers.
It is a complete implementation of the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains
compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1
and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does most computations in 64-bit floating point
arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations
only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232
picoseconds.
While the ultimate precision, is not achievable with
ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be required
with future gigahertz CPU clocks and gigabit LANs.
.Pp
Ordinarily,
.Nm
reads the
.Xr ntp.conf 5
configuration file at startup time in order to determine the
synchronization sources and operating modes.
It is also possible to
specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on the
command line, obviating the need for a configuration file.
This may
be particularly useful when the local host is to be configured as a
broadcast/multicast client, with all peers being determined by
listening to broadcasts at run time.
.Pp
Various internal
.Nm
variables can be displayed and
configuration options altered while the
.Nm
is running
using the
.Xr ntpq 8
and
.Xr ntpdc 8
utility programs.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts it looks at the value of
.Xr umask 2 ,
and if zero
.Nm
will set the
.Xr umask 2
to 022.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Enable authentication mode (default).
.It Fl A
Disable authentication mode.
.It Fl b
Synchronize using NTP broadcast messages.
.It Fl c Ar conffile
Specify the name and path of the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Specify debugging mode.
This flag may occur multiple times,
with each occurrence indicating greater detail of display.
.It Fl D Ar level
Specify debugging level directly.
.It Fl f Ar driftfile
Specify the name and path of the drift file.
.It Fl g
Normally,
.Nm
exits if the offset exceeds the sanity
limit, which is 1000 s by default.
If the sanity limit is set to
zero, no sanity checking is performed and any offset is acceptable.
This option overrides the limit and allows the time to be set to
any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once.
After that,
.Nm
will exit if the limit is exceeded.
This
option can be used with the
.Fl q
option.
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Specify the name and path of the file containing the NTP
authentication keys.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Specify the name and path of the log file.
The default is the
system log facility.
.It Fl L
Listen to virtual IPs.
.It Fl m
Synchronize using NTP multicast messages on the IP multicast
group address 224.0.1.1 (requires multicast kernel).
.It Fl n
Don't fork.
.It Fl N Ar priority
To the extent permitted by the operating system, run the
.Nm
at a high priority.
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Specify the name and path to record the
.Nm Ns 's
process
ID.
.It Fl P
Override the priority limit set by the operating system.
Not
recommended for sissies.
.It Fl q
Exit the
.Nm
just after the first time the clock is
set.
This behavior mimics that of the
.Xr ntpdate 8
program,
which is to be retired.
The
.Fl g
and
.Fl x
options can
be used with this option.
.It Fl r Ar broadcastdelay
Specify the default propagation delay from the
broadcast/multicast server and this computer.
This is necessary
only if the delay cannot be computed automatically by the
protocol.
.It Fl s Ar statsdir
Specify the directory path for files created by the statistics
facility.
.It Fl t Ar key
Add a key number to the trusted key list.
.It Fl v Ar variable
.It Fl V Ar variable
Add a system variable listed by default.
.It Fl x
Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less than the
step threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and stepped if above
the threshold.
This option forces the time to be slewed in all
cases.
If the step threshold is set to zero, all offsets are
stepped, regardless of value and regardless of the
.Fl x
option.
In general, this is not a good idea, as it bypasses the
clock state machine which is designed to cope with large time and
frequency errors Note: Since the slew rate is limited to 0.5 ms/s,
each second of adjustment requires an amortization interval of 2000
s.
Thus, an adjustment of many seconds can take hours or days to
amortize.
This option can be used with the
.Fl q
option.
.El
.Ss "How NTP Operates"
The
.Nm
utility operates by exchanging messages with
one or more configured servers at designated poll intervals.
When
started, whether for the first or subsequent times, the program
requires several exchanges from the majority of these servers so
the signal processing and mitigation algorithms can accumulate and
groom the data and set the clock.
In order to protect the network
from bursts, the initial poll interval for each server is delayed
an interval randomized over 0-16s.
At the default initial poll
interval of 64s, several minutes can elapse before the clock is
set.
The initial delay to set the clock can be reduced using the
.Cm iburst
keyword with the
.Ic server
configuration
command, as described in
.Xr ntp.conf 5 .
.Pp
Most operating systems and hardware of today incorporate a
time-of-year (TOY) chip to maintain the time during periods when
the power is off.
When the machine is booted, the chip is used to
initialize the operating system time.
After the machine has
synchronized to a NTP server, the operating system corrects the
chip from time to time.
In case there is no TOY chip or for some
reason its time is more than 1000s from the server time,
.Nm
assumes something must be terribly wrong and the only
reliable action is for the operator to intervene and set the clock
by hand.
This causes
.Nm
to exit with a panic message to
the system log.
The
.Fl g
option overrides this check and the
clock will be set to the server time regardless of the chip time.
However, and to protect against broken hardware, such as when the
CMOS battery fails or the clock counter becomes defective, once the
clock has been set, an error greater than 1000s will cause
.Nm
to exit anyway.
.Pp
Under ordinary conditions,
.Nm
adjusts the clock in
small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous and
without discontinuities.
Under conditions of extreme network
congestion, the roundtrip delay jitter can exceed three seconds and
the synchronization distance, which is equal to one-half the
roundtrip delay plus error budget terms, can become very large.
The
.Nm
algorithms discard sample offsets exceeding 128 ms,
unless the interval during which no sample offset is less than 128
ms exceeds 900s.
The first sample after that, no matter what the
offset, steps the clock to the indicated time.
In practice this
reduces the false alarm rate where the clock is stepped in error to
a vanishingly low incidence.
.Pp
As the result of this behavior, once the clock has been set, it
very rarely strays more than 128 ms, even under extreme cases of
network path congestion and jitter.
Sometimes, in particular when
.Nm
is first started, the error might exceed 128 ms.
This
may on occasion cause the clock to be set backwards if the local
clock time is more than 128 s in the future relative to the server.
In some applications, this behavior may be unacceptable.
If the
.Fl x
option is included on the command line, the clock will
never be stepped and only slew corrections will be used.
.Pp
The issues should be carefully explored before deciding to use
the
.Fl x
option.
The maximum slew rate possible is limited
to 500 parts-per-million (PPM) as a consequence of the correctness
principles on which the NTP protocol and algorithm design are
based.
As a result, the local clock can take a long time to
converge to an acceptable offset, about 2,000 s for each second the
clock is outside the acceptable range.
During this interval the
local clock will not be consistent with any other network clock and
the system cannot be used for distributed applications that require
correctly synchronized network time.
.Pp
In spite of the above precautions, sometimes when large
frequency errors are present the resulting time offsets stray
outside the 128-ms range and an eventual step or slew time
correction is required.
If following such a correction the
frequency error is so large that the first sample is outside the
acceptable range,
.Nm
enters the same state as when the
.Pa ntp.drift
file is not present.
The intent of this behavior
is to quickly correct the frequency and restore operation to the
normal tracking mode.
In the most extreme cases
(time.ien.it comes to mind), there may be occasional
step/slew corrections and subsequent frequency corrections.
It
helps in these cases to use the
.Cm burst
keyword when
configuring the server.
.Ss "Frequency Discipline"
The
.Nm
behavior at startup depends on whether the
frequency file, usually
.Pa ntp.drift ,
exists.
This file
contains the latest estimate of clock frequency error.
When the
.Nm
is started and the file does not exist, the
.Nm
enters a special mode designed to quickly adapt to
the particular system clock oscillator time and frequency error.
This takes approximately 15 minutes, after which the time and
frequency are set to nominal values and the
.Nm
enters
normal mode, where the time and frequency are continuously tracked
relative to the server.
After one hour the frequency file is
created and the current frequency offset written to it.
When the
.Nm
is started and the file does exist, the
.Nm
frequency is initialized from the file and enters normal mode
immediately.
After that the current frequency offset is written to
the file at hourly intervals.
.Ss "Operating Modes"
The
.Nm
utility can operate in any of several modes, including
symmetric active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast and
manycast, as described in the
.Qq Association Management
page
(available as part of the HTML documentation
provided in
.Pa /usr/share/doc/ntp ) .
It normally operates continuously while
monitoring for small changes in frequency and trimming the clock
for the ultimate precision.
However, it can operate in a one-time
mode where the time is set from an external server and frequency is
set from a previously recorded frequency file.
A
broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers,
compute server-client propagation delay correction factors and
configure itself automatically.
This makes it possible to deploy a
fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details
specific to the local environment.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
runs in continuous mode where each of
possibly several external servers is polled at intervals determined
by an intricate state machine.
The state machine measures the
incidental roundtrip delay jitter and oscillator frequency wander
and determines the best poll interval using a heuristic algorithm.
Ordinarily, and in most operating environments, the state machine
will start with 64s intervals and eventually increase in steps to
1024s.
A small amount of random variation is introduced in order to
avoid bunching at the servers.
In addition, should a server become
unreachable for some time, the poll interval is increased in steps
to 1024s in order to reduce network overhead.
.Pp
In some cases it may not be practical for
.Nm
to run
continuously.
A common workaround has been to run the
.Xr ntpdate 8
program from a
.Xr cron 8
job at designated
times.
However, this program does not have the crafted signal
processing, error checking and mitigation algorithms of
.Nm .
The
.Fl q
option is intended for this purpose.
Setting this option will cause
.Nm
to exit just after
setting the clock for the first time.
The procedure for initially
setting the clock is the same as in continuous mode; most
applications will probably want to specify the
.Cm iburst
keyword with the
.Ic server
configuration command.
With this
keyword a volley of messages are exchanged to groom the data and
the clock is set in about a minute.
If nothing is heard after a
couple of minutes, the daemon times out and exits.
After a suitable
period of mourning, the
.Xr ntpdate 8
program may be
retired.
.Pp
When kernel support is available to discipline the clock
frequency, which is the case for stock Solaris, Tru64, Linux and
.Fx ,
a useful feature is available to discipline the clock
frequency.
First,
.Nm
is run in continuous mode with
selected servers in order to measure and record the intrinsic clock
frequency offset in the frequency file.
It may take some hours for
the frequency and offset to settle down.
Then the
.Nm
is
stopped and run in one-time mode as required.
At each startup, the
frequency is read from the file and initializes the kernel
frequency.
.Ss "Poll Interval Control"
This version of NTP includes an intricate state machine to
reduce the network load while maintaining a quality of
synchronization consistent with the observed jitter and wander.
There are a number of ways to tailor the operation in order enhance
accuracy by reducing the interval or to reduce network overhead by
increasing it.
However, the user is advised to carefully consider
the consequences of changing the poll adjustment range from the
default minimum of 64 s to the default maximum of 1,024 s.
The
default minimum can be changed with the
.Ic tinker
.Cm minpoll
command to a value not less than 16 s.
This value is used for all
configured associations, unless overridden by the
.Cm minpoll
option on the configuration command.
Note that most device drivers
will not operate properly if the poll interval is less than 64 s
and that the broadcast server and manycast client associations will
also use the default, unless overridden.
.Pp
In some cases involving dial up or toll services, it may be
useful to increase the minimum interval to a few tens of minutes
and maximum interval to a day or so.
Under normal operation
conditions, once the clock discipline loop has stabilized the
interval will be increased in steps from the minimum to the
maximum.
However, this assumes the intrinsic clock frequency error
is small enough for the discipline loop correct it.
The capture
range of the loop is 500 PPM at an interval of 64s decreasing by a
factor of two for each doubling of interval.
At a minimum of 1,024
s, for example, the capture range is only 31 PPM.
If the intrinsic
error is greater than this, the drift file
.Pa ntp.drift
will
have to be specially tailored to reduce the residual error below
this limit.
Once this is done, the drift file is automatically
updated once per hour and is available to initialize the frequency
on subsequent daemon restarts. If the system is conserving energy by spinning
down the disk or sleeping when idle then the update is deferred until 
ntpd terminates.
.Ss "The huff-n'-puff filter"
In scenarios where a considerable amount of data are to be
downloaded or uploaded over telephone modems, timekeeping quality
can be seriously degraded.
This occurs because the differential
delays on the two directions of transmission can be quite large.
In
many cases the apparent time errors are so large as to exceed the
step threshold and a step correction can occur during and after the
data transfer is in progress.
.Pp
The huff-n'-puff filter is designed to correct the apparent time
offset in these cases.
It depends on knowledge of the propagation
delay when no other traffic is present.
In common scenarios this
occurs during other than work hours.
The filter maintains a shift
register that remembers the minimum delay over the most recent
interval measured usually in hours.
Under conditions of severe
delay, the filter corrects the apparent offset using the sign of
the offset and the difference between the apparent delay and
minimum delay.
The name of the filter reflects the negative (huff)
and positive (puff) correction, which depends on the sign of the
offset.
.Pp
The filter is activated by the
.Ic tinker command and
.Cm huffpuff
keyword, as described in
.Xr ntp.conf 5 .

The

While not huge, it has gotten
larger than might be desirable for an elevated-priority

running on a workstation, particularly since many of
the fancy features which consume the space were designed more with
a busy primary server, rather than a high stratum workstation in
mind.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Em Note :
The functionality of this program is now available
in the
.Xr ntpd 8
program.
See the
.Fl q
command line
option in the
.Xr ntpd 8
page.
After a suitable period of
mourning, the
.Nm
utility is to be retired from this
distribution.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility sets the local date and time by polling the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the
.Ar server
arguments to determine the correct time.
It must be run as root on
the local host.
A number of samples are obtained from each of the
servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and
selection algorithms are applied to select the best of these.
Note
that the accuracy and reliability of
.Nm
depends on
the number of servers, the number of polls each time it is run and
the interval between runs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar key
Enable the authentication function and specify the key
identifier to be used for authentication as the argument
.Ar key .
The keys and key identifiers must match
in both the client and server key files.
The default is to disable
the authentication function.
.It Fl B
Force the time to always be slewed using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system
call, even if the measured offset is greater than +-128 ms.
The
default is to step the time using
.Xr settimeofday 2
if the offset is
greater than +-128 ms.
Note that, if the offset is much greater
than +-128 ms in this case, it can take a long time (hours) to
slew the clock to the correct value.
During this time, the host
should not be used to synchronize clients.
.It Fl b
Force the time to be stepped using the
.Xr settimeofday 2
system
call, rather than slewed (default) using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call.
This option should be used when called from a startup file at boot
time.
.It Fl d
Enable the debugging mode, in which
.Nm
will go
through all the steps, but not adjust the local clock.
Information
useful for general debugging will also be printed.
.It Fl e Ar authdelay
Specify the processing delay to perform an authentication
function as the value
.Ar authdelay ,
in seconds and fraction
(see
.Xr ntpd 8
for details).
This number is usually small
enough to be negligible for most purposes, though specifying a
value may improve timekeeping on very slow CPU's.
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Specify the path for the authentication key file as the string
.Ar keyfile .
The default is
.Pa /etc/ntp.keys .
This file
should be in the format described in
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It Fl o Ar version
Specify the NTP version for outgoint packets as the integer
.Ar version ,
which can be 1 or 2.
The default is 3.
This allows
.Nm
to be used with older NTP versions.
.It Fl p Ar samples
Specify the number of samples to be acquired from each server
as the integer
.Ar samples ,
with values from 1 to 8 inclusive.
The default is 4.
.It Fl q
Query only - don't set the clock.
.It Fl s
Divert logging output from the standard output (default) to the
system
.Xr syslog 3
facility.
This is designed primarily for
convenience of
.Xr cron 8
scripts.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Specify the maximum time waiting for a server response as the
value
.Ar timeout ,
in seconds and fraction.
The value is
rounded to a multiple of 0.2 seconds.
The default is 1 second, a
value suitable for polling across a LAN.
.It Fl u
Direct
.Nm
to use an unprivileged port for outgoing
packets.
This is most useful when behind a firewall that blocks
incoming traffic to privileged ports, and you want to synchronise
with hosts beyond the firewall.
Note that the
.Fl d
option
always uses unprivileged ports.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
This option will cause
.Nm Ns 's
version
identification string to be logged.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be run manually as necessary to set the
host clock, or it can be run from the host startup script to set
the clock at boot time.
This is useful in some cases to set the
clock initially before starting the NTP daemon
.Xr ntpd 8 .
It is
also possible to run
.Nm
from a
.Xr cron 8
script.
However, it is important to note that
.Nm
with
contrived
.Xr cron 8
scripts is no substitute for the NTP
daemon, which uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy
and reliability while minimizing resource use.
Finally, since
.Nm
does not discipline the host clock frequency as
does
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
the accuracy using
.Nm
is
limited.
.Pp
Time adjustments are made by
.Nm
in one of two
ways.
If
.Nm
determines the clock is in error more
than 0.5 second it will simply step the time by calling the system
.Xr settimeofday 2
routine.
If the error is less than 0.5
seconds, it will slew the time by calling the system
.Xr adjtime 2
routine.
The latter technique is less disruptive
and more accurate when the error is small, and works quite well
when
.Nm
is run by
.Xr cron 8
every hour or
two.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will decline to set the date if an NTP server
daemon (e.g.,
.Xr ntpd 8 )
is running on the same host.
When
running
.Nm
on a regular basis from
.Xr cron 8
as
an alternative to running a daemon, doing so once every hour or two
will result in precise enough timekeeping to avoid stepping the
clock.

The slew adjustment is actually 50% larger than the measured
offset, since this (it is argued) will tend to keep a badly
drifting clock more accurate.
This is probably not a good idea and
may cause a troubling hunt for some values of the kernel variables
.Va kern.clockrate.tick

.Nd "trace a chain of NTP servers back to the primary source"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl vdn
.Op Fl r Ar retries
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Op Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility determines where a given Network Time Protocol (NTP) server gets
its time from, and follows the chain of NTP servers back to their
master time source.
If given no arguments, it starts with
.Dq localhost .
.Pp
Here is an example of the output from
.Nm :
.Bd -literal
% ntptrace
localhost: stratum 4, offset 0.0019529, synch distance 0.144135
server2ozo.com: stratum 2, offset 0.0124263, synch distance 0.115784
usndh.edu: stratum 1, offset 0.0019298, synch distance 0.011993, refid 'WWVB'
.Ed
.Pp
On each line, the fields are (left to right): the host name, the
host stratum,
the time offset between that host and the local host
(as measured by
.Nm ;
this is why it is not always zero for
.Dq localhost ) ,
the host
synchronization distance,
and (only for stratum-1 servers) the reference clock ID.  All times
are given in seconds.
Note that the stratum is the server hop count to the primary source,
while the synchronization distance is the estimated error
relative to the primary source.
These terms are precisely defined in RFC 1305.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Turn on some debugging output.
.It Fl n
Turn off the printing of host names; instead, host IP addresses
are given.  This may be necessary if a nameserver is down.
.It Fl r Ar retries
Set the number of retransmission attempts for each host; the default is 5.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Set the retransmission timeout (in seconds); the default is 2.
.It Fl v
Print verbose information about the NTP servers.

.SH NAME
nvram \- manipulate firmware NVRAM variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nvram
[
.B -p
] [
.B -f 
.IR filename
] [
.B -d 
.IR name
] [
.B -c
] [
.IR name
[=
.IR value
]] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I nvram
command allows manipulation of firmware NVRAM variables.  It
can be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print
all of the variables or set a list of variables from a file.
Changes to NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.
.LP
In principle,
.IR name
can be any string.  In practice, not all strings will be accepted.
New World machines can create new variables as desired.  Some variables
require administrator privilege to get or set.
.LP
The given
.IR value
must match the data type required for
.IR name .
Binary data can be set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex
value of the byte.  The type for new variables is always binary
data.
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ==========
.TP
.BI \-d " name"
Deletes the named firmware variable.
.\" ==========
.TP
.BI \-f " filename"
Set firmware variables from a text file.  The file must be a
list of "name value" statements.  The first space on each line
is taken to be the separator between "name" and "value".  If
the last character of a line is \\, the value extends to the next line.
.\" ==========
.TP
.B \-x
Use XML format for reading and writing variables.
This option must be used before the
.B \-p
or
.B \-f
options, since arguments are processed in order.
.TP
.B \-c
Delete all of the firmware variables.
.TP
.B \-p
Print all of the firmware variables.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.RS
example% nvram boot-args="-s rd=*hd:10"
.RE
.LP
Set the boot-args variable to "-s rd=*hd:10".  This would specify
single user mode with the root device in hard drive partition 10.
.LP
.RS
example% nvram my-variable="String One%00String Two%00%00"
.RE
.LP
Create a new variable, my-variable, containing a list of two
C-strings that is terminated by a NUL.
.LP
.RS
example% nvram -d my-variable
.RE
.LP
Deletes the variable named my-variable.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that takes a user name specified by
.Ar username
and, if there's a user record for that user in Open Directory,
and that user record contains a HomeDirectory attribute,
and the <path> portion of the HomeDirectory attribute is empty or just /,
prints the URL from that attribute, and exits with an exit status of 0.
If there is no user record for that user, or the user record doesn't
contain a HomeDirectory attribute, or the <path> portion is neither
empty nor just /, or if an error occurs, nothing is printed, and
.Nm
exits with a user status of 1.
This is intended to be used as an executable map for auto_home.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a 
.Xr launchd 8
job which replaces 
.Qq DirectoryService
as a core part of the Open Directory technology. Several modules are provided that allow 
access to existing directory systems:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Active Directory
.It
LDAP
.It
Local Database
.It
NIS
.El
.Ss Modules
.Nm
modules have specific capabilities:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width "Authentication" -compact
.It Pa Authentication
password verification, password changes, etc.
.It Pa Connection
general connections used for queries, record modifications, etc.
.It Pa Discovery
location and prioritization of servers to contact (a.k.a., service discovery)
.It Pa Unspecified
a generic module used for unspecified purpose (usually to extend capabilities)
.El
.Pp
Third party plugins developed for 
.Qq DirectoryService
are supported via
.Xr dspluginhelperd 8 .
.Ss Open Directory
Open Directory is a technology which includes a client API abstraction layer, a directory server, and the
.Nm
daemon.  This allows clients to utilize a single API to access a variety of directory servers simultaneously or
configure their own directory server.
.Pp
Open Directory forms the foundation of how Mac OS X accesses all authoritative configuration information
(users, groups, mounts, managed desktop data, etc.).  This allows use of virtually any
directory system via Apple and third party modules.
.Pp
Configuration of
.Nm
is done via 
.Qq System Preferences
under the
.Qq Users & Groups
preference pane. Advanced settings are available by using 
.Qq Open Directory Utility...
within
.Qq Users & Groups
preference pane.
.Pp
More information is available from the Open Directory website:
.Pp
    http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/opendirectory/
.Ss Open Directory Server
Open Directory Server utilizes OpenLDAP which is included as part of Mac OS X Client, Mac OS X Server,
and Darwin. OpenLDAP provides a robust and scalable platform for serving directory-based information for both
standalone and networked systems.
.Ss NFSv4 Domain name
The following will set the default domain name used to map user and group identities in NFSv4 client/server operations.

.SH NAME
oqmgr
\-
old Postfix queue manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBoqmgr\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon awaits the arrival of incoming mail
and arranges for its delivery via Postfix delivery processes.
The actual mail routing strategy is delegated to the
\fBtrivial-rewrite\fR(8) daemon.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

Mail addressed to the local \fBdouble-bounce\fR address is
logged and discarded.  This stops potential loops caused by
undeliverable bounce notifications.
.SH "MAIL QUEUES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon maintains the following queues:
.IP \fBincoming\fR
Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up by the
local \fBpickup\fR(8) agent from the \fBmaildrop\fR directory.
.IP \fBactive\fR
Messages that the queue manager has opened for delivery. Only
a limited number of messages is allowed to enter the \fBactive\fR
queue (leaky bucket strategy, for a fixed delivery rate).
.IP \fBdeferred\fR
Mail that could not be delivered upon the first attempt. The queue
manager implements exponential backoff by doubling the time between
delivery attempts.
.IP \fBcorrupt\fR
Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here for inspection.
.IP \fBhold\fR
Messages that are kept "on hold" are kept here until someone
sets them free.
.SH "DELIVERY STATUS REPORTS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon keeps an eye on per-message delivery status
reports in the following directories. Each status report file has
the same name as the corresponding message file:
.IP \fBbounce\fR
Per-recipient status information about why mail is bounced.
These files are maintained by the \fBbounce\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fBdefer\fR
Per-recipient status information about why mail is delayed.
These files are maintained by the \fBdefer\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fBtrace\fR
Per-recipient status information as requested with the
Postfix "\fBsendmail -v\fR" or "\fBsendmail -bv\fR" command.
These files are maintained by the \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon.
.PP
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon is responsible for asking the
\fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemons to
send delivery reports.
.SH "STRATEGIES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The queue manager implements a variety of strategies for
either opening queue files (input) or for message delivery (output).
.IP "\fBleaky bucket\fR"
This strategy limits the number of messages in the \fBactive\fR queue
and prevents the queue manager from running out of memory under
heavy load.
.IP \fBfairness\fR
When the \fBactive\fR queue has room, the queue manager takes one
message from the \fBincoming\fR queue and one from the \fBdeferred\fR
queue. This prevents a large mail backlog from blocking the delivery
of new mail.
.IP "\fBslow start\fR"
This strategy eliminates "thundering herd" problems by slowly
adjusting the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination.
.IP "\fBround robin\fR
The queue manager sorts delivery requests by destination.
Round-robin selection prevents one destination from dominating
deliveries to other destinations.
.IP "\fBexponential backoff\fR"
Mail that cannot be delivered upon the first attempt is deferred.
The time interval between delivery attempts is doubled after each
attempt.
.IP "\fBdestination status cache\fR"
The queue manager avoids unnecessary delivery attempts by
maintaining a short-term, in-memory list of unreachable destinations.
.SH "TRIGGERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
On an idle system, the queue manager waits for the arrival of
trigger events, or it waits for a timer to go off. A trigger
is a one-byte message.
Depending on the message received, the queue manager performs
one of the following actions (the message is followed by the
symbolic constant used internally by the software):
.IP "\fBD (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED)\fR"
Start a deferred queue scan.  If a deferred queue scan is already
in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it finishes.
.IP "\fBI (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING)\fR"
Start an incoming queue scan. If an incoming queue scan is already
in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it finishes.
.IP "\fBA (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL)\fR"
Ignore deferred queue file time stamps. The request affects
the next deferred queue scan.
.IP "\fBF (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD)\fR"
Purge all information about dead transports and destinations.
.IP "\fBW (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP)\fR"
Wakeup call, This is used by the master server to instantiate
servers that should not go away forever. The action is to start
an incoming queue scan.
.PP
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon reads an entire buffer worth of triggers.
Multiple identical trigger requests are collapsed into one, and
trigger requests are sorted so that \fBA\fR and \fBF\fR precede
\fBD\fR and \fBI\fR. Thus, in order to force a deferred queue run,
one would request \fBA F D\fR; in order to notify the queue manager
of the arrival of new mail one would request \fBI\fR.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)
RFC 3464 (Delivery status notifications)
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon is not security sensitive. It reads
single-character messages from untrusted local users, and thus may
be susceptible to denial of service attacks. The \fBoqmgr\fR(8) daemon
does not talk to the outside world, and it can be run at fixed low
privilege in a chrooted environment.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to the \fBsyslog\fR(8) daemon.
Corrupted message files are saved to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue
for further inspection.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
A single queue manager process has to compete for disk access with
multiple front-end processes such as \fBcleanup\fR(8). A sudden burst of
inbound mail can negatively impact outbound delivery rates.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are not picked up automatically,
as \fBoqmgr\fR(8)
is a persistent process. Use the command "\fBpostfix reload\fR" after
a configuration change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

In the text below, \fItransport\fR is the first field in a
\fBmaster.cf\fR entry.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides the standard script application
.Dq shell
for an Open Scripting Architecture
.Pq OSA
script.  It provides a menu bar and optional splash dialog, and handles routing incoming
Apple events to the script, notably the
.Li run
and
.Li open
events.  It is normally used as the interpreter for a script file, like this:
.Pp
.D1 Li #!/usr/libexec/osaapplet
.Pp
The script, which may be compiled script data, may either follow the interpreter line or be
a separate file in the traditional bundle location
.Li Resources/Scripts/main.scpt Ns No .
.Nm
assumes that it is running inside a bundle; running it without a bundle may produce
unexpected results.

.Nd The Environment PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar function-class
.Ar control-flag
pam_env
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Environment PAM module supports the authentication and session management function classes.  In terms of the
.Ar function-class
parameter, these are
.Dq Li auth
and
.Dq Li session
respectively.  The Environment PAM module has identical support for both supported function classes.
.Pp
The Environment PAM module allows the setting and unsetting of environment variables.  The use of previously set environment variables as well as PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST is supported.
.Pp
This module can also parse a file with simple KEY=VAL pairs on separate lines
.Pq /etc/environment by default .
You can change the default file to parse, with the
.Cm envfile
flag and turn it on or off by setting the
.Cm readenv
flag to 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to this module:
.Bl -tag
.It Cm conffile=/path/to/pam_env.conf
Indicate an alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file to override the default. This can be useful when different services need different environments.
.It Cm debug
A lot of debug information will be printed to the system log.
.It Cm envfile=/path/to/environment
Indicate an alternative environment file to override the default. This can be useful when different services need different environments.
.It Cm readenv=0|1
Turns on or off the reading of the file specified by envfile (0 is off, 1 is on). By default this option is on.
.El
.Sh FILES

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Group PAM module supports the account management function class.  In terms of the
.Ar function-class
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li account
class.
.Pp
The Group account management module permits or denies users based on their membership to a particular group
.Pq or groups
specified with the 
.Cm group
option.  If no groups are specified the default group
.Pq Dq wheel
will be used.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to this account management module:
.Bl -tag
.It Cm deny
Reverse the meaning of the test, i.e., reject the applicant if and only if he or she is a member of the specified group.  This can be useful to exclude certain groups of users from certain services.
.It Cm fail_safe
If the specified group does not exist, or has no members, act as if it does exist and the applicant is a member.
.It Cm group=groupname
Specify the name of the group to check.  This can be a comma-separated list 
.Pq i.e. Dq group=admin,wheel .
.It Cm root_only
Skip this module entirely if the target account is not the superuser account.
.It Cm ruser
Check the membership of the applicant
.Pq PAM_RUSER ,
rather than the target account 
.Pq PAM_USER
.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_krb5
.Nd Kerberos 5 PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar function-class
.Ar control-flag
pam_krb5
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Kerberos 5 PAM module supports the authentication, account management and password management function classes.
In terms of the
.Ar function-class
parameter, these are
.Dq Li auth
,
.Dq Li account
and
.Dq Li password
respectively.
.Ss Kerberos 5 Authentication Module
The Kerberos 5 authentication component
provides functions to verify the identity of a user
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate
and to set user specific credentials
.Pq Fn pam_sm_setcred .
.Fn pam_sm_authenticate
converts the supplied username into a Kerberos principal,
by appending the default local realm name.
It also supports usernames with explicit realm names.
If a realm name is supplied, then upon a successful return, it
changes the username by mapping the principal name into a local username
(calling
.Fn krb5_aname_to_localname ) .
This typically just means
the realm name is stripped.
.Pp
It prompts the user for a password and obtains a new Kerberos TGT for
the principal.
The TGT is verified by obtaining a service
ticket for the local host.
.Pp
When prompting for the current password, the authentication
module will use the prompt
.Dq Li "Password for <principal>:" .
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_sm_setcred
function stores the newly acquired credentials in a credentials cache,
and sets the environment variable
.Ev KRB5CCNAME
appropriately.
The credentials cache should be destroyed by the user at logout with
.Xr kdestroy 1 .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to this authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm default_principal"
.It Cm debug
.Xr openpam_log 3
debugging information at
.Dv PAM_LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm use_first_pass
If the authentication module is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module obtained the user's password, that password is
used to authenticate the user.
If this fails, the authentication
module returns failure without prompting the user for a password.
This option has no effect if the authentication module is
the first in the stack, or if no previous modules obtained the
user's password.
.It Cm try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.Cm use_first_pass
option, except that if the previously obtained password fails, the
user is prompted for another password.
.It Cm forwardable
Obtain forwardable Kerberos credentials for the user.
.It Cm no_ccache
Do not save the obtained credentials in a credentials cache.
This is a
useful option if the authentication module is used for services such
as ftp or pop, where the user would not be able to destroy them.
[This
is not a recommendation to use the module for those services.]
.It Cm ccache Ns = Ns Ar name
Use
.Ar name
as the credentials cache.
.Ar name
must be in the form
.Ar type : Ns Ar residual .
The special tokens
.Ql %u ,
to designate the decimal UID of the user;
and
.Ql %p ,
to designate the current process ID; can be used in
.Ar name .
.It Cm default_principal
Construct the principal from the authenticating user's username, rather
than obtaining it from the AuthenticationAuthority of the  user's
OpenDirectory record.
.It Cm use_kcminit
Don't verify password, instead store the password in kcm and return
success in the pam chain.  So when used in this mode, the pam_krb5
module needs to be configured to be
.Ql optional
and some other module
.Ql required .
.El
.Ss Kerberos 5 Account Management Module
The Kerberos 5 account management component
provides a function to perform account management,
.Fn pam_sm_acct_mgmt .
The function verifies that the authenticated principal is allowed
to login to the local user account by calling
.Fn krb5_kuserok
(which checks the user's
.Pa .k5login
file).
.Ss Kerberos 5 Password Management Module
The Kerberos 5 password management component
provides a function to change passwords
.Pq Fn pam_sm_chauthtok .
The username supplied (the
user running the
.Xr passwd 1
command, or the username given as an argument) is mapped into
a Kerberos principal name, using the same technique as in
the authentication module.
Note that if a realm name was
explicitly supplied during authentication, but not during
a password change, the mapping
done by the password management module may not result in the
same principal as was used for authentication.
.Pp
Unlike when
changing a
.Ux
password, the password management module will
allow any user to change any principal's password (if the user knows
the principal's old password, of course).
Also unlike
.Ux ,
root
is always prompted for the principal's old password.
.Pp
The password management module uses the same heuristics as
.Xr kpasswd 1
to determine how to contact the Kerberos password server.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to this password management
module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm use_first_pass"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm use_first_pass
If the password management module is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module obtained the user's old password, that password is
used to authenticate the user.
If this fails, the password
management
module returns failure without prompting the user for the old password.
If successful, the new password entered to the previous module is also
used as the new Kerberos password.
If the new password fails,
the password management module returns failure without
prompting the user for a new password.
.It Cm try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.Cm use_first_pass
option, except that if the previously obtained old or new passwords fail,
the user is prompted for them.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "KRB5CCNAME"
.It Ev KRB5CCNAME
Location of the credentials cache.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /tmp/krb5cc_ Ns Ar uid" -compact
.It Pa /tmp/krb5cc_ Ns Ar uid

.Ar ( uid
is the decimal UID of the user).

more than once between calls to
.Fn pam_start
and
.Fn pam_end
when using the Kerberos 5 PAM module.

.Op Fl debug

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an agent for the Services menu.  It scans for and vends available Services, to populate the Services menu.
.Pp
.Nm
is NOT related to the pasteboard.  The pasteboard is managed by the pboard agent.
.Pp
.Nm
normally runs the first time Services are needed in any login session.  You may run it manually for debugging Services. If run without any options, pbs will scan for changed Services, cache them along with their English localization on a private pasteboard, and immediately update the Services menu in all running apps. It will also log about any invalid Services declarations in Info.plist. This is useful when developing or testing Services, because it immediately applies any changes.
.Pp
ServicesMenu.strings files for a localization are loaded only when an app running under that localization shows the Services menu.  You may pass pbs language codes (e.g. "fr") to cause it to load that localization immediately.  You may also pass the flag
. Fl existing_languages
to reload already loaded localizations.
.Pp
.Nm
has additional options that are useful for debugging, in particular the -dump_pboard option. The complete list of options is:
.Bl -tag -width "-e"
.It Fl debug
Output debugging information regarding what pbs is doing.
.It Fl dump_pboard
Prints the private pasteboard containing the current Services information.  You can use this to determine which apps are providing Services and where they are located on the filesystem.
.It Fl dump_userdefs
Prints the userdef cache of Services information.  pbs caches Services information in its userdefs to avoid scanning the entire system every boot.  Changed apps are still detected via FSEvents, so there is no need to flush the userdef cache when installing a new Service.
.It Fl flush_pboard
Erases the private pasteboard containing Services information.  The next time the Services menu is shown, pbs will scan for changed Services and update the pasteboard.
.It Fl flush_userdefs
Erases the userdef cache.
.It Fl flush
Equivalent to -flush_pboard and -flush_userdefs, entirely resetting pbs. The next time Services information is needed, pbs will do a complete rescan for apps vending Services, and read their plist.  Note: this rescan may be very expensive!
.El
.Sh HISTORY
First appeared in NextStep.  pbs has historically had responsibilities that ranged from pasteboard management to Unicode glyph generation, but now it only does Services.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a menu driven program which partitions disks using the standard Apple
disk partitioning scheme described in "Inside Macintosh: Devices".
It does not support the Intel/DOS partitioning scheme supported by
.Xr fdisk 8 .
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width "--compute_sizeXX" -compact
.It Fl a
.It Fl -abbr
Abbreviate the partition types shown in the partition list.
.It Fl c
.It Fl -compute_size
Causes
.Nm
to always ignore the device size listed in the partition table
and compute the device size by other means.
.It Fl d
.It Fl -debug
Turns on debugging.
Doesn't add that much output, but does add a new command
.Sq x
to the editing commands that accesses an eclectic bunch of
undocumented functionality.
.It Fl f
.It Fl -fname
Show HFS volume names instead of partition name when available.
.It Fl h
.It Fl -help
Prints a short help message.
.It Fl i
.It Fl -interactive
Causes
.Nm
to go into an interactive mode similar to the MacOS version of the program.
.It Fl l
.It Fl -list
If no
.Ar device
argument is given,
.Nm
tries to list partition tables for all available drives.
Otherwise,
.Nm
lists
the partition tables for the specified
.Ar devices .
.It Fl L
.It Fl -logical
Show partition limits in logical blocks.
Default is physical blocks.
.It Fl r
.It Fl -readonly
Prevents
.Nm
from writing to the device.
.It Fl v
.It Fl -version
Prints the version number of
.Nm .
.El
.Ss Editing Partition Tables
An argument which is simply the name of a
.Ar device
indicates that
.Nm
should edit the partition table of that device.
.Pp
The current top level editing commands are:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
C    (create with type also specified)
c    create new partition
d    delete a partition
h    command help
i    initialize partition map
n    (re)name a partition
P    (print ordered by base address)
p    print the partition table
q    quit editing (don't save changes)
r    reorder partition entry in map
s    change size of partition map
t    change the type of an existing partition
w    write the partition table
.Ed
.Pp
Commands which take arguments prompt for each argument in turn.
You can also type any number of the arguments separated by spaces
and those prompts will be skipped.
The only exception to typeahead are the confirmation prompts on the
.Ic i
and
.Ic w
commands,
since if we expect you to confirm the decision, we shouldn't undermine
that by allowing you to be precipitate about it.
.Pp
Partitions are always specified by their number,
which is the index of the partition entry in the partition map.
Most of the commands will change the index numbers of all partitions
after the affected partition.
You are advised to print the table as frequently as necessary.
.Pp
.\"Creating more than fifteen partitions is not advised.
.\"There may be a bug in old linux kernels which causes
.\"access to the whole disk fail if more than fifteen partitions are in the map.
.\".Pp
The
.Ic c
(create new partition) command is the only one with complicated arguments.
The first argument is the base address (in blocks) of the partition.
Besides a raw number, you can also specify a partition number followed
by the letter
.Sq p
to indicate that the first block of the new partition should be the same
as the first block of that existing free space partition.
The second argument is the length of the partition in blocks.
This can be a raw number or can be a partition number followed by the
letter
.Sq p
to use the size of that partition or can be a number followed
by
.Sq k ,
.Sq m ,
or
.Sq g
to indicate the size in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes respectively.
(These are powers of 1024, of course, not powers of 1000.)
The third argument is the name of the partition.
This can be a single word without quotes, or a string surrounded by
single or double quotes.
.Pp
The
.Ic C
command is similar to the
.Ic c
command, with the addition of a partition type argument after the
other arguments.
.Pp
The
.Ic i
(initalize) command prompts for the size of the device.
.\"This was done to get around a bug in the kernel where it reports the wrong
.\"size for the device.
.Pp
The
.Ic n
(name) command allows the name of a partition to be changed.
.Pp
The
.Ic r
(reorder) command allows the index number of partitions to be changed.
The index numbers are constrained to be a contiguous sequence.
.Pp
The
.Ic t
(change partition type) command allows the type of a partition to be
changed.
.Pp
The
.Ic w
(write) command writes the partition map out.
.\"but there is currently a bug in the interaction between MkLinux and Mach
.\"which causes the partition map not to be reinterpreted.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was originally developed for MkLinux.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Eryk Vershen
.Sh BUGS
Some people believe there should really be just one disk partitioning utility.
.Pp
.\".Nm
.\"should be able to create HFS partitions that work.
.\".Pp
Filesystem volume names are out of place in a partition utility.
This utility supports HFS volume names, but not volume names
of any other filesystem types.
.Pp
The
.Fl -logical
option has not been heavily tested.

.Dt PERIODIC 8
.Sh NAME
.Nm periodic
.Nd run periodic system functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is intended to be called by
.Xr launchd 8
to execute shell scripts
located in the specified directory.
.Pp
One or more of the following arguments must be specified:
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa monthly"
.It Pa daily
Perform the standard daily periodic executable run.
This usually occurs early in the morning (local time).
.It Pa weekly
Perform the standard weekly periodic executable run.
This usually occurs very early on Saturday mornings.
.It Pa monthly
Perform the standard monthly periodic executable run.
This usually occurs on the first day of the month.
.It Ar path
An arbitrary directory containing a set of executables to be run.
.El
.Pp
If an argument is an absolute directory name it is used as is, otherwise
it is searched for under
.Pa /etc/periodic
and any other directories specified by the
.Va local_periodic
setting in
.Xr periodic.conf 5
(see below).
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will run each executable file in the directory or directories
specified.
If a file does not have the executable bit set, it is silently ignored.
.Pp
Each script is required to exit with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It 0
The script has produced nothing notable in its output.
The
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _show_success
variable controls the masking of this output.
.It 1
The script has produced some notable information in its output.
The
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _show_info
variable controls the masking of this output.
.It 2
The script has produced some warnings due to invalid configuration settings.
The
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _show_badconfig
variable controls the masking of this output.
.It >2
The script has produced output that must not be masked.
.El
.Pp
If the relevant variable (where
.Aq Ar basedir
is the base directory in which the script resides) is set to
.Dq Li NO
in
.Pa periodic.conf ,
.Nm
will mask the script output.
If the variable is not set to either
.Dq Li YES
or
.Dq Li NO ,
it will be given a default value as described in
.Xr periodic.conf 5 .
.Pp
All remaining script output is delivered based on the value of the
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _output
setting.
.Pp
If this is set to a path name (beginning with a
.Ql /
character), output is simply logged to that file.
.Xr newsyslog 8
knows about the files
.Pa /var/log/daily.log , /var/log/weekly.log
and
.Pa /var/log/monthly.log ,
and if they exist, it will rotate them at the appropriate times.
These are therefore good values if you wish to log
.Nm
output.
.Pp
If the
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _output
value does not begin with a
.Ql /
and is not empty, it is assumed to contain a list of email addresses, and
the output is mailed to them.
If
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _show_empty_output
is set to
.Dq Li NO ,
then no mail will be sent if the output was empty.
.Pp
If
.Ao Ar basedir Ac Ns Va _output
is not set or is empty, output is sent to standard output.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
utility sets the
.Ev PATH
environment to include all standard system directories, but no additional
directories, such as
.Pa /usr/local/bin .
If executables are added which depend upon other path components, each
executable must be responsible for configuring its own appropriate environment.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf"
.It Pa /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-*.plist
the
.Nm
utility is typically called via these
.Xr launchd 8
jobs
.It Pa /etc/periodic
the top level directory containing
.Pa daily ,
.Pa weekly ,
and
.Pa monthly
subdirectories which contain standard system periodic executables
.It Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
the
.Pa periodic.conf
system registry contains variables that control the behaviour of
.Nm
and the standard
.Pa daily , weekly ,
and
.Pa monthly
scripts
.It Pa /etc/periodic.conf
this file contains local overrides for the default
.Nm
configuration
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success and 1 if the command fails.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
system registry will typically have a
.Va local_periodic
variable reading:
.Pp
.Dl local_periodic="/usr/local/etc/periodic"
.Pp
To log
.Nm
output instead of receiving it as email, add the following lines to
.Pa /etc/periodic.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
daily_output=/var/log/daily.log
weekly_output=/var/log/weekly.log
monthly_output=/var/log/monthly.log
.Ed
.Pp
To only see important information from daily periodic jobs, add the
following lines to
.Pa /etc/periodic.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
daily_show_success=NO
daily_show_info=NO
daily_show_badconfig=NO
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The command may fail for one of the following reasons:
.Bl -diag
.It usage: periodic <directory of files to execute>
No directory path argument was passed to
.Nm
to specify where the script fragments reside.
.It <directory> not found
Self explanatory.

utility first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .

.Sh BUGS
Since one specifies information about a directory using shell
variables containing the string,
.Aq Ar basedir ,
.Aq Ar basedir
must only contain characters that are valid within a
.Xr sh 1
variable name, alphanumerics and underscores, and the first character
may not be numeric.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter device.
It allows ruleset and parameter configuration and retrieval of status
information from the packet filter.
.Pp
Packet filtering restricts the types of packets that pass through
network interfaces entering or leaving the host based on filter
rules as described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
The packet filter can also replace addresses and ports of packets.
Replacing source addresses and ports of outgoing packets is called
NAT (Network Address Translation) and is used to connect an internal
network (usually reserved address space) to an external one (the
Internet) by making all connections to external hosts appear to
come from the gateway.
Replacing destination addresses and ports of incoming packets
is used to redirect connections to different hosts and/or ports.
A combination of both translations, bidirectional NAT, is also
supported.
Translation rules are described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.Pp
The packet filter does not itself forward packets between interfaces.
Forwarding can be enabled by setting the
.Xr sysctl 8
variables
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
and/or
.Em net.inet6.ip6.forwarding
to 1.
Set them permanently in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides several commands.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Load only the queue rules present in the rule file.
Other rules and options are ignored.
.It Fl a Ar anchor
Apply flags
.Fl f ,
.Fl F ,
and
.Fl s
only to the rules in the specified
.Ar anchor .
In addition to the main ruleset,
.Nm
can load and manipulate additional rulesets by name,
called anchors.
The main ruleset is the default anchor.
.Pp
Anchors are referenced by name and may be nested,
with the various components of the anchor path separated by
.Sq /
characters, similar to how file system hierarchies are laid out.
The last component of the anchor path is where ruleset operations are
performed.
.Pp
Evaluation of
.Ar anchor
rules from the main ruleset is described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.\".Pp
.\"For example, the following will show all filter rules (see the
.\".Fl s
.\"flag below) inside the anchor
.\".Dq authpf/smith(1234) ,
.\"which would have been created for user
.\".Dq smith
.\"by
.\".Xr authpf 8 ,
.\"PID 1234:
.\".Bd -literal -offset indent
.\"# pfctl -a "authpf/smith(1234)" -s rules
.\".Ed
.Pp
Private tables can also be put inside anchors, either by having table
statements in the
.Xr pf.conf 5
file that is loaded in the anchor, or by using regular table commands, as in:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pfctl -a foo/bar -t mytable -T add 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8
.Ed
.Pp
When a rule referring to a table is loaded in an anchor, the rule will use the
private table if one is defined, and then fall back to the table defined in the
main ruleset, if there is one.
This is similar to C rules for variable scope.
It is possible to create distinct tables with the same name in the global
ruleset and in an anchor, but this is often bad design and a warning will be
issued in that case.
.Pp
By default, recursive inline printing of anchors applies only to unnamed
anchors specified inline in the ruleset.
If the anchor name is terminated with a
.Sq *
character, the
.Fl s
flag will recursively print all anchors in a brace delimited block.
For example the following will print the
.Dq authpf
ruleset recursively:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pfctl -a 'authpf/*' -sr
.Ed
.Pp
To print the main ruleset recursively, specify only
.Sq *
as the anchor name:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pfctl -a '*' -sr
.Ed
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the ruleset.
.It Fl d
Disable the packet filter.
.It Fl X Ar token
Release the pf enable reference represented by the token passed. 
.It Fl e
Enable the packet filter.
.It Fl E 
Enable the packet filter and increment the pf enable reference count.
.It Fl F Ar modifier
Flush the filter parameters specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl F Cm nat
Flush the NAT rules.
.It Fl F Cm queue
Flush the queue rules.
.It Fl F Cm rules
Flush the filter rules.
.It Fl F Cm states
Flush the state table (NAT and filter).
.It Fl F Cm Sources

.El
.It Fl f Ar file
Load the rules contained in
.Ar file .
This
.Ar file
may contain macros, tables, options, and normalization, queueing,
translation, and filtering rules.
With the exception of macros and tables, the statements must appear in that
order. Use of this option, could result in flushing of rules present in the main
ruleset added by the system at startup. See /etc/pf.conf for further details.
.It Fl g
Include output helpful for debugging.
.It Fl h
Help.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Restrict the operation to the given
.Ar interface .
.It Fl K Ar host | network
Kill all of the source tracking entries originating from the specified
.Ar host
or

A second
.Fl K Ar host
or
.Fl K Ar network
option may be specified, which will kill all the source tracking
entries from the first host/network to the second.
.It Fl k Ar host | network
Kill all of the state entries originating from the specified
.Ar host
or
.Ar network .
A second
.Fl k Ar host
or
.Fl k Ar network
option may be specified, which will kill all the state entries
from the first host/network to the second.
For example, to kill all of the state entries originating from
.Dq host :
.Pp
.Dl # pfctl -k host
.Pp
To kill all of the state entries from
.Dq host1
to
.Dq host2 :
.Pp
.Dl # pfctl -k host1 -k host2
.Pp
To kill all states originating from 192.168.1.0/24 to 172.16.0.0/16:
.Pp
.Dl # pfctl -k 192.168.1.0/24 -k 172.16.0.0/16
.Pp
A network prefix length of 0 can be used as a wildcard.
To kill all states with the target
.Dq host2 :
.Pp
.Dl # pfctl -k 0.0.0.0/0 -k host2
.It Fl m
Merge in explicitly given options without resetting those
which are omitted.

.Cm add ,
.Cm delete ,
.Cm replace ,
and
.Cm test
commands, the list of addresses can be specified either directly on the command
line and/or in an unformatted text file, using the
.Fl f
flag.
Comments starting with a
.Sq #
are allowed in the text file.
With these commands, the
.Fl v
flag can also be used once or twice, in which case
.Nm
will print the
detailed result of the operation for each individual address, prefixed by
one of the following letters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It A
The address/network has been added.
.It C
The address/network has been changed (negated).
.It D
The address/network has been deleted.
.It M
The address matches
.Po
.Cm test
operation only
.Pc .
.It X
The address/network is duplicated and therefore ignored.
.It Y
The address/network cannot be added/deleted due to conflicting
.Sq \&!
attributes.
.It Z
The address/network has been cleared (statistics).
.El
.Pp
Each table maintains a set of counters that can be retrieved using the
.Fl v
flag of
.Nm .
For example, the following commands define a wide open firewall which will keep
track of packets going to or coming from the
.Ox
FTP server.
The following commands configure the firewall and send 10 pings to the FTP
server:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# printf "table <test> { ftp.openbsd.org }\en \e
    pass out to <test>\en" | pfctl -f-
# ping -qc10 ftp.openbsd.org
.Ed
.Pp
We can now use the table
.Cm show
command to output, for each address and packet direction, the number of packets
and bytes that are being passed or blocked by rules referencing the table.
The time at which the current accounting started is also shown with the
.Dq Cleared
line.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pfctl -t test -vTshow
   129.128.5.191
    Cleared:     Thu Feb 13 18:55:18 2003
    In/Block:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
    In/Pass:     [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
    Out/Block:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
    Out/Pass:    [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
.Ed
.Pp
Similarly, it is possible to view global information about the tables
by using the
.Fl v
modifier twice and the
.Fl s
.Cm Tables
command.
This will display the number of addresses on each table,
the number of rules which reference the table, and the global
packet statistics for the whole table:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pfctl -vvsTables
--a-r-  test
    Addresses:   1
    Cleared:     Thu Feb 13 18:55:18 2003
    References:  [ Anchors: 0        Rules: 1        ]
    Evaluations: [ NoMatch: 3496     Match: 1        ]
    In/Block:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
    In/Pass:     [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
    In/XPass:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
    Out/Block:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
    Out/Pass:    [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
    Out/XPass:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
.Ed
.Pp
As we can see here, only one packet \- the initial ping request \- matched the
table, but all packets passing as the result of the state are correctly
accounted for.
Reloading the table(s) or ruleset will not affect packet accounting in any way.
The two
.Dq XPass
counters are incremented instead of the
.Dq Pass
counters when a
.Dq stateful
packet is passed but doesn't match the table anymore.
This will happen in our example if someone flushes the table while the
.Xr ping 8
command is running.
.Pp
When used with a single
.Fl v ,
.Nm
will only display the first line containing the table flags and name.
The flags are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It c
For constant tables, which cannot be altered outside
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.It p
For persistent tables, which don't get automatically killed when no rules
refer to them.
.It a
For tables which are part of the
.Em active
tableset.
Tables without this flag do not really exist, cannot contain addresses, and are
only listed if the
.Fl g
flag is given.
.It i
For tables which are part of the
.Em inactive
tableset.
This flag can only be witnessed briefly during the loading of
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.It r
For tables which are referenced (used) by rules.
.It h
This flag is set when a table in the main ruleset is hidden by one or more
tables of the same name from anchors attached below it.
.El
.It Fl t Ar table
Specify the name of the table.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
A second use of
.Fl v
will produce even more verbose output including ruleset warnings.
See the previous section for its effect on table commands.
A third use of
.Fl v
will produce additional queue statistics related information.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Show queue statistics at intervals of
.Ar wait
seconds.
.It Fl x Ar level
Set the debug
.Ar level
(may be abbreviated) to one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl x Cm none
Don't generate debug messages.
.It Fl x Cm urgent
Generate debug messages only for serious errors.
.It Fl x Cm misc
Generate debug messages for various errors.
.It Fl x Cm loud
Generate debug messages for common conditions.
.El
.It Fl z

.SH NAME
.TP 15
php-fpm \- PHP FastCGI Process Manager 'PHP-FPM'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B php-fpm
[options]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPHP\fP is a widely\-used general\-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for 
Web development and can be embedded into HTML. This is a variant of PHP that will run in the background as a daemon, listening for CGI requests. Output is logged to /usr/var/log/php-fpm.log.
.LP
Most options are set in the configuration file. The configuration file is /private/etc/php-fpm.conf. By default, php-fpm will respond to CGI requests listening on localhost http port 9000. Therefore php-fpm expects your webserver to forward all requests for '.php' files to port 9000 and you should edit your webserver configuration file appropriately.

.SH EXAMPLES
For any unix systems which use init.d for their main process manager, you should use the init script provided to start and stop the php-fpm daemon.
.P
.PD 1
.RS
sudo /etc/init.d/php-fpm start
.RE
.TP
For any unix systems which use systemd for their main process manager, you should use the unit file provided to start and stop the php-fpm daemon.
.P
.PD 1
.RS
sudo systemctl start php-fpm.service
.RE
.TP
If your installation has no appropriate init script, launch php-fpm with no arguments. It will launch as a daemon (background process) by default. The file /usr/var/run/php-fpm.pid determines whether php-fpm is already up and running. Once started, php-fpm then responds to several POSIX signals:
.P

.RS
.B SIGINT,SIGTERM 	\fPimmediate termination
.TP
.B SIGQUIT 			\fPgraceful stop

.fi
.SH NAME
pickup
\-
Postfix local mail pickup
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBpickup\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
dropped into the \fBmaildrop\fR directory, and feeds it into the
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.
Ill-formatted files are deleted without notifying the originator.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon does not interact with
the outside world.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon is moderately security sensitive. It runs
with fixed low privilege and can run in a chrooted environment.
However, the program reads files from potentially hostile users.
The \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon opens no files for writing, is careful about
what files it opens for reading, and does not actually touch any data
that is sent to its public service endpoint.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon copies mail from file to the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon.  It could avoid message copying overhead by sending a file
descriptor instead of file data, but then the already complex
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon would have to deal with unfiltered user data.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
As the \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon is a relatively long-running process, up
to an hour may pass before a \fBmain.cf\fR change takes effect.
Use the command "\fBpostfix reload\fR" command to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.SH "CONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBcontent_filter (empty)\fR"
After the message is queued, send the entire message to the
specified \fItransport:destination\fR.
.IP "\fBreceive_override_options (empty)\fR"
Enable or disable recipient validation, built-in content
filtering, or address mapping.
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBline_length_limit (2048)\fR"
Upon input, long lines are chopped up into pieces of at most
this length; upon delivery, long lines are reconstructed.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBqueue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.
.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that "smtpd" becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the
.Tn ICMP
.No protocol Ap s mandatory
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
datagram to elicit an
.Tn ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE
from a host or gateway.
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
datagrams
.Pq Dq pings
have an IP and
.Tn ICMP
header, followed by a
.Dq struct timeval
and then an arbitrary number of
.Dq pad
bytes used to fill out the packet.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Audible.
Output a bell
.Tn ( ASCII
0x07)
character when no packet is received before the next packet
is transmitted.
To cater for round-trip times that are longer than the interval
between transmissions, further missing packets cause a bell only
if the maximum number of unreceived packets has increased.
.It Fl a
Audible.
Include a bell
.Tn ( ASCII
0x07)
character in the output when any packet is received.
This option is ignored
if other format options are present.
.It Fl b Ar boundif
Bind the socket to interface
.Ar boundif
for sending.
.It Fl C
Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.
.It Fl c Ar count
Stop after sending
(and receiving)
.Ar count
.Tn ECHO_RESPONSE
packets.
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
will operate until interrupted.
If this option is specified in conjunction with ping sweeps,
each sweep will consist of
.Ar count
packets.
.It Fl D
Set the Don't Fragment bit.
.It Fl d
Set the
.Dv SO_DEBUG
option on the socket being used.
.It Fl f
Flood ping.
Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more.
For every
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
sent a period
.Dq .\&
is printed, while for every
.Tn ECHO_REPLY
received a backspace is printed.
This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.Bf -emphasis
This can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.
.Ef
.It Fl G Ar sweepmaxsize
Specify the maximum size of
.Tn ICMP
payload when sending sweeping pings.
This option is required for ping sweeps.
.It Fl g Ar sweepminsize
Specify the size of
.Tn ICMP
payload to start with when sending sweeping pings.
The default value is 0.
.It Fl h Ar sweepincrsize
Specify the number of bytes to increment the size of
.Tn ICMP
payload after
each sweep when sending sweeping pings.
The default value is 1.
.It Fl I Ar iface
Source multicast packets with the given interface address.
This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.
.It Fl i Ar wait
Wait
.Ar wait
seconds
.Em between sending each packet .
The default is to wait for one second between each packet.
The wait time may be fractional, but only the super-user may specify
values less than 0.1 second.
This option is incompatible with the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl k Ar trafficlass
Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMP packets.
The supported traffic classes are
BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV, VI, VO and CTL.
By default 
.Nm
uses the control traffic class (CTL).
.It Fl L
Suppress loopback of multicast packets.
This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.
.It Fl l Ar preload
If
.Ar preload
is specified,
.Nm
sends that many packets as fast as possible before falling into its normal
mode of behavior.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.It Fl M Cm mask | time
Use
.Dv ICMP_MASKREQ
or
.Dv ICMP_TSTAMP
instead of
.Dv ICMP_ECHO .
For
.Cm mask ,
print the netmask of the remote machine.
Set the
.Va net.inet.icmp.maskrepl
MIB variable to enable
.Dv ICMP_MASKREPLY .
For
.Cm time ,
print the origination, reception and transmission timestamps.
.It Fl m Ar ttl
Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.
If not specified, the kernel uses the value of the
.Va net.inet.ip.ttl
MIB variable.
.It Fl n
Numeric output only.
No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.
.It Fl o
Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.
.It Fl P Ar policy
.Ar policy
specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.
For details please refer to
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3 .
.It Fl p Ar pattern
You may specify up to 16
.Dq pad
bytes to fill out the packet you send.
This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.
For example,
.Dq Li \-p ff
will cause the sent packet to be filled with all
ones.
.It Fl Q
Somewhat quiet output.
.No Don Ap t
display ICMP error messages that are in response to our query messages.
Originally, the
.Fl v
flag was required to display such errors, but
.Fl v
displays all ICMP error messages.
On a busy machine, this output can be overbearing.
Without the
.Fl Q
flag,
.Nm
prints out any ICMP error messages caused by its own ECHO_REQUEST
messages.
.It Fl q
Quiet output.
Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and
when finished.
.It Fl R
Record route.
Includes the
.Tn RECORD_ROUTE
option in the
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
packet and displays
the route buffer on returned packets.
Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes;
the
.Xr traceroute 8
command is usually better at determining the route packets take to a
particular destination.
If more routes come back than should, such as due to an illegal spoofed
packet, ping will print the route list and then truncate it at the correct
spot.
Many hosts ignore or discard the
.Tn RECORD_ROUTE
option.
.It Fl r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it
(e.g., after the interface was dropped by
.Xr routed 8 ) .
.It Fl S Ar src_addr
Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing packets.
On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to
force the source address to be something other than the IP address
of the interface the probe packet is sent on.
If the IP address
is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is
returned and nothing is sent.
.It Fl s Ar packetsize
Specify the number of data bytes to be sent.
The default is 56, which translates into 64
.Tn ICMP
data bytes when combined
with the 8 bytes of
.Tn ICMP
header data.
This option cannot be used with ping sweeps.
.It Fl T Ar ttl
Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.
This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how
many packets have been received.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.Tn ICMP
packets other than
.Tn ECHO_RESPONSE
that are received are listed.
.It Fl W Ar waittime
Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.
If a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied, but
considered as replied when calculating statistics.
.It Fl z Ar tos
Use the specified type of service.
.El
.Pp
When using
.Nm
for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify
that the local network interface is up and running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
.Dq pinged .
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.
If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet
loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
in calculating the round-trip time statistics.
When the specified number of packets have been sent
(and received)
or if the program is terminated with a
.Dv SIGINT ,
a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of packets sent and
received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of
the round-trip times.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
(see the
.Cm status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 )
signal, the current number of packets sent and received, and the
minimum, mean, and maximum of the round-trip times will be written to
the standard error output.
.Pp
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.
Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
.Nm
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.Sh ICMP PACKET DETAILS
An IP header without options is 20 bytes.
An
.Tn ICMP
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of
.Tn ICMP
header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.
When a
.Ar packetsize
is given, this indicated the size of this extra piece of data
(the default is 56).
Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type
.Tn ICMP
.Tn ECHO_REPLY
will always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space
(the
.Tn ICMP
header).
.Pp
If the data space is at least eight bytes large,
.Nm
uses the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which
it uses in the computation of round trip times.
If less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times are
given.
.Sh DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
The
.Nm
utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.
Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address,
and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely
(if ever)
a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.
Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address,
since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts
to the same request.
.Pp
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often
indicate broken hardware somewhere in the
.Nm
packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).
.Sh TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
The
(inter)network
layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data
contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into
networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
that does not have sufficient
.Dq transitions ,
such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as
almost all zeros.
It is not
necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example)
on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is
at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and
what the controllers transmit can be complicated.
.Pp
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
have to do a lot of testing to find it.
If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either
cannot
be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than
other similar length files.
You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the
.Fl p
option of
.Nm .
.Sh TTL DETAILS
The
.Tn TTL
value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers
that the packet can go through before being thrown away.
In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement
the
.Tn TTL
field by exactly one.
.Pp
The
.Tn TCP/IP
specification recommends setting the
.Tn TTL
field for
.Tn IP
packets to 64, but many systems use smaller values
.No ( Bx 4.3
uses 30,
.Bx 4.2
used 15).
.Pp
The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most
.Ux
systems set
the
.Tn TTL
field of
.Tn ICMP ECHO_REQUEST
packets to 255.
This is why you will find you can
.Dq ping
some hosts, but not reach them with
.Xr telnet 1
or
.Xr ftp 1 .
.Pp
In normal operation
.Nm
prints the ttl value from the packet it receives.
When a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things
with the
.Tn TTL
field in its response:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Not change it; this is what
.Bx
systems did before the
.Bx 4.3 tahoe
release.
In this case the
.Tn TTL
value in the received packet will be 255 minus the
number of routers in the round-trip path.
.It
Set it to 255; this is what current
.Bx
systems do.
In this case the
.Tn TTL
value in the received packet will be 255 minus the
number of routers in the path
.Em from
the remote system
.Em to
the
.Nm Ns Em ing
host.
.It
Set it to some other value.
Some machines use the same value for
.Tn ICMP
packets that they use for
.Tn TCP
packets, for example either 30 or 60.
Others may use completely wild values.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
At least one response was heard from the specified
.Ar host .
.It 2
The transmission was successful but no responses were received.
.It any other value
An error occurred.
These values are defined in
.In sysexits.h .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The original
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Mike Muuss
while at the US Army Ballistics
Research Laboratory.
.Sh BUGS
Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the
.Tn RECORD_ROUTE
option.
.Pp
The maximum IP header length is too small for options like
.Tn RECORD_ROUTE
to be completely useful.
.No There Ap s
not much that can be done about this, however.
.Pp
Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the
broadcast address should only be done under very controlled conditions.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option is not worth much on busy hosts.

.Tn ICMP6_ECHO_REPLY
from a host or gateway.
.Tn ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST
datagrams (``pings'') have an IPv6 header,
and
.Tn ICMPv6
header formatted as documented in RFC2463.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" old ipsec
.\" .It Fl A
.\" Enables transport-mode IPsec authentication header
.\" (experimental).
.It Fl a Ar addrtype
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information Node Addresses query, rather than echo-request.
.Ar addrtype
must be a string constructed of the following characters.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic a
requests unicast addresses from all of the responder's interfaces.
If the character is omitted,
only those addresses which belong to the interface which has the
responder's address are requests.
.It Ic c
requests responder's IPv4-compatible and IPv4-mapped addresses.
.It Ic g
requests responder's global-scope addresses.
.It Ic s
requests responder's site-local addresses.
.It Ic l
requests responder's link-local addresses.
.It Ic A
requests responder's anycast addresses.
Without this character, the responder will return unicast addresses only.
With this character, the responder will return anycast addresses only.
Note that the specification does not specify how to get responder's
anycast addresses.
This is an experimental option.
.El
.It Fl b Ar bufsiz
Set socket buffer size.
.It Fl B Ar boundif
Bind the socket to interface
.Ar boundif
for sending.
.It Fl C
Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.
.It Fl c Ar count
Stop after sending
(and receiving)
.Ar count
.Tn ECHO_RESPONSE
packets.
.It Fl D
Disable IPv6 fragmentation.
.It Fl d
Set the
.Dv SO_DEBUG
option on the socket being used.
.\" .It Fl E
.\" Enables transport-mode IPsec encapsulated security payload
.\" (experimental).
.It Fl f
Flood ping.
Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more.
For every
.Tn ECHO_REQUEST
sent a period
.Dq \&.
is printed, while for every
.Tn ECHO_REPLY
received a backspace is printed.
This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.Bf -emphasis
This can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.
.Ef
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specifies to use
.Ar gateway
as the next hop to the destination.
The gateway must be a neighbor of the sending node.
.It Fl H
Specifies to try reverse-lookup of IPv6 addresses.
The
.Nm
utility does not try reverse-lookup unless the option is specified.
.It Fl h Ar hoplimit
Set the IPv6 hoplimit.
.It Fl I Ar interface
Source packets with the given interface address.
This flag applies if the ping destination is a multicast address,
or link-local/site-local unicast address.
.It Fl i Ar wait
Wait
.Ar wait
seconds
.Em between sending each packet .
The default is to wait for one second between each packet.
The wait time may be fractional, but only the super-user may specify
values less than 0.1 second.
This option is incompatible with the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl k Ar trafficlass
Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMPv6 packets.
The supported traffic classes are
BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV, VI, VO and CTL.
By default 
.Nm
uses the control traffic class (CTL).
.It Fl l Ar preload
If
.Ar preload
is specified,
.Nm
sends that many packets as fast as possible before falling into its normal
mode of behavior.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.It Fl m
By default,
.Nm
asks the kernel to fragment packets to fit into the minimum IPv6 MTU.
The
.Fl m
option
will suppress the behavior in the following two levels:
when the option is specified once, the behavior will be disabled for
unicast packets.
When the option is more than once, it will be disabled for both
unicast and multicast packets.
.It Fl n
Numeric output only.
No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names from addresses in the reply.
.It Fl N
Probe node information multicast group
.Pq Li ff02::2:xxxx:xxxx .
.Ar host
must be string hostname of the target
(must not be a numeric IPv6 address).
Node information multicast group will be computed based on given
.Ar host ,
and will be used as the final destination.
Since node information multicast group is a link-local multicast group,
outgoing interface needs to be specified by
.Fl I
option.
.It Fl o
Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.
.It Fl p Ar pattern
You may specify up to 16
.Dq pad
bytes to fill out the packet you send.
This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.
For example,
.Dq Li \-p ff
will cause the sent packet to be filled with all
ones.
.\" new ipsec
.It Fl P Ar policy
.Ar policy
specifies IPsec policy to be used for the probe.
.It Fl q
Quiet output.
Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and
when finished.
.It Fl r
Audible.
Include a bell
.Tn ( ASCII
0x07)
character in the output when any packet is received.
.It Fl R
Audible.
Output a bell
.Tn ( ASCII
0x07)
character when no packet is received before the next packet
is transmitted.
To cater for round-trip times that are longer than the interval
between transmissions, further missing packets cause a bell only
if the maximum number of unreceived packets has increased.
.It Fl S Ar sourceaddr
Specifies the source address of request packets.
The source address must be one of the unicast addresses of the sending node,
and must be numeric.
.It Fl s Ar packetsize
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.
The default is 56, which translates into 64
.Tn ICMP
data bytes when combined
with the 8 bytes of
.Tn ICMP
header data.
You may need to specify
.Fl b
as well to extend socket buffer size.
.It Fl t
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information supported query types query,
rather than echo-request.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl t
is specified.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.Tn ICMP
packets other than
.Tn ECHO_RESPONSE
that are received are listed.
.It Fl w
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information DNS Name query, rather than echo-request.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl w
is specified.
.It Fl W
Same as
.Fl w ,
but with old packet format based on 03 draft.
This option is present for backward compatibility.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl w
is specified.
.It Fl z Ar tclass
Use the specified traffic class.
.It Ar hops
IPv6 addresses for intermediate nodes,
which will be put into type 0 routing header.
.It Ar host
IPv6 address of the final destination node.
.El
.Pp
When using
.Nm
for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify
that the local network interface is up and running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
.Dq pinged .
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.
If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet
loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
in calculating the round-trip time statistics.
When the specified number of packets have been sent
(and received)
or if the program is terminated with a
.Dv SIGINT ,
a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of packets sent and
received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of
the round-trip times.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
(see the
.Cm status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 )
signal, the current number of packets sent and received, and the
minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times
will be written to the standard output in the same format as the
standard completion message.
.Pp
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.
Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
.Nm
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.\" .Sh ICMP PACKET DETAILS
.\" An IP header without options is 20 bytes.
.\" An
.\" .Tn ICMP
.\" .Tn ECHO_REQUEST
.\" packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of
.\" .Tn ICMP
.\" header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.
.\" When a
.\" .Ar packetsize
.\" is given, this indicated the size of this extra piece of data
.\" (the default is 56).
.\" Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type
.\" .Tn ICMP
.\" .Tn ECHO_REPLY
.\" will always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space
.\" (the
.\" .Tn ICMP
.\" header).
.\" .Pp
.\" If the data space is at least eight bytes large,
.\" .Nm
.\" uses the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which
.\" it uses in the computation of round trip times.
.\" If less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times are
.\" given.
.Sh DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
The
.Nm
utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.
Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address,
and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely
(if ever)
a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.
Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address,
since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts
to the same request.
.Pp
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often
indicate broken hardware somewhere in the
.Nm
packet's path
(in the network or in the hosts).
.Sh TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
The
(inter)network
layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data
contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into
networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
that does not have sufficient
.Dq transitions ,
such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as
almost all zeros.
It is not
necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example)
on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is
at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and
what the controllers transmit can be complicated.
.Pp
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
have to do a lot of testing to find it.
If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either
cannot
be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than
other similar length files.
You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the
.Fl p
option of
.Nm .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility returns 0 on success (the host is alive),
2 if the transmission was successful but no responses were received,
any other non-zero value if the arguments are incorrect or
another error has occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Normally,
.Nm
works just like
.Xr ping 8
would work; the following will send ICMPv6 echo request to
.Li dst.foo.com .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -n dst.foo.com
.Ed
.Pp
The following will probe hostnames for all nodes on the network link attached to
.Li wi0
interface.
The address
.Li ff02::1
is named the link-local all-node multicast address, and the packet would
reach every node on the network link.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -w ff02::1%wi0
.Ed
.Pp
The following will probe addresses assigned to the destination node,
.Li dst.foo.com .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -a agl dst.foo.com

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr ping 8
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
The
.Nm
utility with IPv6 support first appeared in the WIDE Hydrangea IPv6
protocol stack kit.
.Pp
IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project
.Pq Pa http://www.kame.net/
stack was initially integrated into
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility
is intentionally separate from
.Xr ping 8 .
.Pp
There have been many discussions on why we separate
.Nm
and
.Xr ping 8 .
Some people argued that it would be more convenient to uniform the
ping command for both IPv4 and IPv6.
The followings are an answer to the request.
.Pp
From a developer's point of view:
since the underling raw sockets API is totally different between IPv4
and IPv6, we would end up having two types of code base.
There would actually be less benefit to uniform the two commands
into a single command from the developer's standpoint.
.Pp
From an operator's point of view: unlike ordinary network applications
like remote login tools, we are usually aware of address family when using
network management tools.
We do not just want to know the reachability to the host, but want to know the
reachability to the host via a particular network protocol such as
IPv6.
Thus, even if we had a unified
.Xr ping 8
command for both IPv4 and IPv6, we would usually type a
.Fl 6
or
.Fl 4
option (or something like those) to specify the particular address family.
This essentially means that we have two different commands.

Postfix delivery to external command
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBpipe\fR [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpipe\fR(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue
manager to deliver messages to external commands.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

Message attributes such as sender address, recipient address and
next-hop host name can be specified as command-line macros that are
expanded before the external command is executed.

The \fBpipe\fR(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
appropriate.
.SH "SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Some destinations cannot handle more than one recipient per
delivery request. Examples are pagers or fax machines.
In addition, multi-recipient delivery is undesirable when
prepending a \fBDelivered-to:\fR or \fBX-Original-To:\fR
message header.

To prevent Postfix from sending multiple recipients per delivery
request, specify
.sp
.nf
    \fItransport\fB_destination_recipient_limit = 1\fR
.fi

in the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file, where \fItransport\fR
is the name in the first column of the Postfix \fBmaster.cf\fR
entry for the pipe-based delivery transport.
.SH "COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The external command attributes are given in the \fBmaster.cf\fR
file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:
.IP "\fBchroot=\fIpathname\fR (optional)"
Change the process root directory and working directory to
the named directory. This happens before switching to the
privileges specified with the \fBuser\fR attribute, and
before executing the optional \fBdirectory=\fIpathname\fR
directive. Delivery is deferred in case of failure.
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.
.IP "\fBdirectory=\fIpathname\fR (optional)"
Change to the named directory before executing the external command.
The directory must be accessible for the user specified with the
\fBuser\fR attribute (see below).
The default working directory is \fB$queue_directory\fR.
Delivery is deferred in case of failure.
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.
.IP "\fBeol=\fIstring\fR (optional, default: \fB\en\fR)"
The output record delimiter. Typically one would use either
\fB\er\en\fR or \fB\en\fR. The usual C-style backslash escape
sequences are recognized: \fB\ea \eb \ef \en \er \et \ev
\e\fIddd\fR (up to three octal digits) and \fB\e\e\fR.
.IP "\fBflags=BDFORXhqu.>\fR (optional)"
Optional message processing flags. By default, a message is
copied unchanged.
.RS
.IP \fBB\fR
Append a blank line at the end of each message. This is required
by some mail user agents that recognize "\fBFrom \fR" lines only
when preceded by a blank line.
.IP \fBD\fR
Prepend a "\fBDelivered-To: \fIrecipient\fR" message header with the
envelope recipient address. Note: for this to work, the
\fItransport\fB_destination_recipient_limit\fR must be 1
(see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).
.sp
The \fBD\fR flag also enforces loop detection (Postfix 2.5 and later):
if a message already contains a \fBDelivered-To:\fR header
with the same recipient address, then the message is
returned as undeliverable. The address comparison is case
insensitive.
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.
.IP \fBF\fR
Prepend a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR" envelope header to
the message content.
This is expected by, for example, \fBUUCP\fR software.
.IP \fBO\fR
Prepend an "\fBX-Original-To: \fIrecipient\fR" message header
with the recipient address as given to Postfix. Note: for this to
work, the \fItransport\fB_destination_recipient_limit\fR must be 1
(see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.
.IP \fBR\fR
Prepend a \fBReturn-Path:\fR message header with the envelope sender
address.
.IP \fBX\fR
Indicate that the external command performs final delivery.
This flag affects the status reported in "success" DSN
(delivery status notification) messages, and changes it
from "relayed" into "delivered".
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.
.IP \fBh\fR
Fold the command-line \fB$original_recipient\fR and
\fB$recipient\fR address domain part
(text to the right of the right-most \fB@\fR character) to
lower case; fold the entire command-line \fB$domain\fR and
\fB$nexthop\fR host or domain information to lower case.
This is recommended for delivery via \fBUUCP\fR.
.IP \fBq\fR
Quote white space and other special characters in the command-line
\fB$sender\fR, \fB$original_recipient\fR and \fB$recipient\fR
address localparts (text to the
left of the right-most \fB@\fR character), according to an 8-bit
transparent version of RFC 822.
This is recommended for delivery via \fBUUCP\fR or \fBBSMTP\fR.
.sp
The result is compatible with the address parsing of command-line
recipients by the Postfix \fBsendmail\fR(1) mail submission command.
.sp
The \fBq\fR flag affects only entire addresses, not the partial
address information from the \fB$user\fR, \fB$extension\fR or
\fB$mailbox\fR command-line macros.
.IP \fBu\fR
Fold the command-line \fB$original_recipient\fR and
\fB$recipient\fR address localpart (text to
the left of the right-most \fB@\fR character) to lower case.
This is recommended for delivery via \fBUUCP\fR.
.IP \fB.\fR
Prepend "\fB.\fR" to lines starting with "\fB.\fR". This is needed
by, for example, \fBBSMTP\fR software.
.IP \fB>\fR
Prepend "\fB>\fR" to lines starting with "\fBFrom \fR". This is expected
by, for example, \fBUUCP\fR software.
.RE
.IP "\fBnull_sender\fR=\fIreplacement\fR (default: MAILER-DAEMON)"
Replace the null sender address (typically used for delivery
status notifications) with the specified text
when expanding the \fB$sender\fR command-line macro, and
when generating a From_ or Return-Path: message header.

If the null sender replacement text is a non-empty string
then it is affected by the \fBq\fR flag for address quoting
in command-line arguments.

The null sender replacement text may be empty; this form
is recommended for content filters that feed mail back into
Postfix. The empty sender address is not affected by the
\fBq\fR flag for address quoting in command-line arguments.
.sp
Caution: a null sender address is easily mis-parsed by
naive software. For example, when the \fBpipe\fR(8) daemon
executes a command such as:
.sp
.nf
    \fIWrong\fR: command -f$sender -- $recipient
.fi
.IP
the command will mis-parse the -f option value when the
sender address is a null string.  For correct parsing,
specify \fB$sender\fR as an argument by itself:
.sp
.nf
    \fIRight\fR: command -f $sender -- $recipient
.fi
.IP
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.
.IP "\fBsize\fR=\fIsize_limit\fR (optional)"
Don't deliver messages that exceed this size limit (in
bytes); return them to the sender instead.
.IP "\fBuser\fR=\fIusername\fR (required)"
.IP "\fBuser\fR=\fIusername\fR:\fIgroupname\fR"
Execute the external command with the user ID and group ID of the
specified \fIusername\fR.  The software refuses to execute
commands with root privileges, or with the privileges of the
mail system owner. If \fIgroupname\fR is specified, the
corresponding group ID is used instead of the group ID of
\fIusername\fR.
.IP "\fBargv\fR=\fIcommand\fR... (required)"
The command to be executed. This must be specified as the
last command attribute.
The command is executed directly, i.e. without interpretation of
shell meta characters by a shell command interpreter.
.sp
In the command argument vector, the following macros are recognized
and replaced with corresponding information from the Postfix queue
manager delivery request.
.sp
In addition to the form ${\fIname\fR}, the forms $\fIname\fR and
$(\fIname\fR) are also recognized.  Specify \fB$$\fR where a single
\fB$\fR is wanted.

the domain is \fIdomain\fR.
.sp
This information is modified by the \fBh\fR flag for case folding.
.sp
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.
.IP \fB${extension}\fR
This macro expands to the extension part of a recipient address.
For example, with an address \fIuser+foo@domain\fR the extension is
\fIfoo\fR.
.sp
A command-line argument that contains \fB${extension}\fR expands
into as many command-line arguments as there are recipients.
.sp
This information is modified by the \fBu\fR flag for case folding.
.IP \fB${mailbox}\fR
This macro expands to the complete local part of a recipient address.
For example, with an address \fIuser+foo@domain\fR the mailbox is
\fIuser+foo\fR.
.sp
A command-line argument that contains \fB${mailbox}\fR
expands to as many command-line arguments as there are recipients.

Command exit status codes are expected to
follow the conventions defined in <\fBsysexits.h\fR>.
Exit status 0 means normal successful completion.

In the case of a non-zero exit status, a limited amount of
command output is reported in an delivery status notification.
When the output begins with a 4.X.X or 5.X.X enhanced status
code, the status code takes precedence over the non-zero
exit status (Postfix version 2.3 and later).

Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager
can move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue for further inspection.

A list of flags and their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl A, -all-versions
Matches find all versions of a given plug-in known to the system.
By default, only the latest (highest) version is returned.
.It Fl a
Explicitly adds plugins at the file location(s) given, even if they are not normally eligible for automatic discovery.
Note that database clean-ups may eventually remove them in that case.
.It Fl e Ar election
Perform a matching operation (see -m) and apply the given user election setting to all matching plug-ins.
Elections can be "use", "ignore", and "default". Elections are applied to all plug-ins with given identifier.
.It Fl D, -duplicates
Matches find all physical instances of a given plug-in known to the system, even multiple copies with the
same version.
.It Fl i, -identifier Ar identifier
Specifies a plug-in identifier to match, a short-hand for NSExtensionIdentifier=identifier.
.It Fl l
When matching plugins, requests only the latest version of each plugin.
By default, all known versions are shown.
.It Fl m -match
Requests
.Nm
to scan all registered plug-ins for those matching the given search criteria (see DISCOVERY MATCHING below).
All matching plug-ins are returned, one per line. Add the
.Fl v
option to get more detailed output. This is exactly reproducing the functionality of PlugInKit discovery,
except that no host-specific restrictions are imposed. The
.Fl A
and
.Fl D
options affect the outcome.
.It Fl p -protocol Ar protocol
Specifies a plug-in protocol to  match, a short-hand for NSExtensionPointName=protocol.
.It Fl r
Explicitly removes plugins at the file location(s) given. Note that automatic discovery
procedures may add them back if they are still present.
.It Fl -raw
Present replies from the management daemon (pkd) in raw XML form. This is primarily useful for debugging.
.It Fl v
Asks for more verbose operation. For matching requests, more detail is printed about each matched plug-in.
.El                      \" Ends the list

.Sh DISCOVERY MATCHING
During plug-in discovery, PlugInKit matches plug-ins against match criteria and delivers matching plug-ins.
Only plug-ins that match all given criteria are eligible. Criteria are expressed as "key" (must be present)
or "key=value" (key must be present and have the given value). The -i and -p arguments are shorthands for the
conventional identifier and protocol matching keys.
.p
All matching plug-ins are reduced according to the
.Fl A
and
.Fl D
options given. With
.Fl D,
all eligible plug-ins are
returned. With
.Fl A,
the last-registered (by timestamp) instance of each version is returned. By default, only
the last instance of the highest version is returned. Note that this reduction is applied after matching.
.Sh EXPLICIT CHANGES
The
.Fl a
and
.Fl r
options make changes to the system's plug-in registry. The registry is designed to operate automatically,
and will update on its own as applications are installed, removed, and discovered. The options available through
.Nm
are intended only for limited manipulation during plug-in development and for certain maintenance tasks.
They cannot make permanent alterations of the automatic registry state.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBpostscreen\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix \fBpostscreen\fR(8) server provides additional
protection against mail server overload. One \fBpostscreen\fR(8)
process handles multiple inbound SMTP connections, and decides
which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.
By keeping spambots away, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) leaves more
SMTP server processes available for legitimate clients, and
delays the onset of server overload conditions.

This program should not be used on SMTP ports that receive
mail from end-user clients (MUAs). In a typical deployment,
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) handles the MX service on TCP port 25,
while MUA clients submit mail via the \fBsubmission\fR
service on TCP port 587 which requires client authentication.
Alternatively, a site could set up a dedicated, non-postscreen,
"port 25" server that provides \fBsubmission\fR service and
client authentication, but no MX service.

\fBpostscreen\fR(8) maintains a temporary whitelist for
clients that have passed a number of tests.  When an SMTP
client IP address is whitelisted, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) hands
off the connection immediately to a Postfix SMTP server
process. This minimizes the overhead for legitimate mail.

By default, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) logs statistics and hands
off every connection to a Postfix SMTP server process, while
excluding clients in mynetworks from all tests (primarily,
to avoid problems with non-standard SMTP implementations
in network appliances).  This mode is useful for non-destructive
testing.

In a typical production setting, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) is
configured to reject mail from clients that fail one or
more tests. \fBpostscreen\fR(8) logs rejected mail with the
client address, helo, sender and recipient information.

\fBpostscreen\fR(8) is not an SMTP proxy; this is intentional.
The purpose is to keep spambots away from Postfix SMTP
server processes, while minimizing overhead for legitimate
traffic.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostscreen\fR(8) built-in SMTP protocol engine
currently does not announce support for AUTH, XCLIENT or
XFORWARD.
If you need to make these services available
on port 25, then do not enable the optional "after 220
server greeting" tests, and do not use DNSBLs that reject
traffic from dial-up and residential networks.

The optional "after 220 server greeting" tests involve
\fBpostscreen\fR(8)'s built-in SMTP protocol engine. When
these tests succeed, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) adds the client
to the temporary whitelist, but it cannot not hand off the
"live" connection to a Postfix SMTP server process in the
middle of a session.  Instead, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) defers
attempts to deliver mail with a 4XX status, and waits for
the client to disconnect.  When the client connects again,
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) will allow the client to talk to a
Postfix SMTP server process (provided that the whitelist
status has not expired).  \fBpostscreen\fR(8) mitigates
the impact of this limitation by giving the "after 220
server greeting" tests a long expiration time.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, as
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) processes may run for several hours.
Use the command "postfix reload" after a configuration
change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

NOTE: Some \fBpostscreen\fR(8) parameters implement
stress-dependent behavior.  This is supported only when the
default parameter value is stress-dependent (that is, it
looks like ${stress?X}${stress:Y}, or it is the $\fIname\fR
of an smtpd parameter with a stress-dependent default).
Other parameters always evaluate as if the \fBstress\fR
parameter value is the empty string.

that connect to a backup MX address only. For small sites,
this requires configuring primary and backup MX addresses

.SH NAME
pppd \- Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pppd
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up
modems, DSL connections, and many other types of point-to-point
links.  The \fIpppd\fR daemon works together with the kernel PPP
driver to establish and maintain a PPP link with another system
(called the \fIpeer\fR) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses for each end of the link.  Pppd can also authenticate the
peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer.  PPP can be
used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming
increasingly rare.
.SH FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS
.TP
.I ttyname
Use the serial port called \fIttyname\fR to communicate with the
peer.  The string "/dev/" is prepended to \fIttyname\fR to form the
name of the device to open.  If no device name is given, or if the
name of the terminal
connected to the standard input is given, pppd will use that terminal,
and will not fork to put itself in the background.  A value for this
option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
.TP
.I speed
An option that is a decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate
for the serial device.  On systems such as
4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified.  Other systems
(e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud rates.
.TP
.B asyncmap \fImap
This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end
of the link.  The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the
ASCII control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit
indicates that the corresponding control character should not be used
in PPP packets sent to this system.  The map is encoded as a
hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where the least significant
bit (00000001) represents character 0 and the most significant bit
(80000000) represents character 31.
Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte
escape sequence.
If multiple \fIasyncmap\fR options are given, the values are ORed
together.  If no \fIasyncmap\fR option is given, the default is zero,
so pppd will ask the peer not to escape any control characters.
To escape transmitted characters, use the \fIescape\fR option.
.TP
.B auth
Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network
packets to be sent or received.  This option is the default if the
system has a default route.  If neither this option nor the
\fInoauth\fR option is specified, pppd will only allow the peer to use
IP addresses to which the system does not already have a route.
.TP
.B call \fIname
Read options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/\fIname\fR.  This file may
contain privileged options, such as \fInoauth\fR, even if pppd
is not being run by root.  The \fIname\fR string may not begin with /
or include .. as a pathname component.  The format of the options file
is described below.
.TP
.B connect \fIscript
Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare the link
before the PPP protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up
modem, commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate
phone number.  This option specifies an command for pppd to execute
(by passing it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotiation.
The chat (8) program is often useful here, as it provides a way to
send arbitrary strings to a modem and respond to received characters.
A value
for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
.TP
.B crtscts
Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use hardware flow
control using the RTS and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface.
If neither the \fIcrtscts\fR, the
\fInocrtscts\fR, the \fIcdtrcts\fR nor the \fInocdtrcts\fR option
is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is
left unchanged.
Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement
unidirectional flow control. The serial port will
suspend transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS)
but will be unable to request the modem to stop sending to the
computer. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as
a modem control line.
.TP
.B defaultroute
Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as
the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed.
This entry is removed when the PPP connection is broken.  This option
is privileged if the \fInodefaultroute\fR option has been specified.
.TP
.B disconnect \fIscript
Execute the command specified by \fIscript\fR, by passing it to a
shell, after
pppd has terminated the link.  This command could, for example, issue
commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control
signals were not available.  The disconnect script is not run if the
modem has already hung up.  A value for this option from a privileged
source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.
.TP
.B escape \fIxx,yy,...
Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission
(regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its
async control character map).  The characters to be escaped are
specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas.  Note that
almost any character can be specified for the \fIescape\fR option,
unlike the \fIasyncmap\fR option which only allows control characters
to be specified.  The characters which may not be escaped are those
with hex values 0x20 \- 0x3f or 0x5e.
.TP
.B file \fIname
Read options from file \fIname\fR (the format is described below).
The file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.
.TP
.B init \fIscript
Execute the command specified by \fIscript\fR, by passing it to a shell, to
initialize the serial line.  This script would typically use the
chat(8) program to configure the modem to enable auto answer.  A value
for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
.TP
.B lock
Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file for the
serial device to ensure exclusive access to the device.
.TP
.B mru \fIn
Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to \fIn\fR. Pppd
will ask the peer to send packets of no more than \fIn\fR bytes.
The value of \fIn\fR must be between 128 and 16384; the default is 1500.
A value of
296 works well on very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256
bytes of data).
Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280.
.TP
.B mtu \fIn
Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to \fIn\fR.  Unless the
peer requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will
request that the kernel networking code send data packets of no more
than \fIn\fR bytes through the PPP network interface.  Note that for 
the IPv6 protocol, the MTU must be at least 1280.
.TP
.B passive
Enables the "passive" option in the LCP.  With this option, pppd will
attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the
peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from
the peer, instead of exiting, as it would without this option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I <local_IP_address>\fB:\fI<remote_IP_address>
Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses.  Either one may be
omitted.  The IP addresses can be specified with a host name or in
decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78).  The default local
address is the (first) IP address of the system (unless the
\fInoipdefault\fR
option is given).  The remote address will be obtained from the peer
if not specified in any option.  Thus, in simple cases, this option is
not required.  If a local and/or remote IP address is specified with
this option, pppd
will not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP
negotiation, unless the \fIipcp-accept-local\fR and/or
\fIipcp-accept-remote\fR options are given, respectively.
.TP
.B ipv6 \fI<local_interface_identifier>\fR,\fI<remote_interface_identifier>
Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be
omitted. The identifier must be specified in standard ascii notation of
IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the
\fIipv6cp-use-ipaddr\fR
option is given, the local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above).
On systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived
from the Ethernet MAC address, \fIipv6cp-use-persistent\fR option can be
used to replace the \fIipv6 <local>,<remote>\fR option. Otherwise the 
identifier is randomized.
.TP
.B active-filter \fIfilter-expression
Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to determine
which packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore reset
the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialing
mode.  This option is useful in conjunction with the
\fBidle\fR option if there are packets being sent or received
regularly over the link (for example, routing information packets)
which would otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle.
The \fIfilter-expression\fR syntax is as described for tcpdump(1),
except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
\fBether\fR and \fBarp\fR, are not permitted.  Generally the filter
expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace
in the expression from being interpreted by the shell. This option
is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel
was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).
Note that it
is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing
packets using the \fBinbound\fR and \fBoutbound\fR qualifiers.
.TP
.B allow-ip \fIaddress(es)
Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without
authenticating themselves.  The parameter is parsed as for each
element of the list of allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see
the AUTHENTICATION section below).
.TP
.B allow-number \fInumber
Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number.  A trailing
`*' character will match all numbers beginning with the leading part.
.TP
.B bsdcomp \fInr,nt
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of \fInr\fR bits, and
agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of
\fInt\fR bits.  If \fInt\fR is not specified, it defaults to the value
given for \fInr\fR.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for
\fInr\fR and \fInt\fR; larger values give better compression but
consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries.
Alternatively, a value of 0 for \fInr\fR or \fInt\fR disables
compression in the corresponding direction.  Use \fInobsdcomp\fR or
\fIbsdcomp 0\fR to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely.
.TP
.B cdtrcts
Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control
the flow of data on the serial port.  If neither the \fIcrtscts\fR,
the \fInocrtscts\fR, the \fIcdtrcts\fR nor the \fInocdtrcts\fR
option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial
port is left unchanged.
Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow
control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control line.
.TP
.B chap-interval \fIn
If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer every \fIn\fR
seconds.
.TP
.B chap-max-challenge \fIn
Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to \fIn\fR
(default 10).
.TP
.B chap-restart \fIn
Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for challenges)
to \fIn\fR seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B connect-delay \fIn
Wait for up \fIn\fR milliseconds after the connect script finishes for
a valid PPP packet from the peer.  At the end of this time, or when a
valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will commence
negotiation by sending its first LCP packet.  The default value is
1000 (1 second).  This wait period only applies if the \fBconnect\fR
or \fBpty\fR option is used.
.TP
.B debug
Enables connection debugging facilities.
If this option is given, pppd will log the contents of all
control packets sent or received in a readable form.  The packets are
logged through syslog with facility \fIdaemon\fR and level
\fIdebug\fR.  This information can be directed to a file by setting up
/etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see syslog.conf(5)).
.TP
.B default-asyncmap
Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters to be
escaped for both the transmit and the receive direction.
.TP
.B default-mru
Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation.  With this option,
pppd will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes for both the
transmit and receive direction.
.TP
.B deflate \fInr,nt
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
Deflate scheme, with a maximum window size of \fI2**nr\fR bytes, and
agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum window size
of \fI2**nt\fR bytes.  If \fInt\fR is not specified, it defaults to
the value given for \fInr\fR.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used
for \fInr\fR and \fInt\fR; larger values give better compression but
consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries.
Alternatively, a value of 0 for \fInr\fR or \fInt\fR disables
compression in the corresponding direction.  Use \fInodeflate\fR or
\fIdeflate 0\fR to disable Deflate compression entirely.  (Note: pppd
requests Deflate compression in preference to BSD-Compress if the peer
can do either.)
.TP
.B demand
Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data traffic is present.
With this option, the remote IP address must be specified by the user
on the command line or in an options file.  Pppd will initially
configure the interface and enable it for IP traffic without
connecting to the peer.  When traffic is available, pppd will
connect to the peer and perform negotiation, authentication, etc.
When this is completed, pppd will commence passing data packets
(i.e., IP packets) across the link.

The \fIdemand\fR option implies the \fIpersist\fR option.  If this
behaviour is not desired, use the \fInopersist\fR option after the
\fIdemand\fR option.  The \fIidle\fR and \fIholdoff\fR
options are also useful in conjuction with the \fIdemand\fR option.
.TP
.B domain \fId
Append the domain name \fId\fR to the local host name for authentication
purposes.  For example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but
the fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could
specify \fIdomain Quotron.COM\fR.  Pppd would then use the name
\fIporsche.Quotron.COM\fR for looking up secrets in the secrets file,
and as the default name to send to the peer when authenticating itself
to the peer.  This option is privileged.
.TP
.B dryrun
With the \fBdryrun\fR option, pppd will print out all the option
values which have been set and then exit, after parsing the command
line and options files and checking the option values, but before
initiating the link.  The option values are logged at level info, and
also printed to standard output unless the device on standard output
is the device that pppd would be using to communicate with the peer.
.TP
.B dump
With the \fBdump\fR option, pppd will print out all the option values
which have been set.  This option is like the \fBdryrun\fR option
except that pppd proceeds as normal rather than exiting.
.TP
.B endpoint \fI<epdisc>
Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by the local machine to the peer
during multilink negotiation to \fI<epdisc>\fR.  The default is to use
the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on the system, if any,
otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to the hostname, if any,
provided it is not in the multicast or locally-assigned IP address
ranges, or the localhost address.  The endpoint discriminator can be
the string \fBnull\fR or of the form \fItype\fR:\fIvalue\fR, where
type is a decimal number or one of the strings \fBlocal\fR, \fBIP\fR,
\fBMAC\fR, \fBmagic\fR, or \fBphone\fR.  The value is an IP address in
dotted-decimal notation for the \fBIP\fR type, or a string of bytes in
hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the other types.  For
the MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar
network interface.  This option is currently only available under
Linux.
.TP
.B hide-password
When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to
exclude the password string from the log.  This is the default.
.TP
.B holdoff \fIn
Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link after
it terminates.  This option only has any effect if the \fIpersist\fR
or \fIdemand\fR option is used.  The holdoff period is not applied if
the link was terminated because it was idle.
.TP
.B idle \fIn
Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for \fIn\fR
seconds.  The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are
being sent or received.  Note: it is not advisable to use this option
with the \fIpersist\fR option without the \fIdemand\fR option.
If the \fBactive-filter\fR
option is given, data packets which are rejected by the specified
activity filter also count as the link being idle.
.TP
.B ipcp-accept-local
With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of our local IP
address, even if the local IP address was specified in an option.
.TP
.B ipcp-accept-remote
With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of its (remote) IP
address, even if the remote IP address was specified in an option.
.TP
.B ipcp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipcp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned before starting
to send configure-Rejects instead to \fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipcp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 3).
.TP
.B ipcp-restart \fIn
Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to \fIn\fR
seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B ipparam \fIstring
Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down scripts.  If this
option is given, the \fIstring\fR supplied is given as the 6th
parameter to those scripts.
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned before starting
to send configure-Rejects instead to \fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP terminate-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 3).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-restart \fIn
Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to \fIn\fR
seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B ipx
Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols.  This option is presently only
supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to
include IPX support.
.TP
.B ipx-network \fIn
Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request frame to
\fIn\fR, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x).  There is no
valid default.  If this option is not specified, the network number is
obtained from the peer.  If the peer does not have the network number,
the IPX protocol will not be started.
.TP
.B ipx-node \fIn\fB:\fIm
Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated from each
other with a colon character. The first number \fIn\fR is the local
node number. The second number \fIm\fR is the peer's node number. Each
node number is a hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node
numbers on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid
default. If this option is not specified then the node numbers are
obtained from the peer.
.TP
.B ipx-router-name \fI<string>
Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to the peer
as information data.
.TP
.B ipx-routing \fIn
Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. More than one
instance of \fIipx-routing\fR may be specified. The '\fInone\fR'
option (0) may be specified as the only instance of ipx-routing. The
values may be \fI0\fR for \fINONE\fR, \fI2\fR for \fIRIP/SAP\fR, and
\fI4\fR for \fINLSP\fR.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-local
Accept the peer's NAK for the node number specified in the ipx-node
option. If a node number was specified, and non-zero, the default is
to insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you
will permit the peer to override the entry of the node number.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-network
Accept the peer's NAK for the network number specified in the
ipx-network option. If a network number was specified, and non-zero, the
default is to insist that the value be used. If you include this
option then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the node
number.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-remote
Use the peer's network number specified in the configure request
frame. If a node number was specified for the peer and this option was
not specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which you have
specified.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames which the
system will send to \fIn\fR. The default is 10.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local system will
send before it rejects the options. The default value is 3.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP terminate request frames before the
local system considers that the peer is not listening to them. The
default value is 3.
.TP
.B kdebug \fIn
Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver.  The argument
values depend on the specific kernel driver, but in general a value of
1 will enable general kernel debug messages.  (Note that these
messages are usually only useful for debugging the kernel driver
itself.)  For the Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of
bits: 1 to
enable general debug messages, 2 to request that the contents of
received packets be printed, and 4 to request that the contents of
transmitted packets be printed.  On most systems, messages printed by
the kernel are logged by syslog(1) to a file as directed in the
/etc/syslog.conf configuration file.
.TP
.B ktune
Enables pppd to alter kernel settings as appropriate.  Under Linux,
pppd will enable IP forwarding (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
to 1) if the \fIproxyarp\fR option is used, and will enable the
dynamic IP address option (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to
1) in demand mode if the local address changes.
.TP
.B lcp-echo-failure \fIn
If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead
if \fIn\fR LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP
echo-reply.  If this happens, pppd will terminate the
connection.  Use of this option requires a non-zero value for the
\fIlcp-echo-interval\fR parameter.  This option can be used to enable
pppd to terminate after the physical connection has been broken
(e.g., the modem has hung up) in situations where no hardware modem
control lines are available.
.TP
.B lcp-echo-interval \fIn
If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to
the peer every \fIn\fR seconds.  Normally the peer should respond to
the echo-request by sending an echo-reply.  This option can be used
with the \fIlcp-echo-failure\fR option to detect that the peer is no
longer connected.
.TP
.B lcp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B lcp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before starting
to send configure-Rejects instead to \fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B lcp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 3).
.TP
.B lcp-restart \fIn
Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to \fIn\fR
seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B linkname \fIname\fR
Sets the logical name of the link to \fIname\fR.  Pppd will create a
file named \fBppp-\fIname\fB.pid\fR in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some
systems) containing its process ID.  This can be useful in determining
which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a given peer
system.  This is a privileged option.
.TP
.B local
Don't use the modem control lines.  With this option, pppd will ignore
the state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will
not change the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.
.TP
.B logfd \fIn
Send log messages to file descriptor \fIn\fR.  Pppd will send log
messages to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as sending
the log messages to syslog), so this option and the \fBlogfile\fR
option are mutually exclusive.  The default is for pppd to send log
messages to stdout (file descriptor 1), unless the serial port is
already open on stdout.
.TP
.B logfile \fIfilename
Append log messages to the file \fIfilename\fR (as well as sending the
log messages to syslog).  The file is opened with the privileges of
the user who invoked pppd, in append mode.
.TP
.B login
Use the system password database for authenticating the peer using
PAP, and record the user in the system wtmp file.  Note that the peer
must have an entry in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the
system password database to be allowed access.
.TP
.B maxconnect \fIn
Terminate the connection when it has been available for network
traffic for \fIn\fR seconds (i.e. \fIn\fR seconds after the first
network control protocol comes up).
.TP
.B maxfail \fIn
Terminate after \fIn\fR consecutive failed connection attempts.  A
value of 0 means no limit.  The default value is 10.
.TP
.B modem
Use the modem control lines.  This option is the default.  With this
option, pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the
modem to be asserted when opening the serial device (unless a connect
script is specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
signal briefly when the connection is terminated and before executing
the connect script.  On Ultrix, this option implies hardware flow
control, as for the \fIcrtscts\fR option.
.TP
.B mp
Enables the use of PPP multilink; this is an alias for the `multilink'
option.  This option is currently only available under Linux.
.TP
.B mppe-stateful
Allow MPPE to use stateful mode.  Stateless mode is still attempted first.
The default is to disallow stateful mode.  
.TP
.B mpshortseq
Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in multilink
headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers.  This option is only
available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is
enabled (see the multilink option).
.TP
.B mrru \fIn
Sets the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to \fIn\fR.  The MRRU is
the maximum size for a received packet on a multilink bundle, and is
analogous to the MRU for the individual links.  This option is
currently only available under Linux, and only has any effect if
multilink is enabled (see the multilink option).
.TP
.B ms-dns \fI<addr>
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients, this
option allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name Server)
addresses to the clients.  The first instance of this option specifies
the primary DNS address; the second instance (if given) specifies the
secondary DNS address.  (This option was present in some older
versions of pppd under the name \fBdns-addr\fR.)
.TP
.B ms-wins \fI<addr>
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or "Samba"
clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Windows
Internet Name Services) server addresses to the clients.  The first
instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address; the second
instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS address.
.TP
.B multilink
Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol.  If the peer also
supports multilink, then this link can become part of a bundle between
the local system and the peer.  If there is an existing bundle to the
peer, pppd will join this link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will
create a new bundle.  See the MULTILINK section below.  This option is
currently only available under Linux.
.TP
.B name \fIname
Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to
\fIname\fR.  This is a privileged option.  With this option, pppd will
use lines in the secrets files which have \fIname\fR as the second
field when looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer.  In
addition, unless overridden with the \fIuser\fR option, \fIname\fR
will be used as the name to send to the peer when authenticating the
local system to the peer.  (Note that pppd does not append the domain
name to \fIname\fR.)
.TP
.B noaccomp
Disable Address/Control compression in both directions (send and
receive).
.TP
.B noauth
Do not require the peer to authenticate itself.  This option is
privileged.
.TP
.B nobsdcomp
Disables BSD-Compress compression; \fBpppd\fR will not request or
agree to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.
.TP
.B noccp
Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol) negotiation.  This option
should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by
requests from pppd for CCP negotiation.
.TP
.B nocrtscts
Disable hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) on the serial port.
If neither the \fIcrtscts\fR nor the \fInocrtscts\fR nor the
\fIcdtrcts\fR nor the \fInocdtrcts\fR option is given, the hardware
flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged.
.TP
.B nocdtrcts
This option is a synonym for \fInocrtscts\fR. Either of these options will
disable both forms of hardware flow control.
.TP
.B nodefaultroute
Disable the \fIdefaultroute\fR option.  The system administrator who
wishes to prevent users from creating default routes with pppd
can do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file.
.TP
.B nodeflate
Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not request or agree to
compress packets using the Deflate scheme.
.TP
.B nodetach
Don't detach from the controlling terminal.  Without this option, if a
serial device other than the terminal on the standard input is
specified, pppd will fork to become a background process.
.TP
.B noendpoint
Disables pppd from sending an endpoint discriminator to the peer or
accepting one from the peer (see the MULTILINK section below).  This
option should only be required if the peer is buggy.
.TP
.B noip
Disable IPCP negotiation and IP communication.  This option should
only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests
from pppd for IPCP negotiation.
.TP
.B noipv6
Disable IPv6CP negotiation and IPv6 communication. This option should
only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests
from pppd for IPv6CP negotiation.
.TP
.B noipdefault
Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is specified,
which is to determine (if possible) the local IP address from the
hostname.  With this option, the peer will have to supply the local IP
address during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the
command line or in an options file).
.TP
.B noipx
Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols.  This option should only be
required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd
for IPXCP negotiation.
.TP
.B noktune
Opposite of the \fIktune\fR option; disables pppd from changing system
settings.
.TP
.B nolog
Do not send log messages to a file or file descriptor.  This option
cancels the \fBlogfd\fR and \fBlogfile\fR options.
.TP
.B nomagic
Disable magic number negotiation.  With this option, pppd cannot
detect a looped-back line.  This option should only be needed if the
peer is buggy.
.TP
.B nomp
Disables the use of PPP multilink.  This option is currently only
available under Linux.
.TP
.B nomppe
Disables MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption).  This is the default.
.TP
.B nomppe-40
Disable 40\-bit encryption with MPPE.
.TP
.B nomppe-128
Disable 128\-bit encryption with MPPE.
.TP
.B nomppe-stateful
Disable MPPE stateful mode.  This is the default.
.TP
.B nompshortseq
Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in the PPP
multilink protocol, forcing the use of 24-bit sequence numbers.  This
option is currently only available under Linux, and only has any
effect if multilink is enabled.
.TP
.B nomultilink
Disables the use of PPP multilink.  This option is currently only
available under Linux.
.TP
.B nopcomp
Disable protocol field compression negotiation in both the receive and
the transmit direction.
.TP
.B nopersist
Exit once a connection has been made and terminated.  This is the
default unless the \fIpersist\fR or \fIdemand\fR option has been
specified.
.TP
.B nopredictor1
Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1 compression.
.TP
.B noproxyarp
Disable the \fIproxyarp\fR option.  The system administrator who
wishes to prevent users from creating proxy ARP entries with pppd can
do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file.
.TP
.B notty
Normally, pppd requires a terminal device.  With this option, pppd
will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave
as its terminal device.  Pppd will create a child process to act as a
`character shunt' to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty master
and its standard input and output.  Thus pppd will transmit characters
on its standard output and receive characters on its standard input
even if they are not terminal devices.  This option increases the
latency and CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface
as all of the characters sent and received must flow through the
character shunt process.  An explicit device name may not be given if
this option is used.
.TP
.B novj
Disable Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression in both the
transmit and the receive direction.
.TP
.B novjccomp
Disable the connection-ID compression option in Van Jacobson style
TCP/IP header compression.  With this option, pppd will not omit the
connection-ID byte from Van Jacobson compressed TCP/IP headers, nor
ask the peer to do so.
.TP
.B papcrypt
Indicates that all secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file which are
used for checking the identity of the peer are encrypted, and thus
pppd should not accept a password which, before encryption, is
identical to the secret from the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.
.TP
.B pap-max-authreq \fIn
Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B pap-restart \fIn
Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to \fIn\fR
seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B pap-timeout \fIn
Set the maximum time that pppd will wait for the peer to authenticate
itself with PAP to \fIn\fR seconds (0 means no limit).
.TP
.B pass-filter \fIfilter-expression
Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being sent or
received to determine which packets should be allowed to pass.
Packets which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded.  This
option can be used to prevent specific network daemons (such as
routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a very basic firewall
capability.
The \fIfilter-expression\fR syntax is as described for tcpdump(1),
except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
\fBether\fR and \fBarp\fR, are not permitted.  Generally the filter
expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace
in the expression from being interpreted by the shell.  Note that it
is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing
packets using the \fBinbound\fR and \fBoutbound\fR qualifiers. This
option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the
kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).
.TP
.B password \fIpassword-string
Specifies the password to use for authenticating to the peer.  Use
of this option is discouraged, as the password is likely to be visible
to other users on the system (for example, by using ps(1)).
.TP
.B persist
Do not exit after a connection is terminated; instead try to reopen
the connection. The \fBmaxfail\fR option still has an effect on
persistent connections.
.TP
.B plugin \fIfilename
Load the shared library object file \fIfilename\fR as a plugin.  This
is a privileged option.  If \fIfilename\fR does not contain a slash
(/), pppd will look in the \fB/usr/lib/pppd/\fIversion\fR directory
for the plugin, where
\fIversion\fR is the version number of pppd (for example, 2.4.2).
.TP
.B predictor1
Request that the peer compress frames that it sends using Predictor-1
compression, and agree to compress transmitted frames with Predictor-1
if requested.  This option has no effect unless the kernel driver
supports Predictor-1 compression.
.TP
.B privgroup \fIgroup-name
Allows members of group \fIgroup-name\fR to use privileged options.
This is a privileged option.  Use of this option requires care as
there is no guarantee that members of \fIgroup-name\fR cannot use pppd
to become root themselves.  Consider it equivalent to putting the
members of \fIgroup-name\fR in the kmem or disk group.
.TP
.B proxyarp
Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address Resolution Protocol] table
with the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this
system.  This will have the effect of making the peer appear to other
systems to be on the local ethernet.
.TP
.B pty \fIscript
Specifies that the command \fIscript\fR is to be used to communicate
rather than a specific terminal device.  Pppd will allocate itself a
pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal
device.  The \fIscript\fR will be run in a child process with the
pseudo-tty master as its standard input and output.  An explicit
device name may not be given if this option is used.  (Note: if the
\fIrecord\fR option is used in conjuction with the \fIpty\fR option,
the child process will have pipes on its standard input and output.)
.TP
.B receive-all
With this option, pppd will accept all control characters from the
peer, including those marked in the receive asyncmap.  Without this
option, pppd will discard those characters as specified in RFC1662.
This option should only be needed if the peer is buggy.
.TP
.B record \fIfilename
Specifies that pppd should record all characters sent and received to
a file named \fIfilename\fR.  This file is opened in append mode,
using the user's user-ID and permissions.  This option is implemented
using a pseudo-tty and a process to transfer characters between the
pseudo-tty and the real serial device, so it will increase the latency
and CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface.  The
characters are stored in a tagged format with timestamps, which can be
displayed in readable form using the pppdump(8) program.
.TP
.B remotename \fIname
Set the assumed name of the remote system for authentication purposes
to \fIname\fR.
.TP
.B remotenumber \fInumber
Set the assumed telephone number of the remote system for authentication
purposes to \fInumber\fR.
.TP
.B refuse-chap
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the
peer using CHAP.
.TP
.B refuse-mschap
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the
peer using MS-CHAP.
.TP
.B refuse-mschap-v2
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the
peer using MS-CHAPv2.
.TP
.B refuse-eap
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the
peer using EAP.
.TP
.B refuse-pap
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the
peer using PAP.
.TP
.B require-chap
Require the peer to authenticate itself using CHAP [Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication.
.TP
.B require-mppe
Require the use of MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption).  This
option disables all other compression types.  This option enables
both 40\-bit and 128\-bit encryption.  In order for MPPE to successfully
come up, you must have authenticated with either MS-CHAP or MS-CHAPv2.
This option is presently only supported under Linux, and only if your
kernel has been configured to include MPPE support.
.TP
.B require-mppe-40
Require the use of MPPE, with 40\-bit encryption.
.TP
.B require-mppe-128
Require the use of MPPE, with 128\-bit encryption.
.TP
.B require-mschap
Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAP [Microsft Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication.
.TP
.B require-mschap-v2
Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAPv2 [Microsft Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2] authentication.
.TP
.B require-eap
Require the peer to authenticate itself using EAP [Extensible
Authentication Protocol] authentication.
.TP
.B require-pap
Require the peer to authenticate itself using PAP [Password
Authentication Protocol] authentication.
.TP
.B show-password
When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to
show the password string in the log message.
.TP
.B silent
With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a
connection until a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for
the `passive' option with ancient versions of pppd).
.TP
.B sync
Use synchronous HDLC serial encoding instead of asynchronous.
The device used by pppd with this option must have sync support.
Currently supports Microgate SyncLink adapters
under Linux and FreeBSD 2.2.8 and later.
.TP
.B unit \fInum
Sets the ppp unit number (for a ppp0 or ppp1 etc interface name) for outbound
connections.
.TP
.B updetach
With this option, pppd will detach from its controlling terminal once
it has successfully established the ppp connection (to the point where
the first network control protocol, usually the IP control protocol,
has come up).
.TP
.B usehostname
Enforce the use of the hostname (with domain name appended, if given)
as the name of the local system for authentication purposes (overrides
the \fIname\fR option).  This option is not normally needed since the
\fIname\fR option is privileged.
.TP
.B usepeerdns
Ask the peer for up to 2 DNS server addresses.  The addresses supplied
by the peer (if any) are passed to the /etc/ppp/ip-up script in the
environment variables DNS1 and DNS2, and the environment variable
USEPEERDNS will be set to 1.  In addition, pppd will create an
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf file containing one or two nameserver lines with
the address(es) supplied by the peer.
.TP
.B user \fIname
Sets the name used for authenticating the local system to the peer to
\fIname\fR.
.TP
.B vj-max-slots \fIn
Sets the number of connection slots to be used by the Van Jacobson
TCP/IP header compression and decompression code to \fIn\fR, which
must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).
.TP
.B welcome \fIscript
Run the executable or shell command specified by \fIscript\fR before
initiating PPP negotiation, after the connect script (if any) has
completed.  A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be
overridden by a non-privileged user.
.TP
.B xonxoff
Use software flow control (i.e. XON/XOFF) to control the flow of data on
the serial port.
.SH OPTIONS FILES
Options can be taken from files as well as the command line.  Pppd
reads options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and
/etc/ppp/options.\fIttyname\fR (in that order) before processing the
options on the command line.  (In fact, the command-line options are
scanned to find the terminal name before the options.\fIttyname\fR
file is read.)  In forming the name of the options.\fIttyname\fR file,
the initial /dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining
/ characters are replaced with dots.
.PP
An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by
whitespace.  Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the
word in double-quotes (").  A backslash (\\) quotes the following character.
A hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the
line.  There is no restriction on using the \fIfile\fR or \fIcall\fR
options within an options file.
.SH SECURITY
.I pppd
provides system administrators with sufficient access control that PPP
access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users without
fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it's
on.  This control is provided through restrictions on which IP
addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated identity (if
any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged user
may use.  Several of pppd's options are privileged, in particular
those which permit potentially insecure configurations; these options
are only accepted in files which are under the control of the system
administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.
.PP
The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to
use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a
route to that IP address.  For example, a system with a
permanent connection to the wider internet will normally have a
default route, and thus all peers will have to authenticate themselves
in order to set up a connection.  On such a system, the \fIauth\fR
option is the default.  On the other hand, a system where the
PPP link is the only connection to the internet will not normally have
a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address
without authenticating itself.
.PP
As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are privileged,
which means that they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged
user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the
user's ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the \fIfile\fR
option.  Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in
an options file read using the \fIcall\fR option.  If pppd is being
run by the root user, privileged options can be used without
restriction.
.PP
When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user's user ID
or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
specified by the user or the system administrator.  If the device name
comes from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an
options file read using the \fIcall\fR option, pppd uses full root
privileges when opening the device.  Thus, by creating an appropriate
file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow users to
establish a ppp connection via a device which they would not normally
have permission to access.  Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user's
real UID when opening the device.
.SH AUTHENTICATION
Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of
its identity.  This involves the first peer sending its name to the
other, together with some kind of secret information which could only
come from the genuine authorized user of that name.  In such an
exchange, we will call the first peer the "client" and the other the
"server".  The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
server, and the server also has a name by which it identifies itself
to the client.  Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or
password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it
knows that secret.  Very often, the names used for authentication
correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not
essential.
.LP
At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication
Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  PAP
involves the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the
server to authenticate itself.  In contrast, the server initiates the
CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the
challenge packet includes the server's name).  The client must respond
with a response which includes its name plus a hash value derived from
the shared secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows
the secret.
.LP
The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the
other to authenticate itself.  In that case, two separate and
independent authentication exchanges will occur.  The two exchanges
could use different authentication protocols, and in principle,
different names could be used in the two exchanges.
.LP
The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if
requested, and to not require authentication from the peer.  However,
pppd will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol
if it has no secrets which could be used to do so.
.LP
Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets
files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for
CHAP/MS-CHAP/MS-CHAPv2).
Both secrets files have the same format.  The secrets files can
contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other
systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other
systems to itself.
.LP
Each line in a secrets file contains one secret.  A given secret is
specific to a particular combination of client and server - it can
only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that server.
Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3 fields: the name of
the client, the name of the server, and the secret.  These fields may
be followed by a list of the IP addresses that the specified client
may use when connecting to the specified server.
.LP
A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options file, so the
client name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word,
with any embedded spaces or other special characters quoted or
escaped.  Note that case is significant in the client and server names
and in the secret.
.LP
If the secret starts with an `@', what follows is assumed to be the
name of a file from which to read the secret.  A "*" as the client or
server name matches any name.  When selecting a secret, pppd takes the
best match, i.e.  the match with the fewest wildcards.
.LP
Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of
acceptable IP addresses for that client.  If there are only 3 words on
the line, or if the first word is "-", then all IP addresses are
disallowed.  To allow any address, use "*".  A word starting with "!"
indicates that the specified address is \fInot\fR acceptable.  An
address may be followed by "/" and a number \fIn\fR, to indicate a
whole subnet, i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most
significant \fIn\fR bits.  In this form, the address may be followed
by a plus sign ("+") to indicate that one address from the subnet is
authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use.
In this case, the host part of the address will be set to the unit
number plus one.
.LP
Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in authenticating
other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to
others.  When pppd is authenticating the peer (checking the peer's
identity), it chooses a secret with the peer's name in the first
field and the name of the local system in the second field.  The
name of the local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain
name appended if the \fIdomain\fR option is used.  This default can be
overridden with the \fIname\fR option, except when the
\fIusehostname\fR option is used.
.LP
When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the
peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify
itself to the peer.  This name can be specified by the user with the
\fIuser\fR option.  If this option is not used, the name defaults to
the name of the local system, determined as described in the previous
paragraph.  Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first
field and the peer's name in the second field.  Pppd will know the
name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication is being used, because
the peer will have sent it in the challenge packet.  However, if PAP
is being used, pppd will have to determine the peer's name from the
options specified by the user.  The user can specify the peer's name
directly with the \fIremotename\fR option.  Otherwise, if the remote
IP address was specified by a name (rather than in numeric form), that
name will be used as the peer's name.  Failing that, pppd will use the
null string as the peer's name.
.LP
When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is first
compared with the secret from the secrets file.  If the password
doesn't match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and
checked against the secret again.  Thus secrets for authenticating the
peer can be stored in encrypted form if desired.  If the
\fIpapcrypt\fR option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is
omitted, for better security.
.LP
Furthermore, if the \fIlogin\fR option was specified, the username and
password are also checked against the system password database.  Thus,
the system administrator can set up the pap-secrets file to allow PPP
access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses
that each user can use.  Typically, when using the \fIlogin\fR option,
the secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be "", which will match any
password supplied by the peer.  This avoids the need to have the same
secret in two places.
.LP
Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any
other Network Control Protocol) can be started.  If the peer is
required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will
terminated the link (by closing LCP).  If IPCP negotiates an
unacceptable IP address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed.  IP
packets can only be sent or received when IPCP is open.
.LP
In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can't
authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a restricted set of
IP addresses, even when the local host generally requires
authentication.  If the peer refuses to authenticate itself when
requested, pppd takes that as equivalent to authenticating with PAP
using the empty string for the username and password.  Thus, by adding
a line to the pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for
the client and password, it is possible to allow restricted access to
hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.
.SH ROUTING
.LP
When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the
kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface.
This is sufficient to create a host route to the remote end of the
link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets.
Communication with other machines generally requires further
modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution
Protocol) tables.  In most cases the \fIdefaultroute\fR and/or
\fIproxyarp\fR options are sufficient for this, but in some cases
further intervention is required.  The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be
used for this.
.LP
Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the remote
host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the
Internet is through the ppp interface.  The \fIdefaultroute\fR option
causes pppd to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and
delete it when the link is terminated.
.LP
In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a
server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to
communicate with the remote host.  The \fIproxyarp\fR option causes
pppd to look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote
host (an interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a
point-to-point or loopback interface).  If found, pppd creates a
permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host
and the hardware address of the network interface found.
.LP
When the \fIdemand\fR option is used, the interface IP addresses have
already been set at the point when IPCP comes up.  If pppd has not
been able to negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure
the interface (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic
IP address assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses
to the negotiated addresses.  This may disrupt existing connections,
and the use of demand dialing with peers that do dynamic IP address
assignment is not recommended.
.SH MULTILINK
Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links
between a pair of machines into a single `bundle', which appears as a
single virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the
individual links.  Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under
Linux.
.LP
Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same
peer as another link using the peer's endpoint discriminator and the
authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself).  The
endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique
for each peer.  Several types of data can be used, including
locally-assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses,
randomly strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers.  The endpoint
discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint
option.
.LP
In circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a
non-unique value.  The optional bundle option adds an extra string
which is added to the peer's endpoint discriminator and authenticated
identity when matching up links to be joined together in a bundle.
The bundle option can also be used to allow the establishment of
multiple bundles between the local system and the peer.  Pppd uses a
TDB database in /var/run/pppd.tdb to match up links.
.LP
Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to
negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first
link to the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to
the peer and create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network
interface unit.  When another pppd is invoked to bring up another link
to the peer, it will detect the existing bundle and join its link to
it.  Currently, if the first pppd terminates (for example, because of
a hangup or a received signal) the bundle is destroyed.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains
the \fIauth\fR option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the
ppp distribution).
.LP
Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.  This
can be done with a command such as
.IP
pppd call isp
.LP
where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system
administrator to contain something like this:
.IP
ttyS0 19200 crtscts
.br
connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp'
.br
noauth
.LP
In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISP's modem and go
through any logon sequence required.  The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file
contains the script used by chat; it could for example contain
something like this:
.IP
ABORT "NO CARRIER"
.br
ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
.br
ABORT "ERROR"
.br
ABORT "NO ANSWER"
.br
ABORT "BUSY"
.br
ABORT "Username/Password Incorrect"
.br
"" "at"
.br
OK "at&d0&c1"
.br
OK "atdt2468135"
.br
"name:" "^Umyuserid"
.br
"word:" "\\qmypassword"
.br
"ispts" "\\q^Uppp"
.br
"~-^Uppp-~"
.LP
See the chat(8) man page for details of chat scripts.
.LP
Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.  If
the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the
ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run pppd
(installed setuid-root) with a command such as
.IP
pppd proxyarp
.LP
To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP
address for that user's machine and create an entry in
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets (depending on which
authentication method the PPP implementation on the user's machine
supports), so that the user's
machine can authenticate itself.  For example, if Joe has a machine
called "joespc" which is to be allowed to dial in to the machine
called "server" and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you would add an
entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:
.IP
joespc	server	"joe's secret"	joespc.my.net
.LP
Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example) "ppp",
whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp.
Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in
/etc/ppp/.ppprc.
.LP
If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of
wire, you may need to arrange for some control characters to be
escaped.  In particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and
XOFF (^S), using \fIasyncmap a0000\fR.  If the path includes a telnet,
you probably should escape ^] as well (\fIasyncmap 200a0000\fR).  If
the path includes an rlogin, you will need to use the \fIescape ff\fR
option on the end which is running the rlogin client, since many
rlogin implementations are not transparent; they will remove the
sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the
stream.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_RAS.
(This can be overriden by recompiling pppd with the macro
LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.)  See the syslog(8)
documentation for details of where the syslog daemon will write the
messages.  On most systems, the syslog daemon uses the
/etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for syslog
messages.  You may need to edit that file to suit.
.LP
The \fIdebug\fR option causes the contents of all control packets sent
or received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP or IPCP packets.
This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or if
authentication fails.
If debugging is enabled at compile time, the \fIdebug\fR option also
causes other debugging messages to be logged.
.LP
Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal
to the pppd process.  This signal acts as a toggle.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of pppd is set to indicate whether any error was
detected, or the reason for the link being terminated.  The values
used are:
.TP
.B 0
Pppd has detached, or otherwise the connection was successfully
established and terminated at the peer's request.
.TP
.B 1
An immediately fatal error of some kind occurred, such as an essential
system call failing, or running out of virtual memory.
.TP
.B 2
An error was detected in processing the options given, such as two
mutually exclusive options being used.
.TP
.B 3
Pppd is not setuid-root and the invoking user is not root.
.TP
.B 4

.TP
.B 19
We failed to authenticate ourselves to the peer.
.SH SCRIPTS
Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be
used to perform site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are
usually shell scripts, but could be executable code files instead.
Pppd does not wait for the scripts to finish.  The scripts are
executed as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so
that they can do things such as update routing tables or run
privileged daemons.  Be careful that the contents of these scripts do
not compromise your system's security.  Pppd runs the scripts with
standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an
environment that is empty except for some environment variables that
give information about the link.  The environment variables that pppd
sets are:
.TP
.B DEVICE
The name of the serial tty device being used.
.TP
.B IFNAME
The name of the network interface being used.
.TP
.B IPLOCAL
The IP address for the local end of the link.  This is only set when
IPCP has come up.
.TP
.B IPREMOTE
The IP address for the remote end of the link.  This is only set when
IPCP has come up.
.TP
.B PEERNAME
The authenticated name of the peer.  This is only set if the peer
authenticates itself.
.TP
.B SPEED
The baud rate of the tty device.
.TP
.B ORIG_UID
The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd.
.TP
.B PPPLOGNAME
The username of the real user-id that invoked pppd. This is always set.
.P
For the ip-down and auth-down scripts, pppd also sets the following
variables giving statistics for the connection:
.TP
.B CONNECT_TIME
The number of seconds from when the PPP negotiation started until the
connection was terminated.
.TP
.B BYTES_SENT
The number of bytes sent (at the level of the serial port) during the
connection.
.TP
.B BYTES_RCVD
The number of bytes received (at the level of the serial port) during
the connection.
.TP
.B LINKNAME
The logical name of the link, set with the \fIlinkname\fR option.
.TP
.B DNS1
If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set to the
first DNS server address supplied.
.TP
.B DNS2
If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set to the

.SH NOTES
Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd
process by sending it a signal from the list below.
.TP
.B SIGINT, SIGTERM
These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP),
restore the serial device settings, and exit.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the serial
device settings, and close the serial device.  If the \fIpersist\fR or
\fIdemand\fR option has been specified, pppd will try to reopen the
serial device and start another connection (after the holdoff period).
Otherwise pppd will exit.  If this signal is received during the
holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
This signal toggles the state of the \fIdebug\fR option.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression.  This can be
useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result
of a fatal decompression error.  (Fatal decompression errors generally
indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)

.SH NAME
proxymap
\-
Postfix lookup table proxy server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBproxymap\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server provides read-only or read-write
table lookup service to Postfix processes. These services are
implemented with distinct service names: \fBproxymap\fR and
\fBproxywrite\fR, respectively. The purpose of these services is:
.IP \(bu
To overcome chroot restrictions. For example, a chrooted SMTP
server needs access to the system passwd file in order to
reject mail for non-existent local addresses, but it is not
practical to maintain a copy of the passwd file in the chroot
jail.  The solution:
.sp
.nf
local_recipient_maps =
    proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps
.fi
.IP \(bu
To consolidate the number of open lookup tables by sharing
one open table among multiple processes. For example, making
mysql connections from every Postfix daemon process results
in "too many connections" errors. The solution:
.sp
.nf
virtual_alias_maps =
    proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/virtual_alias.cf
.fi
.sp
The total number of connections is limited by the number of
proxymap server processes.
.IP \(bu
To provide single-updater functionality for lookup tables
that do not reliably support multiple writers (i.e. all
file-based tables).
.PP
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server implements the following requests:
.IP "\fBopen\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags\fR"
Open the table with type \fImaptype\fR and name \fImapname\fR,
as controlled by \fIflags\fR. The reply includes the \fImaptype\fR
dependent flags (to distinguish a fixed string table from a regular
expression table).
.IP "\fBlookup\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags key\fR"
Look up the data stored under the requested key.
The reply is the request completion status code and
the lookup result value.
The \fImaptype:mapname\fR and \fIflags\fR are the same
as with the \fBopen\fR request.
.IP "\fBupdate\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags key value\fR"
Update the data stored under the requested key.
The reply is the request completion status code.
The \fImaptype:mapname\fR and \fIflags\fR are the same
as with the \fBopen\fR request.
.sp
To implement single-updater maps, specify a process limit
of 1 in the master.cf file entry for the \fBproxywrite\fR
service.
.sp
This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.
.IP "\fBdelete\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags key\fR"
Delete the data stored under the requested key.
The reply is the request completion status code.
The \fImaptype:mapname\fR and \fIflags\fR are the same
as with the \fBopen\fR request.
.sp
This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.
.IP "\fBsequence\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags function\fR"
Iterate over the specified database. The \fIfunction\fR
is one of DICT_SEQ_FUN_FIRST or DICT_SEQ_FUN_NEXT.
The reply is the request completion status code and
a lookup key and result value, if found.
.sp
This request is supported in Postfix 2.9 and later.
.PP
The request completion status is one of OK, RETRY, NOKEY
(lookup failed because the key was not found), BAD (malformed
request) or DENY (the table is not approved for proxy read
or update access).

There is no \fBclose\fR command, nor are tables implicitly closed
when a client disconnects. The purpose is to share tables among
multiple client processes.
.SH "SERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
\fBproxymap\fR(8) servers run under control by the Postfix
\fBmaster\fR(8)
server.  Each server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.
When all servers are busy while a client connects, the \fBmaster\fR(8)
creates a new \fBproxymap\fR(8) server process, provided that the
process limit is not exceeded.
Each server terminates after serving at least \fB$max_use\fR clients
or after \fB$max_idle\fR seconds of idle time.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server opens only tables that are
approved via the \fBproxy_read_maps\fR or \fBproxy_write_maps\fR
configuration parameters, does not talk to
users, and can run at fixed low privilege, chrooted or not.
However, running the proxymap server chrooted severely limits
usability, because it can open only chrooted tables.

The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server is not a trusted daemon process, and must
not be used to look up sensitive information such as UNIX user or
group IDs, mailbox file/directory names or external commands.

In Postfix version 2.2 and later, the proxymap client recognizes
requests to access a table for security-sensitive purposes,
and opens the table directly. This allows the same main.cf
setting to be used by sensitive and non-sensitive processes.

Postfix-writable data files should be stored under a dedicated
directory that is writable only by the Postfix mail system,
such as the Postfix-owned \fBdata_directory\fR.

In particular, Postfix-writable files should never exist
in root-owned directories. That would open up a particular
type of security hole where ownership of a file or directory
does not match the provider of its content.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server provides service to multiple clients,
and must therefore not be used for tables that have high-latency
lookups.

The \fBproxymap\fR(8) read-write service does not explicitly
close lookup tables (even if it did, this could not be relied on,
because the process may be terminated between table updates).
The read-write service should therefore not be used with tables that
leave persistent storage in an inconsistent state between
updates (for example, CDB). Tables that support "sync on
update" should be safe (for example, Berkeley DB) as should
tables that are implemented by a real DBMS.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
On busy mail systems a long time may pass before
\fBproxymap\fR(8) relevant
changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBdata_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The directory with Postfix-writable data files (for example:
caches, pseudo-random numbers).
.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBproxy_read_maps (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The lookup tables that the \fBproxymap\fR(8) server is allowed to
access for the read-only service.
.PP
Available in Postfix 2.5 and later:
.IP "\fBdata_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"

.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Nd generate the password databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl p | Fl s
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pwd_mkdb
creates
.Xr db 3
style secure and insecure databases for the specified file.
These databases are then installed into
.Pa /etc/spwd.db
and
.Pa /etc/pwd.db ,
respectively.
The file is installed into
.Pa /etc/master.passwd .
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr passwd 5 ) .
It is important to note that the format used in this system is
different from the historic Version 7 style format.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" ==========
.It Fl c
Check if the password file is in the correct format.
Do not change, add, or remove any files.
.\" ==========
.It Fl d Ar directory
Operate in a base directory other than the default of
.Pa /etc .
All absolute paths (including
.Ar file )
will be made relative to
.Ar directory .
Any directories specified as a part of
.Ar file
will be stripped off.
This option is used to create password databases in directories
other than
.Pa etc ;
for instance in a
.Xr chroot 8
jail.
.\" ==========
.It Fl p
Create a Version 7 style password file and install it into
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.\" ==========
.It Fl s
Only update the secure version of the database.
This is most commonly used in conjunction with the
.Fl u
flag during a password change.
Because the insecure database doesn't contain the password there
is no reason to update it if the only change is in the password field.
Cannot be used in conjunction with the
.Fl p
flag.
.\" ==========
.It Fl u Ar username
Only update the record for the specified user.
Utilities that operate on a single user can use this option to avoid the
overhead of rebuilding the entire database.
This option must never be used if the line number of the user's record in
.Pa /etc/master.passwd
has changed.
.\" ==========
.It Ar file
The absolute path to a file in
.Ar master.passwd
format, as described in
.Xr passwd 5 .
.El
.Pp
The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's
encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk
.Pq Sq \&* .
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library password routines (see
.Xr getpwent 3 ) .
.Pp
.Nm pwd_mkdb
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.

.Sh STANDARDS
Previous versions of the system had a program similar to
.Nm pwd_mkdb ,
.Xr mkpasswd ,
which built
.Xr dbm 3
style databases for the password file but depended on the calling programs
to install them.
The program was renamed in order that previous users of the program
not be surprised by the changes in functionality.
.Sh BUGS
Because of the necessity for atomic update of the password files,
.Nm pwd_mkdb
uses
.Xr rename 2
to install them.
This, however, requires that the file specified on the command line live
on the same file system as the
.Pa /etc
directory.
.Pp
There are the obvious races with multiple people running
.Nm pwd_mkdb
on different password files at the same time.
The front-ends to
.Nm pwd_mkdb ,
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.Xr vipw 8
handle the locking necessary to avoid this problem.

.SH NAME
qmgr
\-
Postfix queue manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBqmgr\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon awaits the arrival of incoming mail
and arranges for its delivery via Postfix delivery processes.
The actual mail routing strategy is delegated to the
\fBtrivial-rewrite\fR(8) daemon.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

Mail addressed to the local \fBdouble-bounce\fR address is
logged and discarded.  This stops potential loops caused by
undeliverable bounce notifications.
.SH "MAIL QUEUES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon maintains the following queues:
.IP \fBincoming\fR
Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up by the
local \fBpickup\fR(8) daemon from the \fBmaildrop\fR directory.
.IP \fBactive\fR
Messages that the queue manager has opened for delivery. Only
a limited number of messages is allowed to enter the \fBactive\fR
queue (leaky bucket strategy, for a fixed delivery rate).
.IP \fBdeferred\fR
Mail that could not be delivered upon the first attempt. The queue
manager implements exponential backoff by doubling the time between
delivery attempts.
.IP \fBcorrupt\fR
Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here for inspection.
.IP \fBhold\fR
Messages that are kept "on hold" are kept here until someone
sets them free.
.SH "DELIVERY STATUS REPORTS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon keeps an eye on per-message delivery status
reports in the following directories. Each status report file has
the same name as the corresponding message file:
.IP \fBbounce\fR
Per-recipient status information about why mail is bounced.
These files are maintained by the \fBbounce\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fBdefer\fR
Per-recipient status information about why mail is delayed.
These files are maintained by the \fBdefer\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fBtrace\fR
Per-recipient status information as requested with the
Postfix "\fBsendmail -v\fR" or "\fBsendmail -bv\fR" command.
These files are maintained by the \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon.
.PP
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon is responsible for asking the
\fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemons to
send delivery reports.
.SH "STRATEGIES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The queue manager implements a variety of strategies for
either opening queue files (input) or for message delivery (output).
.IP "\fBleaky bucket\fR"
This strategy limits the number of messages in the \fBactive\fR queue
and prevents the queue manager from running out of memory under
heavy load.
.IP \fBfairness\fR
When the \fBactive\fR queue has room, the queue manager takes one
message from the \fBincoming\fR queue and one from the \fBdeferred\fR
queue. This prevents a large mail backlog from blocking the delivery
of new mail.
.IP "\fBslow start\fR"
This strategy eliminates "thundering herd" problems by slowly
adjusting the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination.
.IP "\fBround robin\fR
The queue manager sorts delivery requests by destination.
Round-robin selection prevents one destination from dominating
deliveries to other destinations.
.IP "\fBexponential backoff\fR"
Mail that cannot be delivered upon the first attempt is deferred.
The time interval between delivery attempts is doubled after each
attempt.
.IP "\fBdestination status cache\fR"
The queue manager avoids unnecessary delivery attempts by
maintaining a short-term, in-memory list of unreachable destinations.
.IP "\fBpreemptive message scheduling\fR"
The queue manager attempts to minimize the average per-recipient delay
while still preserving the correct per-message delays, using
a sophisticated preemptive message scheduling.
.SH "TRIGGERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
On an idle system, the queue manager waits for the arrival of
trigger events, or it waits for a timer to go off. A trigger
is a one-byte message.
Depending on the message received, the queue manager performs
one of the following actions (the message is followed by the
symbolic constant used internally by the software):
.IP "\fBD (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED)\fR"
Start a deferred queue scan.  If a deferred queue scan is already
in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it finishes.
.IP "\fBI (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING)\fR"
Start an incoming queue scan. If an incoming queue scan is already
in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it finishes.
.IP "\fBA (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL)\fR"
Ignore deferred queue file time stamps. The request affects
the next deferred queue scan.
.IP "\fBF (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD)\fR"
Purge all information about dead transports and destinations.
.IP "\fBW (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP)\fR"
Wakeup call, This is used by the master server to instantiate
servers that should not go away forever. The action is to start
an incoming queue scan.
.PP
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon reads an entire buffer worth of triggers.
Multiple identical trigger requests are collapsed into one, and
trigger requests are sorted so that \fBA\fR and \fBF\fR precede
\fBD\fR and \fBI\fR. Thus, in order to force a deferred queue run,
one would request \fBA F D\fR; in order to notify the queue manager
of the arrival of new mail one would request \fBI\fR.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)
RFC 3464 (Delivery status notifications)
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon is not security sensitive. It reads
single-character messages from untrusted local users, and thus may
be susceptible to denial of service attacks. The \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon
does not talk to the outside world, and it can be run at fixed low
privilege in a chrooted environment.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to the syslog daemon.
Corrupted message files are saved to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue
for further inspection.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
A single queue manager process has to compete for disk access with
multiple front-end processes such as \fBcleanup\fR(8). A sudden burst of
inbound mail can negatively impact outbound delivery rates.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are not picked up automatically
as \fBqmgr\fR(8)
is a persistent process. Use the "\fBpostfix reload\fR" command after
a configuration change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

In the text below, \fItransport\fR is the first field in a

Postfix QMQP server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBqmqpd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix QMQP server receives one message per connection.
Each message is piped through the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon, and is placed into the \fBincoming\fR queue as one
single queue file.  The program expects to be run from the
\fBmaster\fR(8) process manager.

The QMQP server implements one access policy: only explicitly
authorized client hosts are allowed to use the service.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The QMQP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to QMQP
clients and to DNS servers on the network. The QMQP server can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The QMQP protocol provides only one server reply per message
delivery. It is therefore not possible to reject individual
recipients.

The QMQP protocol requires the server to receive the entire
message before replying. If a message is malformed, or if any
netstring component is longer than acceptable, Postfix replies
immediately and closes the connection. It is left up to the
client to handle the situation.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"

.Sh NAME
.Nm quotacheck
.Nd filesystem quota consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar filesystem Ar ...
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quotacheck
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default both user and group quotas are checked.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm quotacheck
will check all the read-write filesystems with an existing
mount option file at its root.
The mount option file specifies the types of quotas that
are to be checked.
.It Fl g
Only group quotas are checked. The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.group ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas are checked.  The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.user ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl v
.Nm quotacheck
reports discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
in an identical fashion to
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
Normally
.Nm quotacheck
operates silently.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
expects each filesystem being checked to have
quota data files named
.Pa .quota.user
and/or
.Pa .quota.group
located at the filesystem root.
If a binary data file is not present, 
.Nm quotacheck
will create it.
The default filename and root location cannot be overridden.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
is normally run at 
.Pa fsck
time.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.Nm quotacheck
is running.
.Sh FILES
Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
mounted filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files
whose existence indicates that quotas are to be enabled
for that filesystem. The binary data files will be created by 
quotacheck, if they don't already exist.
.Pp

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to setup and maintain an IPSec tunnel or transport channel, 
between two devices, over which network traffic is conveyed securely. 
This security is made possible by cryptographic keys and operations 
on both devices.
.\"
.Nm
relies on a standardized network protocol (IKE) to automatically 
negotiate and manage the cryptographic keys (e.g. security 
associations) that are necessary for the 
IPSec tunnel or transport channel to function.
.\"
.Nm
speaks the IKE
.Pq ISAKMP/Oakley
key management protocol,
to establish security associations with other hosts.
The SPD
.Pq Security Policy Database
in the kernel usually triggers
.Nm .
.Nm
usually sends all informational messages, warnings and error messages to
.Xr syslogd 8
with the facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON
and the priority
.Dv LOG_INFO .
Debugging messages are sent with the priority
.Dv LOG_DEBUG .
You should configure
.Xr syslog.conf 5
appropriately to see these messages.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
.It Fl 6
Specify the default address family for the sockets.
.It Fl B
Install SA(s) from the file which is specified in
.Xr racoon.conf 5 .
.It Fl d
Increase the debug level.
Multiple
.Fl d
arguments will increase the debug level even more.
.It Fl F
Run
.Nm
in the foreground.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Use
.Ar configfile
as the configuration file instead of the default.
.It Fl L
Include
.Ar file_name:line_number:function_name
in all messages.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Use
.Ar logfile
as the logging file instead of
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.It Fl v
This flag causes the packet dump be more verbose, with higher
debugging level.
.El
.Pp
.Nm

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Ss RAID Levels
When creating a RAID set the user must specify the type of RAID set that they wish to create through the raidlevel argument.
Valid RAID levels are as follows:
.Pp
.Dl J+	Enhanced JBOD
.Pp
.Dl 0	RAID 0 (striping)
.Pp
.Dl 1	RAID 1 (mirroring)
.Pp
.Dl 0+1 RAID 0+1 (mirroring a striped pair)
.Pp
.Dl 5	RAID 5 (striping with distributed parity)
.Pp
Using Enhanced JBOD, you can create a RAID set using a single drive. The resulting RAID set doesnt gain the performance or data protection of the other RAID levels, but it does benefit from the data caching and battery backup provided by the RAID card. An enhanced JBOD set can also be migrated to other RAID sets or moved to another computer that has a Mac Pro or Xserve RAID Card installed.
.Pp
RAID 0 offers improved performance but no data protection. Blocks of data are spread across all of the drives in the RAID set in a process called striping. This allows better performance because file contents move in parallel to and from the individual drives in the set. RAID 0 also provides the most usable disk space; nearly all space on all drives is available for user data. You can create a RAID 0 set using two, three, or four disks.
.Pp
RAID 1 protects data against a drive failure and allows some increase in read performance. Data is protected by duplicating the contents of each drive on a second drive in the set, a process called mirroring. Because of the duplication, a volume based on a RAID 1 cant be larger than half of the total space available on the drives in the set. You can create a RAID 1 set using either two or four disks.
.Pp
RAID 0+1 combines the performance of RAID 0 with the data protection of RAID 1 by mirroring a striped set on a second pair of drives. Because mirroring duplicates all data, this level offers less usable disk space than RAID 5. Usable space is half of the total space available on the drives in the set. You need four disks to create a RAID 0+1 set.
.Pp
RAID 5 is a compromise between the performance of RAID 0 and the data protection of RAID 1. Performance is improved by striping data across the drives in the set. Data protection is provided by parity information that is distributed across the drives. Data can be recovered if any single drive fails. RAID 5 leaves you with more usable space than RAID 1. RAID 5 needs only the equivalent of one drives worth of disk space to store the parity information. You can create a RAID 5 set using either three or four disks.
.Ss Specifying volumes
When performing certain actions, it may be desirable to explicitly specify the group that a volume is built upon.  For example, when
removing a volume, one might want to specify the associated group for clarity.  In these cases, an optional argument is generally available
for this purpose.  An example of this is:
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil delete volume -n myVolume -r theBigRAIDSet
.Pp
A shortcut exists whereby the RAIDSet may be specified as a suffix to the volume name.  For example, this is equivelent to the previous command:
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil delete volume -n myVolume:theBigRAIDSet
.Pp
The RAIDSet name is simply added to the volume name using the colon character as a separator.  This shortcut is supported by all of the
.Qq modify volume
actions.
.\" actions, including the --move action which takes a list of volumes.
.\" For example, the following two commands are equivelent:
.\" .Pp
.\" .Dl # raidutil modify volume --move -n Volume1,Volume2,Volume3 -r theBigRAIDSet -t theNewRAIDSet
.\" .Pp
.\" .Dl # raidutil modify volume --move -n Volume1,Volume2,Volume3:theBigRAIDSet -t theNewRAIDSet
.\" .Pp
.\" In both of these cases, the volumes
.\" .Qq Volume1,
.\" .Qq Volume2,
.\" and
.\" .Qq Volume3,
.\" will be moved from a RAIDSet named
.\" .Qq theBigRAIDSet,
.\" to a group named
.\" .Qq theNewGroup.  Take note that the RAIDSet name suffix must follow the last volume name in the list.  All volumes are assumed to reside upon the same RAIDSet.
.Ss Specifying Sizes
When specifying data that indicates a numeric size, the value will be assumed to be expressed in megabytes (MB) unless otherwise indicated.
.Pp
For our purposes, we will treat all size units as 1000 based numbers.
.Pp
Values may be expressed in bytes by ending the value with the letter
.Qq B .
.Pp
Other units for measure storage space follow suit, as shown by the following table:
.Pp
.br
.Bl -column -offset indent "petabyte (PB) 2^50 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes"
.It Li kilobyte (KB) 2^10 = 1000 bytes
.br
.It Li megabyte (MB) 2^20 = 1000 * 1000 bytes
.br
.It Li gigabyte (GB) 2^30 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes
.br
.It Li terabyte (TB) 2^40 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes
.br
.It Li petabyte (PB) 2^50 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes
.El
.Pp
For the purposes of entering size information to this program, the default units are mebibytes (MiB).  This program will
support values expressed in the following units.  Acceptable abbreviations are listed after the name:
.Pp
.br
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Li kilobyte" Ta ".Li ---" Ta ".Li kilbotye (KB) 2^10"
.It Li one byte = 1B\ \ \  Ta --- Ta B
.br
.It Li kilobyte = 1000B Ta --- Ta K, KB
.br
.It Li megabyte = 1000K Ta --- Ta M, MB
.br
.It Li gigabyte = 1000M Ta --- Ta G, GB
.br
.It Li terabyte = 1000G Ta --- Ta T, TB
.br
.It Li petabyte = 1000T Ta --- Ta P, PB
.El
.Pp
For example, each of
the following commands will all create a volume named
.Qq theVolume
with a size of 600
.Em megabytes ,
on the RAIDSet named
.Qq RAIDSet :
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600000K -r RAIDSet-A
.br
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600 -r RAIDSet
.br
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600M -r RAIDSet
.br
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.6GB -r RAIDSet
.br
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.0006TB -r RAIDSet
.br
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.0000006P -r RAIDSet
.br
.Pp
.Ss Special Size Values For Creating Volumes
In place of a numeric value, the user may provide the word
.Ar "all".
When this is done the program will attempt to use the maximum
valid value.  For example, the following command would create a  volume
named
.Qq BigVolume ,
on the RAIDSet named
.Qq BigRAIDSet ,
using
.Ar all available space
on that RAIDSet:
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n BigVolume -s all -r BigRAIDSet
.br
.Pp
Similarly, the user may provide a value that indicates a percentage of
.Ar available
space.  This
is done by providing a numeric value between 1 and 100 that is followed by the
.Ql %
character.
For example, the following command would create a  volume
named
.Qq BigVolume ,
on the RAIDSet named
.Qq BigRAIDSet ,
using
.Ar all available space
on that RAIDSet:
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n BigVolume -s 100% -r BigRAIDSet
.br
.Pp
The following command would create a  volume
named
.Qq MyVolume ,
on the RAIDSet named
.Qq MyRAIDSet ,
using
.Ar one fifth of all available space
on that RAIDSet:
.Pp
.Dl # raidutil create volume -n MyVolume -s 20% -r MyRAIDSet
.br
.Pp
It should be noted that, all percentage values are rounded down to the nearest whole number.  Thus,
33.333% becomes 33%, and 17.9321% becomes 17%.  Computed values are based on the RAIDSet available
capacity attribute.
.br
.Pp
NOTE:  The use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by IEC, IEEE and CIPM.
The mebibyte and related units are defined in the IEC document
.Ar IEC 60027-1 .

.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd 
.Nd Reverse ARP Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rarpd 
.Op Fl adf
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rarpd
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface.
Upon receiving a request, 
.Nm rarpd
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which 
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and 
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.Pp
Additionally, a request is honored only if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, if the directory 
.Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
exists, where 
.Rm ipaddr
is the target IP address.
.Pp
In normal operation, 
.Nm rarpd
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via 
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If 
.Sq Fl a 
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.
This option implies the 
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.

.Sh NAME
.Nm halt ,
.Nm reboot
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl lnqu
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl lnq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm reboot
utilities flush the file system cache to disk,
send all running processes a
.Dv SIGTERM
(and subsequently a
.Dv SIGKILL )
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the
.Xr wtmp 5
file.
.Pp
When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered off.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
The halt or reboot is
.Em not
recorded in the system log.
This option is intended for applications such as
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
that call
.Nm reboot
or
.Nm halt
and log this themselves.
.It Fl n
The file system cache is not flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl q
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
.Fl n
option is not specified).
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl u
The system is halted up until the point of removing system power, but waits 
before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power. 
This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power on. OS X uses
this mode automatically with supported UPSs in emergency shutdowns.
.El
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom and cleanly terminating
specific programs.
.Sh SIGTERM TO SIGKILL INTERVAL
The
.Dv SIGKILL
will follow the
.Dv SIGTERM
by an intentionally indeterminate period of time.
Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush all dirty data and exit.
Developers are encouraged to file a bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.

.Nd alter priority of running processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar priority
.Op Oo Fl p Oc Ar pid ...
.Op Oo Fl g Oc Ar pgrp ...
.Op Oo Fl u Oc Ar user ...
.Nm
.Fl n Ar increment
.Op Oo Fl p Oc Ar pid ...
.Op Oo Fl g Oc Ar pgrp ...
.Op Oo Fl u Oc Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility alters the
scheduling priority of one or more running processes.
The following
.Ar who
parameters are interpreted as process ID's, process group
ID's, user ID's or user names.
The
.Nm Ns 'ing
of a process group causes all processes in the process group
to have their scheduling priority altered.
The
.Nm Ns 'ing
of a user causes all processes owned by the user to have
their scheduling priority altered.
By default, the processes to be affected are specified by
their process ID's.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl g
Force
.Ar who
parameters to be interpreted as process group ID's.
.It Fl n
Instead of changing the specified processes to the given priority,
interpret the following argument as an increment to be applied to
the current priority of each process.
.It Fl u
Force the
.Ar who
parameters to be interpreted as user names or user ID's.
.It Fl p
Reset the
.Ar who
interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.
.El
.Pp
For example,
.Pp
.Dl "renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32"
.Pp
would change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and
all processes owned by users daemon and root.
.Pp
Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority of
processes they own,
and can only monotonically increase their ``nice value''
within the range 0 to
.Dv PRIO_MAX
(20).
(This prevents overriding administrative fiats.)
The super-user
may alter the priority of any process
and set the priority to any value in the range
.Dv PRIO_MIN
(\-20)
to
.Dv PRIO_MAX .
Useful priorities are:
20 (the affected processes will run at the lowest priority),
0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority),
anything negative (lower values cause more favorable scheduling).

.Dt REVNETGROUP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm revnetgroup
.Nd "generate reverse netgroup data"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl u | h
.Op Fl f Ar netgroup_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes the contents of a file in
.Xr netgroup 5
format into what is called
.Pa reverse netgroup
form.
That is, where the original file shows
netgroup memberships in terms of which members reside in a particular
group, the reverse netgroup format specifies what groups are associated
with a particular member.
This information is used to generate the
.Pa netgroup.byuser
and
.Pa netgroup.byhosts
.Tn NIS
maps.
These reverse netgroup maps are used to help speed up
netgroup lookups, particularly for the
.Fn innetgr
library function.
.Pp
For example, the standard
.Pa /etc/netgroup
file may list a netgroup and a list of its members.
Here, the
netgroup is considered the
.Em key
and the member names are the
.Em data .
By contrast, the reverse
.Pa netgroup.byusers
database lists each unique
member as the key and the netgroups to which the members belong become
the data.
Separate databases are created to hold information pertaining
to users and hosts; this allows netgroup username lookups
and netgroup hostname lookups to be performed using independent keyspaces.
.Pp
By constructing these reverse netgroup databases (and the corresponding
.Tn NIS
maps) in advance, the
.Xr getnetgrent 3
library functions are spared from having to work out the dependencies
themselves on the fly.
This is important on networks with large numbers
of users and hosts, since it can take a considerable amount of time
to process very large netgroup databases.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility prints its results on the standard output.
It is usually called
only by
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile
when rebuilding the
.Tn NIS
netgroup maps.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl u
Generate
.Pa netgroup.byuser
output; only username information in the
original netgroup file is processed.
.It Fl h
Generate
.Pa netgroup.byhost
output; only hostname information in the
original netgroup file is processed.
(Note at least one of the
.Fl u
or
.Fl h
flags must be specified.)
.It Op Fl f Ar netgroup_file
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Pa /etc/netgroup
as its default input file.
The
.Fl f
flag allows the user to specify an alternate input file.
Specifying ``-''
as the input file causes
.Nm
to read from the standard input.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/yp/Makefile -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/Makefile
the Makefile that calls
.Nm yp_mkdb
and
.Nm
to build the
.Tn NIS
databases
.It Pa /etc/netgroup
the default netgroup database file.
This file is most often found
only on the
.Tn NIS
master server

When a service request is received the following protocol
is initiated:
.Bl -enum
.It
The server reads characters from the socket up
to a NUL
.Pq Ql \e0
byte.  The resultant string is
interpreted as an
.Tn ASCII
number, base 10.
.It 
If the number received in step 1 is non-zero,
it is interpreted as the port number of a secondary
stream to be used for the 
.Em stderr .
A second connection is then created to the specified
port on the client's machine.
.It
A NUL terminated user name of at most 16 characters
is retrieved on the initial socket.
.It
A NUL terminated, unencrypted password of at most
16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.  
.It
A NUL terminated command to be passed to a
shell is retrieved on the initial socket.  The length of
the command is limited by the upper bound on the size of
the system's argument list.  
.It
.Nm Rexecd
then validates the user as is done at login time
and, if the authentication was successful, changes
to the user's home directory, and establishes the user
and group protections of the user.
If any of these steps fail the connection is
aborted with a diagnostic message returned.
.It
A NUL byte is returned on the initial socket
and the command line is passed to the normal login
shell of the user.  The
shell inherits the network connections established
by
.Nm rexecd .
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Except for the last one listed below,
all diagnostic messages are returned on the initial socket,
after which any network connections are closed.
An error is indicated by a leading byte with a value of
1 (0 is returned in step 7 above upon successful completion
of all the steps prior to the command execution).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy username too long
The name is
longer than 16 characters.
.It Sy password too long
The password is longer than 16 characters.
.It Sy command too long
The command line passed exceeds the size of the argument
list (as configured into the system).
.It Sy Login incorrect.
No password file entry for the user name existed.
.It Sy Password incorrect.
The wrong password was supplied.
.ne 1i
.It Sy \&No remote directory.
The 
.Xr chdir
command to the home directory failed.
.It Sy Try again.
A
.Xr fork
by the server failed.
.It Sy <shellname>: ...
The user's login shell could not be started.
This message is returned
on the connection associated with the
.Em stderr ,
and is not preceded by a flag byte.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rexec 3
.Sh BUGS
Indicating ``Login incorrect'' as opposed to ``Password incorrect''
is a security breach which allows people to probe a system for users
with null passwords.
.Pp
A facility to allow all data and password exchanges to be encrypted should be
present.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rlogind
.Nd remote login server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rlogind
.Op Fl aln
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rlogind
is the server for the 
.Xr rlogin 1
program.  The server provides a remote login facility
with authentication based on privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm rlogind :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Ask hostname for verification.
.It Fl l
Prevent any authentication based on the user's
.Dq Pa .rhosts
file, unless the user is logging in as the superuser.
.It Fl n
Disable keep-alive messages.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Rlogind
listens for service requests at the port indicated in
the ``login'' service specification; see
.Xr services 5 .
When a service request is received the following protocol
is initiated:
.Bl -enum
.It
The server checks the client's source port.
If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server
aborts the connection.
.It
The server checks the client's source address
and requests the corresponding host name (see
.Xr gethostbyaddr 3 ,
.Xr hosts 5
and
.Xr named 8 ) .
If the hostname cannot be determined,
the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
If the hostname is in the same domain as the server (according to
the last two components of the domain name),
or if the
.Fl a
option is given,
the addresses for the hostname are requested,
verifying that the name and address correspond.
Normal authentication is bypassed if the address verification fails.
.El
.Pp
Once the source port and address have been checked, 
.Nm rlogind
proceeds with the authentication process described in
.Xr rshd 8 .
It then allocates a pseudo terminal (see 
.Xr pty 4 ) ,
and manipulates file descriptors so that the slave
half of the pseudo terminal becomes the 
.Em stdin ,
.Em stdout ,
and
.Em stderr
for a login process.
The login process is an instance of the
.Xr login 1
program, invoked with the
.Fl f
option if authentication has succeeded.
If automatic authentication fails, the user is
prompted to log in as if on a standard terminal line.
.Pp
The parent of the login process manipulates the master side of
the pseudo terminal, operating as an intermediary
between the login process and the client instance of the
.Xr rlogin
program.  In normal operation, the packet protocol described
in
.Xr pty 4
is invoked to provide
.Ql ^S/^Q
type facilities and propagate
interrupt signals to the remote programs.  The login process
propagates the client terminal's baud rate and terminal type,
as found in the environment variable,
.Ql Ev TERM ;
see
.Xr environ 7 .
The screen or window size of the terminal is requested from the client,
and window size changes from the client are propagated to the pseudo terminal.
.Pp
Transport-level keepalive messages are enabled unless the
.Fl n
option is present.
The use of keepalive messages allows sessions to be timed out
if the client crashes or becomes unreachable.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
All initial diagnostic messages are indicated
by a leading byte with a value of 1,
after which any network connections are closed.
If there are no errors before
.Xr login
is invoked, a null byte is returned as in indication of success.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy Try again.
A
.Xr fork
by the server failed.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr ruserok 3 ,
.Xr rshd 8
.Sh BUGS
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
of each client machine and the connecting medium.  This is
insecure, but is useful in an ``open'' environment.
.Pp
A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be
present.
.Pp
A more extensible protocol should be used.

.SH NAME
rotatelogs \- Piped logging program to rotate Apache logs

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
 
.PP
\fBrotatelogs\fR [ -\fBl\fR ] [ -\fBL\fR \fIlinkname\fR ] [ -\fBp\fR \fIprogram\fR ] [ -\fBf\fR ] [ -\fBt\fR ] [ -\fBv\fR ] [ -\fBe\fR ] [ -\fBc\fR ] [ -\fBn\fR \fInumber-of-files\fR ] \fIlogfile\fR \fIrotationtime\fR|\fIfilesize\fR(B|K|M|G) [ \fIoffset\fR ]
 

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
rotatelogs is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped logfile feature\&. It supports rotation based on a time interval or maximum size of the log\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
-l
Causes the use of local time rather than GMT as the base for the interval or for strftime(3) formatting with size-based rotation\&.  
.TP
-L \fIlinkname\fR
Causes a hard link to be made from the current logfile to the specified link name\&. This can be used to watch the log continuously across rotations using a command like tail -F linkname\&.  
.TP
-p \fIprogram\fR
If given, rotatelogs will execute the specified program every time a new log file is opened\&. The filename of the newly opened file is passed as the first argument to the program\&. If executing after a rotation, the old log file is passed as the second argument\&. rotatelogs does not wait for the specified program to terminate before continuing to operate, and will not log any error code returned on termination\&. The spawned program uses the same stdin, stdout, and stderr as rotatelogs itself, and also inherits the environment\&.  
.TP
-f
Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon as rotatelogs starts, instead of waiting for the first logfile entry to be read (for non-busy sites, there may be a substantial delay between when the server is started and when the first request is handled, meaning that the associated logfile does not "exist" until then, which causes problems from some automated logging tools)  
.TP
-t
Causes the logfile to be truncated instead of rotated\&. This is useful when a log is processed in real time by a command like tail, and there is no need for archived data\&. No suffix will be added to the filename, however format strings containing '%' characters will be respected\&.  
.TP
-v
Produce verbose output on STDERR\&. The output contains the result of the configuration parsing, and all file open and close actions\&.  
.TP
-e
Echo logs through to stdout\&. Useful when logs need to be further processed in real time by a further tool in the chain\&.  
.TP
-c
Create log file for each interval, even if empty\&.  
.TP
-n \fInumber-of-files\fR
Use a circular list of filenames without timestamps\&. With -n 3, the series of log files opened would be "logfile", "logfile\&.1", "logfile\&.2", then overwriting "logfile"\&. Available in 2\&.4\&.5 and later\&.  
.TP
\fIlogfile\fR
.PP The path plus basename of the logfile\&. If \fIlogfile\fR includes any '%' characters, it is treated as a format string for strftime(3)\&. Otherwise, the suffix \fI\&.nnnnnnnnnn\fR is automatically added and is the time in seconds (unless the -t option is used)\&. Both formats compute the start time from the beginning of the current period\&. For example, if a rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and second fields created from the strftime(3) format will all be zero, referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour period (midnight)\&. .PP When using strftime(3) filename formatting, be sure the log file format has enough granularity to produce a different file name each time the logs are rotated\&. Otherwise rotation will overwrite the same file instead of starting a new one\&. For example, if \fIlogfile\fR was /var/log/errorlog\&.%Y-%m-%d with log rotation at 5 megabytes, but 5 megabytes was reached twice in the same day, the same log file name would be produced and log rotation would keep writing to the same file\&.  
.TP
\fIrotationtime\fR
The time between log file rotations in seconds\&. The rotation occurs at the beginning of this interval\&. For example, if the rotation time is 3600, the log file will be rotated at the beginning of every hour; if the rotation time is 86400, the log file will be rotated every night at midnight\&. (If no data is logged during an interval, no file will be created\&.)  
.TP
\fIfilesize\fR(B|K|M|G)
The maximum file size in followed by exactly one of the letters B (Bytes), K (KBytes), M (MBytes) or G (GBytes)\&. .PP When time and size are specified, the size must be given after the time\&. Rotation will occur whenever either time or size limits are reached\&.  
.TP
\fIoffset\fR
The number of minutes offset from UTC\&. If omitted, zero is assumed and UTC is used\&. For example, to use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours, specify a value of -300 for this argument\&. In most cases, -l should be used instead of specifying an offset\&.  
 
.SH "EXAMPLES"
 
.nf

     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/log/logfile 86400" common

.fi
 
.PP
This creates the files /var/log/logfile\&.nnnn where nnnn is the system time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it)\&. At the end of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started\&.
 
.nf

     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs -l /var/log/logfile\&.%Y\&.%m\&.%d 86400" common

.fi
 
.PP
This creates the files /var/log/logfile\&.yyyy\&.mm\&.dd where yyyy is the year, mm is the month, and dd is the day of the month\&. Logging will switch to a new file every day at midnight, local time\&.
 
.nf

     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/log/logfile 5M" common

.fi
 
.PP
This configuration will rotate the logfile whenever it reaches a size of 5 megabytes\&.
 
.nf

     ErrorLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/log/errorlog\&.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5M"

.fi
 
.PP
This configuration will rotate the error logfile whenever it reaches a size of 5 megabytes, and the suffix to the logfile name will be created of the form errorlog\&.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS\&.
 
.nf

     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs -t /var/log/logfile 86400" common

.fi
 
.PP
This creates the file /var/log/logfile, truncating the file at startup and then truncating the file once per day\&. It is expected in this scenario that a separate process (such as tail) would process the file in real time\&.
 
.SH "PORTABILITY"
 
.PP
The following logfile format string substitutions should be supported by all strftime(3) implementations, see the strftime(3) man page for library-specific extensions\&.
  
.Ip "\(bu \s-1%A\s0 \- full weekday name (localized)

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnqtv
.Ar command
.Oo
.Op Ar modifiers
.Ar args
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Route
is a utility used to manually manipulate the network
routing tables.  It normally is not needed, as a
system routing table management daemon such as
.Xr routed 8 ,
should tend to this task.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports a limited number of general options,
but a rich command language, enabling the user to specify
any arbitrary request that could be delivered via the
programmatic interface discussed in
.Xr route 4 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Run in debug-only mode, i.e., do not actually modify the routing table.
.It Fl n
Bypass attempts to print host and network names symbolically
when reporting actions.  (The process of translating between symbolic
names and numerical equivalents can be quite time consuming, and
may require correct operation of the network; thus it may be expedient
to forget this, especially when attempting to repair networking operations).
.It Fl t
Run in test-only mode.
.Pa /dev/null
is used instead of a socket.
.It Fl v
(verbose) Print additional details.
.It Fl q
Suppress all output.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides six commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Cm add
Add a route.
.It Cm flush
Remove all routes.
.It Cm delete
Delete a specific route.
.It Cm change
Change aspects of a route (such as its gateway).
.It Cm get
Lookup and display the route for a destination.
.It Cm monitor
Continuously report any changes to the routing information base,
routing lookup misses, or suspected network partitionings.
.El
.Pp
The monitor command has the syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Cm monitor

.Pp
The flush command has the syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Cm flush
.Op Ar family
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Cm flush
command is specified,
.Nm
will ``flush'' the routing tables of all gateway entries.
When the address family may is specified by any of the
.Fl osi ,
.Fl xns ,
.Fl atalk ,
.Fl inet6 ,
or
.Fl inet
modifiers, only routes having destinations with addresses in the
delineated family will be deleted.
.Pp
The other commands have the following syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Ar command
.Op Fl net No \&| Fl host
.Oo Fl ifscope
.Ar boundif
.Oc
.Ar destination gateway
.Op Ar netmask
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar destination
is the destination host or network,
.Ar gateway
is the next-hop intermediary via which packets should be routed.
Routes to a particular host may be distinguished from those to
a network by interpreting the Internet address specified as the
.Ar destination
argument.
The optional modifiers
.Fl net
and
.Fl host
force the destination to be interpreted as a network or a host, respectively.
Otherwise, if the
.Ar destination
has a
.Dq local address part
of
INADDR_ANY
.Pq Li 0.0.0.0 ,
or if the
.Ar destination
is the symbolic name of a network, then the route is
assumed to be to a network; otherwise, it is presumed to be a
route to a host.
Optionally, the
.Ar destination
could also be specified in the
.Ar net Ns / Ns Ar bits
format.
.Pp
For example,
.Li 128.32
is interpreted as
.Fl host Li 128.0.0.32 ;
.Li 128.32.130
is interpreted as
.Fl host Li 128.32.0.130 ;
.Fl net Li 128.32
is interpreted as
.Li 128.32.0.0;
.Fl net Li 128.32.130
is interpreted as
.Li 128.32.130.0;
and
.Li 192.168.64/20
is interpreted as
.Fl net Li 192.168.64 Fl netmask Li 255.255.240.0 .
.Pp
A
.Ar destination
of
.Ar default
is a synonym for
.Fl net Li 0.0.0.0 ,
which is the default route.
.Pp
If the destination is directly reachable
via an interface requiring
no intermediary system to act as a gateway, the
.Fl interface
modifier should be specified;
the gateway given is the address of this host on the common network,
indicating the interface to be used for transmission.
Alternately, if the interface is point to point the name of the interface
itself may be given, in which case the route remains valid even
if the local or remote addresses change.
.Pp
For AF_INET and AF_INET6, the
.Fl ifscope
modifier specifies the additional property of the route related to
the interface scope derived from interface
.Ar boundif .
Such property allows for the presence of multiple route entries with
the same destination, where each route is associated with a unique
interface.  This modifier is required in order to manipulate route
entries marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag.
.Pp
The optional modifier
.Fl link
specify that all subsequent addresses 
are specified as link-level addresses,
and the names must be numeric specifications rather than
symbolic names.
.Pp
The optional
.Fl netmask
modifier is intended
to achieve the effect of an
.Tn OSI
.Tn ESIS
redirect with the netmask option,
or to manually add subnet routes with
netmasks different from that of the implied network interface
(as would otherwise be communicated using the OSPF or ISIS routing protocols).
One specifies an additional ensuing address parameter
(to be interpreted as a network mask).
The implicit network mask generated in the AF_INET case
can be overridden by making sure this option follows the destination parameter.
.Pp
For
.Dv AF_INET6 ,
the
.Fl prefixlen
qualifier
is available instead of the
.Fl mask
qualifier because non-continuous masks are not allowed in IPv6.
For example,
.Fl prefixlen Li 32
specifies network mask of
.Li ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
to be used.
The default value of prefixlen is 64 to get along with
the aggregatable address.
But 0 is assumed if
.Cm default
is specified.
Note that the qualifier works only for
.Dv AF_INET6
address family.
.Pp
Routes have associated flags which influence operation of the protocols
when sending to destinations matched by the routes.
These flags may be set (or sometimes cleared)
by indicating the following corresponding modifiers:
.Bd -literal
-cloning   RTF_CLONING    - generates a new route on use
-xresolve  RTF_XRESOLVE   - emit mesg on use (for external lookup)
-iface    ~RTF_GATEWAY    - destination is directly reachable
-static    RTF_STATIC     - manually added route
-nostatic ~RTF_STATIC     - pretend route added by kernel or daemon
-reject    RTF_REJECT     - emit an ICMP unreachable when matched
-blackhole RTF_BLACKHOLE  - silently discard pkts (during updates)
-proto1    RTF_PROTO1     - set protocol specific routing flag #1
-proto2    RTF_PROTO2     - set protocol specific routing flag #2
-llinfo    RTF_LLINFO     - validly translates proto addr to link addr
.Ed
.Pp
The optional modifiers
.Fl rtt ,
.Fl rttvar ,
.Fl sendpipe ,
.Fl recvpipe ,
.Fl mtu ,
.Fl hopcount ,
.Fl expire ,
and
.Fl ssthresh
provide initial values to quantities maintained in the routing entry
by transport level protocols, such as TCP or TP4.
These may be individually locked by preceding each such modifier to
be locked by
the
.Fl lock
meta-modifier, or one can
specify that all ensuing metrics may be locked by the
.Fl lockrest
meta-modifier.
.Pp
In a
.Cm change
or
.Cm add
command where the destination and gateway are not sufficient to specify
the route (as in the
.Tn ISO
case where several interfaces may have the
same address), the
.Fl ifp
or
.Fl ifa
modifiers may be used to determine the interface or interface address.
.Pp
The optional
.Fl proxy
modifier specifies that the
.Dv RTF_LLINFO
routing table entry is the
.Dq published (proxy-only)
.Tn ARP
entry, as reported by
.Xr arp 8 .
.Pp
All symbolic names specified for a
.Ar destination
or
.Ar gateway
are looked up first as a host name using
.Xr gethostbyname 3 .
If this lookup fails,
.Xr getnetbyname 3
is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.
.Pp
.Nm Route
uses a routing socket and the new message types
.Dv RTM_ADD , RTM_DELETE , RTM_GET ,
and
.Dv RTM_CHANGE .
As such, only the super-user may modify
the routing tables.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "add [host \&| network ] %s: gateway %s flags %x"
The specified route is being added to the tables.  The
values printed are from the routing table entry supplied
in the
.Xr ioctl 2
call.
If the gateway address used was not the primary address of the gateway
(the first one returned by
.Xr gethostbyname 3 ) ,
the gateway address is printed numerically as well as symbolically.
.It "delete [ host \&| network ] %s: gateway %s flags %x"
As above, but when deleting an entry.
.It "%s %s done"
When the
.Cm flush
command is specified, each routing table entry deleted
is indicated with a message of this form.
.It "Network is unreachable"
An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed was not
on a directly-connected network.
The next-hop gateway must be given.
.It "not in table"
A delete operation was attempted for an entry which
wasn't present in the tables.
.It "routing table overflow"
An add operation was attempted, but the system was
low on resources and was unable to allocate memory
to create the new entry.
.It "gateway uses the same route"
A
.Cm change
operation resulted in a route whose gateway uses the
same route as the one being changed.
The next-hop gateway should be reachable through a different route.

.Dt RPC.LOCKD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar debug_level
.Op Fl g Ar grace_period
.Op Fl x Ar host_monitor_cache_period
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides monitored and unmonitored file and record locking services
in an NFS environment.
To monitor the status of hosts requesting locks,
the locking daemon typically operates in conjunction
with
.Xr rpc.statd 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility runs whenever its services are needed to support either the
NFS server (see
.Xr nfsd 8 )
or the NFS client (an NFS file system on which file locking requests
have been made).  The daemon will remain running until a short time
after its services are no longer needed to support either the NFS
client or NFS server.
.Nm
will also make sure that the
.Cm statd
service (on which it depends) is running.
.Pp
The following is a list of command line options that are available.
However, since
.Nm
is normally started by
.Xr launchd 8 ,
configuration of these options should be controlled using the equivalent
settings in the NFS configuration file.  See
.Xr nfs.conf 5
for a list of tunable parameters.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option causes debugging information to be written to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.
These messages are logged with level
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
Specifying a
.Ar debug_level
of 1 results
in the generation of one log line per protocol operation.
Higher
debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.It Fl g
The
.Fl g
option allows to specify the
.Ar grace period
(in seconds).
During the grace period
.Nm
only accepts requests from hosts which are reinitialising locks which
existed before the server restart.
Default is 45 seconds.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option tells rpc.lockd how long to cache state records for monitored hosts.
Setting it to zero will disable the cache which will
make lock and unlock requests from a single client more expensive because
of additional interaction with the client's statd.  The default cache time
is 60 seconds.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level
.Dv LOG_ERR
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /var/run/lockd.pid
The pid of the current
.Cm lockd
daemon.
.It Pa /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.lockd.plist
The
.Cm lockd
service's property list file for
.Xr launchd 8 .
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.statd
.Nd host status monitoring daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Fl n
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl l | Fl L | Fl N Ar hostname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a daemon which cooperates with
.Nm
daemons on other hosts to provide
a status monitoring service.  The daemon accepts requests from
programs running on the local host (typically,
.Xr rpc.lockd 8 ,
the NFS file locking daemon) to monitor the status of specified
hosts.  If a monitored host crashes and restarts, the remote daemon will
notify the local daemon, which in turn will notify the local program(s)
which requested the monitoring service.  Conversely, if this host
crashes and restarts, the
.Cm statd.notify
service will be started to notify all of the hosts which were being
monitored at the time of the crash.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility consists of two
.Xr launchd 8 Ns -controlled
services.  The
.Cm statd.notify
service is run whenever the system needs to notify remote hosts of
a restart.  The
.Cm statd
service is controlled by
.Xr rpc.lockd 8
so that the
.Nm
daemon is running whenever
.Xr rpc.lockd 8
is running.
.Pp
The following is a list of command line options that are available.
Note that since
.Nm
is normally started by
.Xr launchd 8 ,
configuration of these options should be controlled using the equivalent
settings in the NFS configuration file.  See
.Xr nfs.conf 5
for a list of tunable parameters.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Sets the logging level to the maximum.  Note that finer grain control is
available via the
.Cm nfs.statd.verbose
option in
.Xr nfs.conf 5 Ns .
.Pp
Logging is performed via
.Xr syslog 3
using the LOG_DAEMON facility.  By default, only messages up to priority
LOG_WARNING are logged.  Setting the verbose level to one will add
LOG_NOTICE messages which includes logging failed mount attempts.  A
verbose level of two will increase the log level to LOG_INFO which
includes logging successful mount attempts.  A log level of three or
more will add LOG_DEBUG messages and cause increasing amounts of debug
information to be logged.  The debug information exposes lots of
information about
.Nm Ns 's
inner workings which is typically only useful to developers.
Note: the
.Xr syslog 8
configuration may need to be adjusted in order to see the increased
verbosity.
.El
.Pp
The following command line option causes the daemon to run in the
.Cm statd.notify
notification service mode:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Send SM_NOTIFY messages to notify any hosts of a restart.
.El
.Pp
The remaining command line options may be useful for viewing or modifying
the contents of the status file.  They do not start up any daemon or service.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
List each host (and its status) in the status file.
.It Fl L
List each host (and its status) in the status file and then
continue to watch the file and report changes.
.It Fl N
Clear the "needs notification" status for
.Ar hostname
so the
.Cm statd.notify
service will no longer try to notify it.

.Sh BUGS
There is no means for the daemon to tell when a monitored host has
disappeared permanently (eg. catastrophic hardware failure), as opposed
to transient failure of the host or an intermediate router.  At present,
it will pause and re-try notification at frequent intervals for 10
minutes, then hourly, and finally gives up after 24 hours.  The
.Fl N
option may be used to remove the "needs notification" status from such
hosts.
.Pp
The protocol requires that symmetric monitor requests are made to both
the local and remote daemon in order to establish a monitored relationship.
This is convenient for the NFS locking protocol, but probably reduces the
usefulness of the monitoring system for other applications.
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in X/Open CAE Specification

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm Rpcbind
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It is a replacement for the older
.Nm portmap
program.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the original version 2
.Nm portmap
protocol and in addition supports
the newer version 3 and version 4 protocols that are necessary for IPv6 support.
It must be running on the server in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm
what address it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm
on the server machine to determine
the address where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm
is a launchd service. When the first server tries to register with
.Nm
the
.Tn RPC
library will contact launchd and arrange for rpcbind to be started.
Note it is no longer possible to run rpcbind from the command line.
.Nm
logs errors and information using
.Xr asl 3 .
.Nm
uses
.Xr hosts_access 5
for access control; note
access control patterns may only reference IP addresses.
.Pp
The following options are available and will need to be added to the
.Nm
plist file.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
causes
.Nm
errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output
via asl_log. This option is no longer
very useful.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose logging of access control checks.
.It Fl h
Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP requests.
This option
may be specified multiple times and is typically necessary when running
on a multi-homed host.
If no
.Fl h
option is specified,
.Nm
will bind to
.Dv INADDR_ANY ,
which could lead to problems on a multi-homed host due to
.Nm
returning a UDP packet from a different IP address than it was
sent to.
Note that when specifying IP addresses with
.Fl h ,
.Nm
will automatically add
.Li 127.0.0.1
to the list.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rpcinfo
makes an
.Tn RPC
call to an
.Tn RPC
server and reports what it finds. Unless otherwise specified or
noted below the default
.Nm rpcbind
protocol version is 3.
With no or only generic options, call
the
.Nm rpcbind
dump procedure on the specified 
.Ar host
or
.Dq localhost
if
.Ar host
is not specified and display the results.
For versions 3 and 4 display the program number, 
the version, the 
.Dq netid ,
the universal address that the services is listening on,
symbolic name of the program if known, and then the 
owner that registered the 
.Aq program, version, netid, address
tuple.
For version 2 of the protocol list the program, version, protocol, port, and symbolic program name.
.Em See the \*[Fll summary] option below for a typically more useful output.
.Nm rpcbind
defaults the 
.Ar netid
to
.Dq tcp
for the dump procedure.
.Pp
The
.Ar program
argument can be either a name or a number.
.Pp
If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the specified program.  Otherwise, if the version is optional
.Nm rpcinfo
attempts to find all the registered version numbers for the specified program by calling version 0 (which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number instead) and attempts to call each registered version.
.Pp
A required transport option is needed for the second and third lines
of the synopsis which is used to ping, i.e.\&, call the null procedure of the specified program and version. The results will be
displayed on stdout. If version is not specified each valid version found as described above will be called.
The third synopsis will use the supplied universal address over the transport specified by
.Ar netid
to call the null procedure of the specified
.Ar program
in the same manner as above. In addition the last two lines of the synopsis can
.Dq ping
the server as described in the 
.Nm Legacy Options
section below.
.Sh GENERIC OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It \*[Fll rpcbvers] Ar version
Attempt to use the supplied
.Nm rpcbind
.Ar version.
Note some options below
are version specific and this option may be ignored. If specifying version 2
.Pq Nm portmapper ,
.Ar netid
below must be one of 
.Dq udp 
or
.Dq tcp .
.It Fl T Ar netid
Specify the netid to use. Supported netids are 
.Dq udp ,
.Dq tcp ,
.Dq udp6 ,
and
.Dq tcp6 .
.It \*[Fll timeout] Ar seconds 
Timeout used in creating client handles and the client calls
to
.Nm rpcbind.
Current default is 12 seconds.

.Nm rpcbind
calls. They are compatible with older versions of 
.Nm rpcinfo .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Bro Fl p \*(Ba \*[Fls portmap] Brc Oo Fl T Ar netid Oc Op Ar host
Probe the portmapper on

and print a list of all registered
.Tn RPC
programs.  If
.Ar host
is not specified, it defaults to the value
.Dq localhost .
.It Bro Fl u \*(Ba \*[Fls udpping] Brc Ar host Ar program Op Ar version
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to the
.Tn NULL
procedure of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn UDP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Bro Fl t \*(Ba \*[Fls tcpping] Brc Ar host Ar program Op Ar version
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to the
.Tn NULL
procedure of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn TCP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Bro Fl n \*(Ba \*[Fls portnum] Brc Ar portnum
Use
.Ar portnum
as the port number for the
.Fl t
and
.Fl u
options instead of the port number given by the portmapper.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Bro Fl b \*(Ba \*[Fls broadcast] Brc Ar program Ar version
Make an
.Tn RPC
multicast over
.Tn INET6
to the 
.Tn RPCB_MULTICAST_ADDR ,
.Dq FF02::202 ,
and broadcast over
.Tn INET
using
.Tn UDP
to procedure 0 of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
and report all hosts that respond.
.Nm rpcifno
will first use
.Tn RPCBIND
version 3
and then call the broadcast procedure of the
.Nm portmapper
protocol to collect older hosts. There is a reply cache
kept so duplicates will not be returned unless the cache fills.
.Pp
Note that the
.Fl b
option by its self is compatible with the older
.Nm portmapper .
However, specifying 
\*[Fll rpcbvers] 2
will short circuit the
.Nm rpcbind
version 3 calls and only call the
.Nm portmapper .
.It Bro Fl d \*(Ba \*[Fls delete] Brc Oo Fl T Ar netid Oc Ar program Ar version
Delete registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version .
If the 
.Ar netid
is specified, only unregister the 
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
over that transport.
This option can be exercised only by the super-user or the user who
registered the the
.Tn RPC
service.
.It \*[Fll getaddr] Oo Fl T Ar netid Oc Oo Ar host Oc Ar program Ar version
Get the universal address that the client can use to contact the
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
from
.Ar host
over 
.Ar netid .
If host is not specified
.Ar localhost
is assumed. If
.Ar netid
is not specified
.Dq udp
is assumed. If the specified
.Ar version
is not available but some other version is,
return the universal address for one of those versions of the program.
.It \*[Fll getversaddr] Oo Fl T Ar netid Oc Oo Ar host Oc Ar program Ar version
Get the universal address that the client can use to contact the 
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
from
.Ar host
over
.Ar netid .
If host is not specified 
.Ar localhost
is assumed. If
.Ar netid
is not specified
.Dq udp
is assumed. If the version is not available then that will be indicated. This requires the remote
.Nm rpcbind
support version\ 4.
.It Fl h
Print out the synopsis of this program.
.It \*[Fll help]
Print out the synopsis and an explanation of the options.
.It \*[Fll indirect] Oo Fl T Ar netid Oc Oo Ar host Oc Ar program Ar version
Send a indirect call to the null procedure of
.Ar program
and
.Ar version

.Nm rpcsvchost
.Nd hosting environment for DCE/RPC services
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Cm options
.Ar service
.Op Ar service ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a very simple environment for hosting DCE/RPC services.
It loads DCE/RPC services from the list of plugins given as arguments,
binds to an appropriate set of endpoints and listens for protocol requests.
.Pp
If
.Ar service
is not a relative file name, it is assumed to be the name of a dylib located in
.Pa /usr/lib/rpcsvc .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed
.It Fl debug, nodebug
.Nm
will log debug information and may perform extra
diagnostic checks. This option is typically only useful for debugging.
.It Fl endpoints Ar BINDING Op ,BINDING
This argument specifies additional endpoints that
.Nm
should attempt to bind.
.Ar BINDING
must be a comma-separated list of DCE/RPC binding strings that include both the
protocol sequence and endpoint fields.
.It Fl help
Prints a usage message and exits.
.\" The following requests should be uncommented and used where appropriate.
.It Fl launchd, nolaunchd
Normally,
.Nm
attempts to bind all the well-known endpoints specified by the service plugins.
If there are no well-known endpoints, it will bind new endpoints on all
supported protocol sequences. The
.Fl launchd
option disables this behavior and causes
.Nm
to check in with
.Xr launchd 8
to obtain a set of sockets to bind as protocol endpoints.
.Pp
Launchd sockets vended to
.Nm
must be named with the appropriate DCE/RPC protocol sequence (eg. "ncacn_np").
.It Fl sandbox, nosandbox
When this option is specified, the modules loaded by
.Nm
will be run in a sandbox.
.Nm
will attempt to intialize the sandbox using the sandbox profile with the name 
com.apple.<module-name>.sb. See
.Xr sandbox 7 
for an overview of the sandbox facility.
.It Fl register, noregister
When this option is specified,
.Nm
attempts to register the loaded services with the DCE/RPC endpoint mapper.
.It Fl stdout
Causes
.Nm
to print log messages to standard output instead of the system log.
.It Fl wait-for-debugger
Causes
.Nm
to wait for a debugger to attach after it has loaded and initialized its
plugins. This is useful for debugging instances of
.Nm
that are launched by
.Xr launchd 8 .

.Sh NAME
.Nm rshd
.Nd remote shell server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aDLln
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is the server for the
.Xr rcmd 3
routine and, consequently, for the
.Xr rsh 1
utility.
The server provides remote execution facilities
with authentication based on privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility listens for service requests at the port indicated in
the
.Dq cmd
service specification; see
.Xr services 5 .
When a service request is received the following protocol
is initiated:
.Bl -enum
.It
The server checks the client's source port.
If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server
aborts the connection.
.It
The server reads characters from the socket up
to a
.Tn NUL
(`\e0') byte.
The resultant string is
interpreted as an
.Tn ASCII
number, base 10.
.It
If the number received in step 2 is non-zero,
it is interpreted as the port number of a secondary
stream to be used for the
.Em stderr .
A second connection is then created to the specified
port on the client's machine.
The source port of this
second connection is also in the range 512-1023.
.It
The server checks the client's source address
and requests the corresponding host name (see
.Xr gethostbyaddr 3 ,
.Xr hosts 5
and
.Xr named 8 ) .
If the hostname cannot be determined or the hostname and address do
not match after verification,
the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
.It
A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters
is retrieved on the initial socket.
This user name
is interpreted as the user identity on the
.Em client Ns 's
machine.
.It
A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters
is retrieved on the initial socket.
This user name
is interpreted as a user identity to use on the
.Em server Ns 's
machine.
.It
A null terminated command to be passed to a
shell is retrieved on the initial socket.
The length of
the command is limited by the upper bound on the size of
the system's argument list.
.It
The
.Nm
utility then validates the user using
.Xr ruserok 3 ,
which uses the file
.Pa /etc/hosts.equiv
and the
.Pa .rhosts
file found in the user's home directory.
The
.Fl l
option prevents
.Xr ruserok 3
from doing any validation based on the user's
.Pa .rhosts
file,
unless the user is the superuser.
.It
If the file 
.Pa /etc/nologin
exists and the user is not the superuser,
the connection is closed.
.It
A
.Tn NUL
byte is returned on the initial socket
and the command line is passed to the normal login
shell of the user.
The
shell inherits the network connections established
by
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
This flag is ignored, and is present for compatability purposes.
.It Fl D
Sets the TCP_NODELAY socket option, which improves the performance
of small back-to-back writes at the expense of additional network
traffic.
.It Fl L
Causes all successful accesses to be logged to
.Xr syslogd 8
as
.Li auth.info
messages.
.It Fl l
Do not use the user's
.Pa .rhosts
file for authentication, unless the user is the superuser.
.It Fl n
Turn off transport level keepalive messages.
This will prevent sessions
from timing out if the client crashes or becomes unreachable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/nologin -compact

.Nm

Authentication modules requiring passwords (such as
.Nm pam_unix )
are not supported.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Except for the last one listed below,
all diagnostic messages
are returned on the initial socket,
after which any network connections are closed.
An error is indicated by a leading byte with a value of
1 (0 is returned in step 10 above upon successful completion
of all the steps prior to the execution of the login shell).
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy Locuser too long.
The name of the user on the client's machine is
longer than 16 characters.
.It Sy Ruser too long.
The name of the user on the remote machine is
longer than 16 characters.
.It Sy Command too long.
The command line passed exceeds the size of the argument
list (as configured into the system).
.It Sy Login incorrect.
No password file entry for the user name existed
or the authentication procedure described above failed.
.It Sy Remote directory.
The
.Xr chdir 2
function to the home directory failed.
./".It Sy Logins not available right now.
./" The
./" .Xr rsh 1
./" utility was attempted outside the allowed hours defined in
./" .Pa /etc/login.conf

.It Sy Can't make pipe.
The pipe needed for the
.Em stderr ,
was not created.
.It Sy Can't fork; try again.
A
.Xr fork 2
by the server failed.
.It Sy <shellname>: ...
The user's login shell could not be started.
This message is returned
on the connection associated with the
.Em stderr ,
and is not preceded by a flag byte.

The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
of each client machine and the connecting medium.
This is
insecure, but is useful in an
.Dq open
environment.

A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be
present.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rtadvd
.Nd router advertisement daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dDfMRs
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl F Ar dumpfile
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Ar interface ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends router advertisement packets to the specified
.Ar interfaces .
.Pp
The program will daemonize itself on invocation.
It will then send router advertisement packets periodically, as well
as in response to router solicitation messages sent by end hosts.
.Pp
Router advertisements can be configured on a per-interface basis, as
described in
.Xr rtadvd.conf 5 .
.Pp
If there is no configuration file entry for an interface,
or if the configuration file does not exist altogether,
.Nm
sets all the parameters to their default values.
In particular,
.Nm
reads all the interface routes from the routing table and advertises
them as on-link prefixes.
.Pp
.Nm
also watches the routing table.
If an interface direct route is
added on an advertising interface and no static prefixes are
specified by the configuration file,
.Nm
adds the corresponding prefix to its advertising list.
.Pp
Similarly, when an interface direct route is deleted,
.Nm
will start advertising the prefixes with zero valid and preferred
lifetimes to help the receiving hosts switch to a new prefix when
renumbering.
Note, however, that the zero valid lifetime cannot invalidate the
autoconfigured addresses at a receiving host immediately.
According to the specification, the host will retain the address
for a certain period, which will typically be two hours.
The zero lifetimes rather intend to make the address deprecated,
indicating that a new non-deprecated address should be used as the
source address of a new connection.
This behavior will last for two hours.
Then
.Nm
will completely remove the prefix from the advertising list,
and succeeding advertisements will not contain the prefix information.
.Pp
Moreover, if the status of an advertising interface changes,
.Nm
will start or stop sending router advertisements according
to the latest status.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option may be used to disable this behavior;
.Nm
will not watch the routing table and the whole functionality described
above will be suppressed.
.Pp
Basically, hosts MUST NOT send Router Advertisement messages at any
time (RFC 2461, Section 6.2.3).
However, it would sometimes be useful to allow hosts to advertise some
parameters such as prefix information and link MTU.
Thus,
.Nm
can be invoked if router lifetime is explicitly set zero on every
advertising interface.
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl c
Specify an alternate location,
.Ar configfile ,
for the configuration file.
By default,
.Pa /etc/rtadvd.conf
is used.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode (useful when debugging).
Log messages will be dumped to stderr when this option is specified.
.It Fl F
Specify an alternative file in which to dump internal states when
.Nm
receives signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 .
The default is
.Pa /var/run/rtadvd.dump .
.It Fl M
Specify an interface to join the all-routers site-local multicast group.
By default,
.Nm
tries to join the first advertising interface appearing on the command
line.
This option has meaning only with the
.Fl R
option, which enables routing renumbering protocol support.
.It Fl p
Specify an alternative file in which to store the process ID.
The default is
.Pa /var/run/rtadvd.pid.
.It Fl R
Accept router renumbering requests.
If you enable it, certain IPsec setup is suggested for security reasons.
This option is currently disabled, and is ignored by
.Nm
with a warning message.
.It Fl s
Do not add or delete prefixes dynamically.
Only statically configured prefixes, if any, will be advertised.
.El
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/rtadvd.dump
or the file specified with option
.Fl F .
.Pp
Use
.Dv SIGTERM
to kill
.Nm
gracefully.
In this case,
.Nm
will transmit router advertisement with router lifetime 0
to all the interfaces
.Pq in accordance with RFC2461 6.2.5 .
.Sh FILES

dumps its internal state.

.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in the WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Sh BUGS
There used to be some text that recommended users not to let
.Nm
advertise Router Advertisement messages on an upstream link to avoid
undesirable
.Xr icmp6 4
redirect messages.
However, based on the later discussion in the IETF ipng working group,
all routers should rather advertise the messages regardless of
the network topology, in order to ensure reachability.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the daemon program to send ICMPv6 Router Solicitation messages
on the specified interfaces.
If a node (re)attaches to a link,
.Nm
sends some Router Solicitations on the link destined to the link-local scope
all-routers multicast address to discover new routers
and to get non link-local addresses.
.Pp
.Nm
should be used on IPv6 hosts
(non-router nodes)
only.
.Pp
If you invoke the program as
.Nm rtsol ,
it will transmit probes from the specified
.Ar interface ,
without becoming a daemon.
In other words,
.Nm rtsol
behaves as
.Do
.Nm
.Fl f1
.Ar interfaces
.Dc .
.Pp
Specifically,
.Nm
sends at most 3 Router Solicitations on an interface
after one of the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Just after invocation of
.Nm
daemon.
.It
The interface is up after a temporary interface failure.
.Nm
detects such failures by periodically probing to see if the status
of the interface is active or not.
Note that some network cards and drivers do not allow the extraction
of link state.
In such cases,
.Nm
cannot detect the change of the interface status.
.It
Every 60 seconds if the
.Fl m
option is specified and the
.Nm
daemon cannot get the interface status.
This feature does not conform to the IPv6 neighbor discovery
specification, but is provided for mobile stations.
The default interval for router advertisements, which is on the order of 10
minutes, is slightly long for mobile stations.
This feature is provided
for such stations so that they can find new routers as soon as possible
when they attach to another link.
.El
.Lp
Once
.Nm
has sent a Router Solicitation, and has received a valid Router Advertisement,
it refrains from sending additional solicitations on that interface, until
the next time one of the above events occurs.
.Lp
When sending a Router Solicitation on an interface,
.Nm
includes a Source Link-layer address option if the interface
has a link-layer address.
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/rtsold.dump .
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a

will exit with error.

If this option is specified,
.Nm
sends probing packets to default routers that have advertised Router

Moreover, if the option is specified,

command, which first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Nm rtsol
is now integrated into
.Xr rtsold 8 .
.\"
.Sh BUGS
In some operating systems, when a PCMCIA network card is removed
and reinserted, the corresponding interface index is changed.
However,
.Nm
assumes such changes will not occur, and always uses the index that
it got at invocation. As a result,
.Nm
may not work if you reinsert a network card.
In such a case,
.Nm
should be killed and restarted.
.Pp
The IPv6 autoconfiguration specification assumes a single-interface host.
You may see kernel error messages if you try to autoconfigure a host with
multiple interfaces.
Also, it seems contradictory for
.Nm
to accept multiple
.Ar interface
arguments.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rwhod
.Nd system status server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl m Op Ar ttl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is the server which maintains the database used by the
.Xr rwho 1
and
.Xr ruptime 1
programs.
Its operation is predicated on the ability to
.Em broadcast
or
.Em multicast
messages on a network.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility operates as both a producer and consumer of status information,
unless the
.Fl l
(listen mode) option is specified, in which case
it acts as a consumer only.
As a producer of information it periodically
queries the state of the system and constructs
status messages which are broadcasted or multicasted on a network.
As a consumer of information, it listens for other
.Nm
servers' status messages, validating them, then recording
them in a collection of files located in the directory
.Pa /var/rwho .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i
Enable insecure mode, which causes
.Nm
to ignore the source port on incoming packets.
.It Fl p
Ignore all
.Dv POINTOPOINT
interfaces.
This is useful if you do not wish to keep dial on demand
interfaces permanently active.
.It Fl l
Enable listen mode, which causes
.Nm
to not broadcast any information.
This allows you to monitor other machines'
.Nm
information, without broadcasting your own.
.It Fl m Op Ar ttl
Cause
.Nm
to use IP multicast (instead of
broadcast) on all interfaces that have
the IFF_MULTICAST flag set in their "ifnet" structs
(excluding the loopback interface).
The multicast
reports are sent with a time-to-live of 1, to prevent
forwarding beyond the directly-connected subnet(s).
.Pp
If the optional
.Ar ttl
argument is supplied with the
.Fl m
flag,
.Nm
will send IP multicast datagrams with a
time-to-live of
.Ar ttl ,
via a SINGLE interface rather
than all interfaces.
.Ar ttl
must be between 0 and
32 (or MAX_MULTICAST_SCOPE).
Note that
.Fl m Ar 1
is different from
.Fl m ,
in that
.Fl m Ar 1
specifies transmission on one interface only.
.Pp
When
.Fl m
is used without a
.Ar ttl
argument, the program accepts multicast
.Nm
reports from all multicast-capable interfaces.
If a
.Ar ttl
argument is given, it accepts multicast reports from only one interface, the
one on which reports are sent (which may be controlled via the host's routing
table).
Regardless of the
.Fl m
option, the program accepts broadcast or
unicast reports from all interfaces.
Thus, this program will hear the
reports of old, non-multicasting
.Nm Ns s ,
but, if multicasting is used,
those old
.Nm Ns s
will not hear the reports generated by this program.
.El
.Pp
The server transmits and receives messages at the port indicated
in the ``who'' service specification; see
.Xr services 5 .
The messages sent and received, are of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct	outmp {
	char	out_line[8];		/* tty name */
	char	out_name[8];		/* user id */
#ifdef __LP64__
	int	out_time;		/* time on */
#else /* !__LP64__ */
	long	out_time;		/* time on */
#endif /* __LP64__ */
};

struct	whod {
	char	wd_vers;
	char	wd_type;
	char	wd_fill[2];
	int	wd_sendtime;
	int	wd_recvtime;
	char	wd_hostname[32];
	int	wd_loadav[3];
	int	wd_boottime;
	struct	whoent {
		struct	outmp we_utmp;
		int	we_idle;
	} wd_we[1024 / sizeof (struct whoent)];
};
.Ed
.Pp
All fields are converted to network byte order prior to
transmission.
The load averages are as calculated by the
.Xr w 1
program, and represent load averages over the 5, 10, and 15 minute
intervals prior to a server's transmission; they are multiplied by 100
for representation in an integer.
The host name
included is that returned by the
.Xr gethostname 3
system call, with any trailing domain name omitted.
The array at the end of the message contains information about
the users logged in to the sending machine.
This information
includes the contents of the
.Xr utmpx 5
entry for each non-idle terminal line and a value indicating the
time in seconds since a character was last received on the terminal line.
.Pp
Messages received by the
.Nm rwho
server are discarded unless they originated at an
.Nm rwho
server's port or the
.Fl i
option was specified.
In addition, if the host's name, as specified
in the message, contains any unprintable
.Tn ASCII
characters, the
message is discarded.
Valid messages received by
.Nm
are placed in files named
.Pa whod.hostname
in the directory
.Pa /var/rwho .
These files contain only the most recent message, in the
format described above.
.Pp
Status messages are generated approximately once every
3 minutes.
The
.Nm
utility performs an
.Xr nlist 3
on
.Pa /boot/kernel/kernel
every 30 minutes to guard against
the possibility that this file is not the system
image currently operating.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
There should be a way to relay status information between networks. 
Status information should be sent only upon request rather than continuously.
People often interpret the server dying

.Sh NAME
.Nm sa
.Nd print system accounting statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abcdDfijkKlmnqrstu
.Op Fl P Ar file
.Op Fl U Ar file
.Op Fl v Ar cutoff
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reports on, cleans up,
and generally maintains system
accounting files.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is able to condense the information in
.Pa /var/account/acct
into the summary files
.Pa /var/account/savacct
and
.Pa /var/account/usracct ,
which contain system statistics according
to command name and login id, respectively.
This condensation is desirable because on a
large system,
.Pa /var/account/acct
can grow by hundreds of blocks per day.
The summary files are normally read before
the accounting file, so that reports include
all available information.
.Pp
If file names are supplied, they are read instead of
.Pa /var/account/acct .
After each file is read, if the summary
files are being updated, an updated summary will
be saved to disk.
Only one report is printed,
after the last file is processed.
.Pp
The labels used in the output indicate the following, except
where otherwise specified by individual options:
.Bl -tag -width k*sec
.It Dv avio
Average number of I/O operations per execution
.It Dv cp
Sum of user and system time, in minutes
.It Dv cpu
Same as
.Dv cp
.It Dv k
CPU-time averaged core usage, in 1k units
.It Dv k*sec
CPU storage integral, in 1k-core seconds
.It Dv re
Real time, in minutes
.It Dv s
System time, in minutes
.It Dv tio
Total number of I/O operations
.It Dv u
User time, in minutes
.El
.Pp
The options to
.Nm
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
List all command names, including those containing unprintable
characters and those used only once.
By default,
.Nm
places all names containing unprintable characters and
those used only once under the name ``***other''.
.It Fl b
If printing command statistics, sort output by the sum of user and system
time divided by number of calls.
.It Fl c
In addition to the number of calls and the user, system and real times
for each command, print their percentage of the total over all commands.
.It Fl d
If printing command statistics, sort by the average number of disk
I/O operations.
If printing user statistics, print the average number of
disk I/O operations per user.
.It Fl D
If printing command statistics, sort and print by the total number
of disk I/O operations.
.It Fl f
Force no interactive threshold comparison with the
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl i
Do not read in the summary files.
.It Fl j
Instead of the total minutes per category, give seconds per call.
.It Fl k
If printing command statistics, sort by the cpu-time average memory
usage.
If printing user statistics, print the cpu-time average
memory usage.
.It Fl K
If printing command statistics, print and sort by the cpu-storage integral.
.It Fl l
Separate system and user time; normally they are combined.
.It Fl m
Print per-user statistics rather than per-command statistics.
.It Fl n
Sort by number of calls.
.It Fl P Ar file
Use the specified
.Ar file
for accessing the per-command accounting summary database,
instead of the default
.Pa /var/account/savacct .
.It Fl q
Create no output other than error messages.
.It Fl r
Reverse order of sort.
.It Fl s
Truncate the accounting files when done and merge their data
into the summary files.
.It Fl t
For each command, report the ratio of real time to the sum
of user and system cpu times.
If the cpu time is too small to report, ``*ignore*'' appears in
this field.
.It Fl U Ar file
Use the specified
.Ar file
for accessing the per-user accounting summary database,
instead of the default
.Pa /var/account/usracct .
.It Fl u
Superseding all other flags, for each entry
in the accounting file, print the user ID, total seconds of cpu usage,
total memory usage, number of I/O operations performed, and
command name.
.It Fl v Ar cutoff
For each command used
.Ar cutoff
times or fewer, print the command name and await a reply
from the terminal.
If the reply begins with ``y'', add
the command to the category ``**junk**''.
This flag is
used to strip garbage from the report.
.El
.Pp
By default, per-command statistics will be printed.
The number of
calls, the total elapsed time in minutes, total cpu and user time
in minutes, average number of I/O operations, and CPU-time
averaged core usage will be printed.
If the
.Fl m
option is specified, per-user statistics will be printed, including
the user name, the number of commands invoked, total cpu time used
(in minutes), total number of I/O operations, and CPU storage integral
for each user.
If the
.Fl u
option is specified, the uid, user and system time (in seconds),
CPU storage integral, I/O usage, and command name will be printed
for each entry in the accounting data file.
.Pp
If the
.Fl u
flag is specified, all flags other than
.Fl q
are ignored.
If the
.Fl m
flag is specified, only the
.Fl b ,
.Fl d ,
.Fl i ,
.Fl k ,
.Fl q ,
and
.Fl s
flags are honored.

.Sh CAVEATS
While the behavior of the options in this version of
.Nm
was modeled after the original version, there are some intentional
differences and undoubtedly some unintentional ones as well.
In
particular, the
.Fl q
option has been added, and the
.Fl m
option now understands more options than it used to.
.Pp
The formats of the summary files created by this version of
.Nm
are very different from the those used by the original version.
This is not considered a problem, however, because the accounting record
format has changed as well (since user ids are now 32 bits).

.Sh BUGS
The number of options to this program is absurd, especially considering
that there is not much logic behind their lettering.
.Pp
The field labels should be more consistent.
.Pp
The VM system does not record the CPU storage integral.

tool is used to collect cumulative system activity data.
The sample system data is collected at intervals
.Ar t
seconds apart, in a loop
.Ar n
times.
The binary sample data is written to
.Ar ofile
if specified.
Otherwise, the binary data is written to stdout.
If the
.Ar ofile 
file does not exist, it is created, otherwise it is truncated.

.Nm sadc
is intended to be used as the engine behind the
.Nm sar(1)
command, and is not typically invoked on the command line.
Two shell scripts,
.Nm sa1
and

are provided to drive the typical sampling, saving, and
reporting process.

.Sh OPTIONS
The following options modify the way data is collected by
.Nm sadc .
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list 
.It Fl m Ar mode
Modify the collection of system statistics as specified by
.Ar mode .
Currently only one mode is supported.
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list
.It PPP
By default, the collection of ppp network interface statistics
is turned off.
This is because the number of ppp connections can be very high, 
causing the raw data file to grow unexpectedly large,
especially  when samples are collected at short intervals.  
Use the
.Ar PPP
mode to turn the collection back on.
.El

.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
/usr/lib/sa/sadc 15 20 /tmp/sample.out
.Pp
This call collects 20 samples at 15 second intervals.

.ad
.fi
.SH NAME
scache
\-
Postfix shared connection cache server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBscache\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBscache\fR(8) server maintains a shared multi-connection
cache. This information can be used by, for example, Postfix
SMTP clients or other Postfix delivery agents.

The connection cache is organized into logical destination
names, physical endpoint names, and connections.

As a specific example, logical SMTP destinations specify
(transport, domain, port), and physical SMTP endpoints
specify (transport, IP address, port).  An SMTP connection
may be saved after a successful mail transaction.

In the general case, one logical destination may refer to
zero or more physical endpoints, one physical endpoint may
be referenced by zero or more logical destinations, and
one endpoint may refer to zero or more connections.

The exact syntax of a logical destination or endpoint name
is application dependent; the \fBscache\fR(8) server does
not care.  A connection is stored as a file descriptor together
with application-dependent information that is needed to
re-activate a connection object. Again, the \fBscache\fR(8)
server is completely unaware of the details of that
information.

All information is stored with a finite time to live (ttl).
The connection cache daemon terminates when no client is
connected for \fBmax_idle\fR time units.

This server implements the following requests:
.IP "\fBsave_endp\fI ttl endpoint endpoint_properties file_descriptor\fR"
Save the specified file descriptor and connection property data
under the specified endpoint name. The endpoint properties
are used by the client to re-activate a passivated connection
object.
.IP "\fBfind_endp\fI endpoint\fR"
Look up cached properties and a cached file descriptor for the
specified endpoint.
.IP "\fBsave_dest\fI ttl destination destination_properties endpoint\fR"
Save the binding between a logical destination and an
endpoint under the destination name, together with destination
specific connection properties. The destination properties
are used by the client to re-activate a passivated connection
object.
.IP "\fBfind_dest\fI destination\fR"
Look up cached destination properties, cached endpoint properties,
and a cached file descriptor for the specified logical destination.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBscache\fR(8) server is not security-sensitive. It does not
talk to the network, and it does not talk to local users.
The \fBscache\fR(8) server can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

The \fBscache\fR(8) server is not a trusted process. It must
not be used to store information that is security sensitive.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The session cache cannot be shared among multiple machines.

When a connection expires from the cache, it is closed without
the appropriate protocol specific handshake.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically as \fBscache\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.SH "RESOURCE CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBconnection_cache_ttl_limit (2s)\fR"
The maximal time-to-live value that the \fBscache\fR(8) connection
cache server
allows.
.IP "\fBconnection_cache_status_update_time (600s)\fR"
How frequently the \fBscache\fR(8) server logs usage statistics with
connection cache hit and miss rates for logical destinations and for
physical endpoints.
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that "smtpd" becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".

.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar new-location-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides access to the system configuration sets, commonly referred to as
.Qq locations .
When invoked with no arguments,
.Nm
displays the names and associated identifiers for each defined
.Qq location
and indicates which is currently active.
.Nm
also allows the user to select or change the active
.Qq location
by specifying its name or identifier.
Changing the
.Qq location
causes an immediate system re-configuration, unless the
.Fl n
option is supplied.
.Pp
At present, the majority of preferences associated with a
.Qq location
relate to the system's network configuration.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl n
Delay changing the system's
.Qq location
until the next system boot (or the next time that the system configuration
preferences are changed).
.It Ar new-location-name
If not specified, a list of the available
.Qq location
names and associated identifiers will be reported on standard output.
If specified, this argument is matched with the
.Qq location
names and identifiers and the matching set is activated.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Invoked with no options,
.Nm
provides a command line interface to the
.Qq dynamic store
data maintained by
.Xr configd 8 .
Interaction with this data (using the SystemConfiguration.framework
SCDynamicStore APIs) is handled with a set of commands read from
standard input.
A list of the available commands is available by entering the
.Ar help
directive.
.Pp
The
.Fl -prefs
option provides a command line interface to the [raw] stored
preference data.
Interaction with this data (using the SystemConfiguration.framework
SCPreferences APIs) is handled with a set of commands read from
standard input.
A list of the available commands is availble by entering the
.Ar help
directive.
.Pp
The
.Fl r
option provides a means of checking the network reachability of a host, an IP
address, or a pair of local and remote IP addresses.
Network
.Qq reachability
is a term that indicates whether network communication is possible between
the current host and the specified host.
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option provides a means of checking for (and optionally waiting for the
creation of or posting of a notification to) a dynamic store key.
.Pp
The
.Fl -get
and
.Fl -set
options provide a means of reporting and updating a select group of
persistent system preferences.
.Pp
The
.Fl -dns
option reports the current DNS configuration.
The first listed
.Xr resolver 5
configuration is considered to be the
.Qq default
configuration.
Additional
.Qq supplemental
configurations follow.  Those containing a
.Qq domain
name will be used for queries matching the specified domain.
Those without will be used as a
.Qq default
configuration in addition to the first listed.
.Pp
The
.Fl -proxy
option reports the current system proxy configuration.
.Pp
The
.Fl -nc
option provides a set of commands for monitoring and interacting with VPN connections.
Use
.Fl -nc
.Ar help
for a full list of commands.
.\".Pp
.\"Lastly, the
.\".Fl -net
.\"option provides a means of managing the system's network configuration.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl r Oo Fl W Oc Bro "" Ar nodename | Ar address | Ar local-address remote-address "" Brc
Check the network reachability of the specified host name, IP address, or a
pair of local and remote IP addresses.
One or more of the following strings will be reported to standard output.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Transient Connection"
.It Not Reachable
The specified nodename/address cannot be reached using the current network
configuration.
.It Reachable
The specified nodename/address can be reached using the current network
configuration.
.It Transient Connection
The specified nodename/address can be reached via a transient (e.g. PPP)
connection.
.It Connection Required
The specified nodename/address can be reached using the current network
configuration but a connection must first be established.
As an example, this status would be returned for a dialup connection
that was not currently active but could handle network traffic for the
target system.
.It Connection Automatic
The specified nodename/address can be reached using the current network
configuration but a connection must first be established.
Any traffic directed to the specified name/address will initiate the
connection.
.It Local Address
The specified nodename/address is one associated with a network interface
on the system.
.It Directly Reachable Addresss
Network traffic to the specified nodename/address will not go through a
gateway but is routed directly to one of the interfaces on the system.
.El
.Pp
The reachability can also be monitored by specifying the
.Fl W
(watch) option.
This will result in the current status being reported as well as the
status when/if the network configuration changes.
.Pp
A zero exit status will be returned when the reachability status is reported correctly.
A non-zero exit status will be returned if errors are detected with an error reported to standard error.
.It Fl w Ar dynamic-store-key Op Fl t Ar timeout
Check if the specified key exists in the
.Qq dynamic store
data maintained by
.Xr configd 8 .
If present,
.Nm
will return with a zero exit status.
If not present,
.Nm
will wait for the specified time for data to be associated with or a notification
to be posted using the key.
A non-zero exit status will be returned if the key was not created/posted
within the specified time.
.Pp
.Nm
will wait indefinitely if a timeout of 0 seconds is specified.
The default timeout is 15 seconds.
.It Fl -get Ar pref
Retrieves the specified preference.  The current value will be reported on standard output.
.Pp
Supported preferences include:
.Bl -tag -width "LocalHostName" -offset indent
.It ComputerName
The user-friendly name for the system.
.It LocalHostName
The local (Bonjour) host name.
.It HostName
The name associated with
.Xr hostname 1
and
.Xr gethostname 3 .
.El
.It Fl -set Ar pref Op Ar newval
Updates the specified preference with the new value.
If the new value is not specified on the command line then it will be read from standard input.
.Pp
Supported preferences include:
ComputerName
LocalHostName
HostName
.Pp
The
.Fl -set
option requires super-user access.
.It Fl -dns
Reports the current DNS configuration.
.It Fl -proxy
Reports the current proxy configuration.
.It Fl -nc Ar nc-arguments
Provides a set of commands for monitoring and interacting with VPN connections. Use
.Fl -nc

Security Parameter Index
.Pq SPI
for the SAD and the SPD.
.Ar spi
must be a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number with a
.Dq Li 0x
prefix.
SPI values between 0 and 255 are reserved for future use by IANA
and cannot be used.
TCP-MD5 associations must use 0x1000 and therefore only have per-host
granularity at this time.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar extensions
take some of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.\"
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify a security protocol mode for use.
.Ar mode
is one of following:
.Li transport , tunnel ,
or
.Li any .
The default value is
.Li any .
.\"
.It Fl r Ar size
Specify window size of bytes for replay prevention.
.Ar size
must be decimal number in 32-bit word.
If
.Ar size
is zero or not specified, replay checks don't take place.
.\"
.It Fl u Ar id
Specify the identifier of the policy entry in the SPD.
See
.Ar policy .
.\"
.It Fl f Ar pad_option
defines the content of the ESP padding.
.Ar pad_option
is one of following:
.Bl -tag -width random-pad -compact
.It Li zero-pad
All the paddings are zero.
.It Li random-pad
A series of randomized values are used.
.It Li seq-pad
A series of sequential increasing numbers started from 1 are used.
.El

Specify an encryption algorithm
.Ar ealgo
for ESP.
.It Xo
.Fl E Ar ealgo Ar key
.Fl A Ar aalgo Ar key
.Xc
Specify an encryption algorithm
.Ar ealgo ,
as well as a payload authentication algorithm
.Ar aalgo ,
for ESP.
.It Fl A Ar aalgo Ar key
Specify an authentication algorithm for AH.
.It Fl C Ar calgo Op Fl R
Specify a compression algorithm for IPComp.
If
.Fl R
is specified, the
.Ar spi
field value will be used as the IPComp CPI
.Pq compression parameter index
on wire as-is.
If
.Fl R
is not specified,
the kernel will use well-known CPI on wire, and
.Ar spi
field will be used only as an index for kernel internal usage.
.El
.Pp
.Ar key
must be a double-quoted character string, or a series of hexadecimal
digits preceded by
.Dq Li 0x .
.Pp
Possible values for
.Ar ealgo ,
.Ar aalgo ,
and
.Ar calgo
are specified in the
.Sx Algorithms
sections.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar src_range
.It Ar dst_range
These select the communications that should be secured by IPsec.
They can be an IPv4/v6 address or an IPv4/v6 address range, and
may be accompanied by a TCP/UDP port specification.
This takes the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset
.Ar address
.Ar address/prefixlen
.Ar address[port]
.Ar address/prefixlen[port]
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar prefixlen
and
.Ar port
must be decimal numbers.
The square brackets around
.Ar port
are really necessary,
they are not man page meta-characters.
For FQDN resolution, the rules applicable to
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
apply here as well.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar upperspec
Upper-layer protocol to be used.
You can use one of the words in
.Pa /etc/protocols
as
.Ar upperspec ,
or
.Li icmp6 ,
.Li ip4 ,
or
.Li any .
.Li any
stands for
.Dq any protocol .
You can also use the protocol number.
You can specify a type and/or a code of ICMPv6 when the
upper-layer protocol is ICMPv6.
The specification can be placed after
.Li icmp6 .
A type is separated from a code by single comma.
A code must always be specified.
When a zero is specified, the kernel deals with it as a wildcard.
Note that the kernel can not distinguish a wildcard from an ICPMv6
type of zero.
For example, the following means that the policy doesn't require IPsec
for any inbound Neighbor Solicitation.
.Dl spdadd ::/0 ::/0 icmp6 135,0 -P in none ;
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Ar upperspec
does not work against forwarding case at this moment,
as it requires extra reassembly at the forwarding node
.Pq not implemented at this moment .
There are many protocols in
.Pa /etc/protocols ,
but all protocols except of TCP, UDP, and ICMP may not be suitable
to use with IPsec.
You have to consider carefully what to use.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar policy
.Ar policy
is in one of the following three formats:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.It Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li discard
.It Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li none
.It Xo Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li ipsec
.Ar protocol/mode/src-dst/level Op ...
.Xc
.Ed
.Pp
You must specify the direction of its policy as
.Ar direction .
Either
.Ar out ,
.Ar in ,
or
.Ar fwd
can be used.
.Pp
.Ar priority specification
is used to control the placement of the policy within the SPD.
Policy position is determined by
a signed integer where higher priorities indicate the policy is placed
closer to the beginning of the list and lower priorities indicate the
policy is placed closer to the end of the list.
Policies with equal priorities are added at the end of groups
of such policies.
.Pp
Priority can only
be specified when setkey has been compiled against kernel headers that
support policy priorities (Linux \*[Gt]= 2.6.6).
If the kernel does not support priorities, a warning message will
be printed the first time a priority specification is used.
Policy priority takes one of the following formats:
.Bl -tag  -width "discard"
.It Xo
.Ar {priority,prio} offset
.Xc
.Ar offset
is an integer in the range from \-2147483647 to 214783648.
.It Xo
.Ar {priority,prio} base {+,\-} offset
.Xc
.Ar base
is either
.Li low (\-1073741824) ,
.Li def (0) ,
or
.Li high (1073741824)
.Pp
.Ar offset
is an unsigned integer.
It can be up to 1073741824 for
positive offsets, and up to 1073741823 for negative offsets.
.El
.Pp
.Li discard
means the packet matching indexes will be discarded.
.Li none
means that IPsec operation will not take place onto the packet.
.Li ipsec
means that IPsec operation will take place onto the packet.
.Pp
The
.Ar protocol/mode/src-dst/level
part specifies the rule how to process the packet.
Either
.Li ah ,
.Li esp ,
or
.Li ipcomp
must be used as
.Ar protocol .
.Ar mode
is either
.Li transport
or
.Li tunnel .
If
.Ar mode
is
.Li tunnel ,
you must specify the end-point addresses of the SA as
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
with
.Sq -
between these addresses, which is used to specify the SA to use.
If
.Ar mode
is
.Li transport ,
both
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
can be omitted.
.Ar level
is to be one of the following:
.Li default , use , require ,
or
.Li unique .
If the SA is not available in every level, the kernel will
ask the key exchange daemon to establish a suitable SA.
.Li default
means the kernel consults the system wide default for the protocol
you specified, e.g. the
.Li esp_trans_deflev
sysctl variable, when the kernel processes the packet.
.Li use
means that the kernel uses an SA if it's available,
otherwise the kernel keeps normal operation.
.Li require
means SA is required whenever the kernel sends a packet matched
with the policy.
.Li unique
is the same as
.Li require ;
in addition, it allows the policy to match the unique out-bound SA.
You just specify the policy level
.Li unique ,
.Xr racoon 8
will configure the SA for the policy.
If you configure the SA by manual keying for that policy,
you can put a decimal number as the policy identifier after
.Li unique
separated by a colon
.Sq \&:
like:
.Li unique:number
in order to bind this policy to the SA.
.Li number
must be between 1 and 32767.
It corresponds to
.Ar extensions Fl u
of the manual SA configuration.
When you want to use SA bundle, you can define multiple rules.
For example, if an IP header was followed by an AH header followed
by an ESP header followed by an upper layer protocol header, the
rule would be:
.Dl esp/transport//require ah/transport//require ;
The rule order is very important.
.Pp
When NAT-T is enabled in the kernel, policy matching for ESP over
UDP packets may be done on endpoint addresses and port
(this depends on the system.
System that do not perform the port check cannot support
multiple endpoints behind the same NAT).
When using ESP over UDP, you can specify port numbers in the endpoint
addresses to get the correct matching.
Here is an example:
.Bd -literal -offset
spdadd 10.0.11.0/24[any] 10.0.11.33/32[any] any -P out ipsec
    esp/tunnel/192.168.0.1[4500]-192.168.1.2[30000]/require ;

.Ed
These ports must be left unspecified (which defaults to 0) for
anything other than ESP over UDP.
They can be displayed in SPD dump using
.Nm
.Fl DPp .
.Pp
Note that
.Dq Li discard
and
.Dq Li none
are not in the syntax described in
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3 .
There are a few differences in the syntax.
See
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3
for detail.

.Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol
to stdout and expects client requests from stdin.
.Nm
is not intended to be called directly, but from
.Xr sshd 8
using the
.Cm Subsystem
option.
.Pp
Command-line flags to
.Nm
should be specified in the
.Cm Subsystem
declaration.
See
.Xr sshd_config 5
for more information.
.Pp
Valid options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar start_directory
specifies an alternate starting directory for users.
The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime:
%% is replaced by a literal '%',
%d is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated,
and %u is replaced by the username of that user.
The default is to use the user's home directory.
This option is useful in conjunction with the
.Xr sshd_config 5
.Cm ChrootDirectory
option.
.It Fl e
Causes
.Nm
to print logging information to stderr instead of syslog for debugging.
.It Fl f Ar log_facility
Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages from
.Nm .
The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
The default is AUTH.
.It Fl h
Displays
.Nm
usage information.
.It Fl l Ar log_level
Specifies which messages will be logged by
.Nm .
The possible values are:
QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that
.Nm
performs on behalf of the client.
DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.
DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.
The default is ERROR.
.It Fl P Ar blacklisted_requests
Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are banned by
the server.
.Nm
will reply to any blacklisted request with a failure.
The
.Fl Q
flag can be used to determine the supported request types.
If both a blacklist and a whitelist are specified, then the blacklist is
applied before the whitelist.
.It Fl p Ar whitelisted_requests
Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are permitted
by the server.
All request types that are not on the whitelist will be logged and replied
to with a failure message.
.Pp
Care must be taken when using this feature to ensure that requests made
implicitly by SFTP clients are permitted.
.It Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
Query protocol features supported by
.Nm .
At present the only feature that may be queried is
.Dq requests ,
which may be used for black or whitelisting (flags
.Fl P
and
.Fl p
respectively).
.It Fl R
Places this instance of
.Nm
into a read-only mode.
Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations that change
the state of the filesystem, will be denied.
.It Fl u Ar umask
Sets an explicit
.Xr umask 2
to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the
user's default mask.
.El
.Pp
On some systems,
.Nm
must be able to access
.Pa /dev/log
for logging to work, and use of
.Nm
in a chroot configuration therefore requires that
.Xr syslogd 8
establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm showmount
.Op Fl Ae36
.Op Fl a | d
.Op Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm showmount
shows status information about the
.Tn NFS
server on
.Ar host .
By default it prints the names of all hosts that have
.Tn NFS
file systems mounted
on the host. See
.%T "NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094,
Appendix A,
and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I,
for a detailed description of the protocol.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Search for NFS servers advertised via Bonjour.
.It Fl a
List all mount points in the form:
.Ar host : Ns Ar dirpath
.It Fl d
List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.
.It Fl e
Show the
.Ar host Ns 's
exports list.
.It Fl 3
Use mount protocol Version 3, compatible with NFS Version 3.
.It Fl 6
Use only IPv6 addresses to contact servers.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 1 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr mDNSResponder 8
.Sh BUGS
The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual mounts,
since the
.Tn NFS
server is stateless.
.Nm
will only display the information
as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBshowq\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon reports the Postfix mail queue status.
It is the program that emulates the sendmail `mailq' command.

The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon can also be run in stand-alone mode
by the superuser. This mode of operation is used to emulate
the `mailq' command while the Postfix mail system is down.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon can run in a chroot jail at fixed low
privilege, and takes no input from the client. Its service port
is accessible to local untrusted users, so the service can be
susceptible to denial of service attacks.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon does not interact with the
outside world.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically as \fBshowq\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The recipient of mail addressed to the null address.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"

.Dt SHUTDOWN 8

.Sh NAME
.Nm shutdown
.Nd "close down the system at a given time"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm shutdown
.Op Fl
.Oo
.Fl h 
.Op Fl u
|
.Fl r | Fl s | Fl k
.Oc
.Oo
.Fl o
.Op Fl n
.Oc
.Ar time
.Op Ar warning-message ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm shutdown
utility provides an automated shutdown procedure for super-users
to nicely notify users when the system is shutting down,
saving them from system administrators, hackers, and gurus, who
would otherwise not bother with such niceties.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
The system is halted at the specified
.Ar time .
.It Fl k
Kick everybody off.
The
.Fl k
option
does not actually halt the system, but leaves the
system multi-user with logins disabled (for all but super-user).
.It Fl n
If the
.Fl o
is specified, prevent the file system cache from being flushed by passing
.Fl n
option to
.Xr halt 8
or
.Xr reboot 8 .
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl o
If
.Fl h
or
.Fl r
is specified,
.Nm shutdown
will execute
.Xr halt 8
or
.Xr reboot 8
instead of sending a signal to
.Xr launchd 8 .
.It Fl r
The system is rebooted at the specified
.Ar time .
.It Fl s
The system is put to sleep at the specified
.Ar time .
.It Fl u
The system is halted up until the point of removing system power, but waits 
before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power. 
This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power on. OS X uses
this mode automatically with supported UPSs in emergency shutdowns.
.It Ar time
.Ar Time
is the time at which
.Nm shutdown
will bring the system down and
may be the word
.Ar now
(indicating an immediate shutdown) or
specify a future time in one of two formats:
.Ar +number ,
or
.Ar yymmddhhmm ,
where the year, month, and day may be defaulted
to the current system values.  The first form brings the system down in
.Ar number
minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.
.It Ar warning-message
Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broadcast
to users currently logged into the system.
.It Fl
If
.Sq Fl
is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from the standard
input.
.El
.Pp
At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches
and starting at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed
on the terminals of all users logged in.
.Pp
At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the
time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason.
Corresponding signal is then sent to
.Xr launchd 8
to respectively halt, reboot or bring the system down to single-user state
(depending on the above options).
.Pp
A scheduled shutdown can be canceled by killing the
.Nm shutdown
process (a
.Dv SIGTERM
should suffice).
.Sh SIGTERM TO SIGKILL INTERVAL
Upon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL.
The
.Dv SIGKILL
will follow the
.Dv SIGTERM
by an intentionally indeterminate period of time.
Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush all dirty data and exit.
Developers are encouraged to file a bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kill 1 ,
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr wall 1 ,
.Xr halt 8 ,
.Xr launchd 8 ,
.Xr reboot 8
.Sh BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
The hours and minutes in the second time format may be separated by
a colon (``:'') for backward compatibility.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm shutdown
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .

do not fetch the entry from the database.
In this case, if the entry does not exist, a fake entry with the

option is used, with no attributes.
As a consequence, those rules that depend on the contents 
of the target object will not behave as with the real object.
The

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapadd
is used to add entries specified in LDAP Directory Interchange Format
(LDIF) to a
.BR slapd (8)
database.
It opens the given database determined by the database number or
suffix and adds entries corresponding to the provided LDIF to
the database.
Databases configured as
.B subordinate
of this one are also updated, unless \fB\-g\fP is specified.
The LDIF input is read from standard input or the specified file.

All files eventually created by
.BR slapadd
will belong to the identity
.BR slapadd
is run as, so make sure you either run
.BR slapadd
with the same identity
.BR slapd (8)
will be run as (see option
.B \-u
in
.BR slapd (8)),
or change file ownership before running
.BR slapd (8).

Note: slapadd will also perform the relevant indexing whilst adding the database if
any are configured. For specfic details, please see 
.BR slapindex (8).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-b \ suffix 
Use the specified \fIsuffix\fR to determine which database to
add entries to.  The \fB\-b\fP cannot be used in conjunction
with the
.B \-n
option.
.TP
.B \-c
enable continue (ignore errors) mode.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the
default config directory will be made before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored. If dry-run mode is also specified,
no conversion will occur.
.TP
.B \-g
disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).
.TP
.BI \-j \ lineno
Jump to the specified line number in the LDIF file before processing
any entries. This allows a load that was aborted due to errors in the
input LDIF to be resumed after the errors are corrected.
.TP
.BI \-l \ ldif-file
Read LDIF from the specified file instead of standard input.
.TP
.BI \-n \ dbnum
Add entries to the \fIdbnum\fR-th database listed in the
configuration file.  The
.B \-n
cannot be used in conjunction with the
.B \-b
option.
To populate the config database
.BR slapd\-config (5),
use 
.B \-n 0
as it is always the first database. It must physically exist
on the filesystem prior to this, however.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-user=<user>   (see `\-l' in slapd(8))

              schema-check={yes|no}
              value-check={yes|no}

.in
The \fIschema\-check\fR option toggles schema checking (default on);
the \fIvalue\-check\fR option toggles value checking (default off).
The latter is incompatible with \fB-q\fR.
.TP
.B \-q
enable quick (fewer integrity checks) mode.  Does fewer consistency checks
on the input data, and no consistency checks when writing the database.
Improves the load time but if any errors or interruptions occur the resulting
database will be unusable.
.TP
.B \-s
disable schema checking.  This option is intended to be used when loading
databases containing special objects, such as fractional objects on a
partial replica.  Loading normal objects which do not conform to
schema may result in unexpected and ill behavior.
.TP
.BI \-S \ SID
Server ID to use in generated entryCSN.  Also used for contextCSN
if \fB\-w\fP is set as well.  Defaults to \fB0\fP.
.TP
.B \-u
enable dry-run (don't write to backend) mode.
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.TP
.BI \-w
write syncrepl context information.
After all entries are added, the contextCSN
will be updated with the greatest CSN in the database.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Your
.BR slapd (8)
should not be running 
when you do this to ensure consistency of the database.
.LP
.B slapadd 
may not provide naming or schema checks.  It is advisable to
use
.BR ldapadd (1)
when adding new entries into an existing directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
To import the entries specified in file
.B ldif
into your
.BR slapd (8)
database give the command:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	/usr/sbin/slapadd \-l ldif

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapcat
is used to generate an LDAP Directory Interchange Format
(LDIF) output based upon the contents of a
.BR slapd (8)
database.
It opens the given database determined by the database number or
suffix and writes the corresponding LDIF to standard output or
the specified file.
Databases configured as
.B subordinate
of this one are also output, unless \fB\-g\fP is specified.
.LP
The entry records are presented in database order, not superior first
order.  The entry records will include all (user and operational)
attributes stored in the database.  The entry records will not include
dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry).
.LP
The output of slapcat is intended to be used as input to
.BR slapadd (8).
The output of slapcat cannot generally be used as input to
.BR ldapadd (1)
or other LDAP clients without first editing the output.
This editing would normally include reordering the records
into superior first order and removing no-user-modification
operational attributes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a \ filter
Only dump entries matching the asserted filter.
For example

slapcat \-a \\
    "(!(entryDN:dnSubtreeMatch:=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com))"

will dump all but the "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" subtree
of the "dc=example,dc=com" database.
Deprecated; use \fB-H\fP \fIldap:///???(filter)\fP instead.
.TP
.BI \-b \ suffix 
Use the specified \fIsuffix\fR to determine which database to
generate output for.  The \fB\-b\fP cannot be used in conjunction
with the
.B \-n
option.
.TP
.B \-c
Enable continue (ignore errors) mode.
Multiple occorrences of
.B \-c
make
.BR slapcat (8)
try harder.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
Enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
Specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the
default config directory will be made before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored.
.TP
.B \-g
disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).
.TP
.B \-H \ URI
use dn, scope and filter from URI to only handle matching entries.
.TP
.BI \-l \ ldif-file
Write LDIF to specified file instead of standard output.
.TP
.BI \-n \ dbnum
Generate output for the \fIdbnum\fR-th database listed in the
configuration file. The config database
.BR slapd\-config (5),
is always the first database, so use
.B \-n 0
to select it.

The
.B \-n
cannot be used in conjunction with the
.B \-b
option.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))

\fIn\fP is the number of columns allowed for the LDIF output
(\fIn\fP equal to \fI0\fP uses the default, corresponding to 76).
Use \fIno\fP for no wrap.
.TP
.BI \-s \ subtree-dn
Only dump entries in the subtree specified by this DN.
Implies \fB\-b\fP \fIsubtree-dn\fP if no
.B \-b
or
.B \-n
option is given.
Deprecated; use \fB-H\fP \fIldap:///subtree-dn\fP instead.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.
.SH LIMITATIONS
For some backend types, your
.BR slapd (8)
should not be running (at least, not in read-write
mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the database. It is
always safe to run 
.B slapcat
with the
.BR slapd\-bdb (5),
.BR slapd\-hdb (5),
and
.BR slapd\-null (5)
backends.
.SH EXAMPLES
To make a text backup of your SLAPD database and put it in a file called
.BR ldif ,
give the command:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	/usr/sbin/slapcat \-l ldif
.ft

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapd
is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP connections on
any number of ports (default \fB389\fP), responding
to the LDAP operations it receives over these connections.
.B slapd
is typically invoked at boot time, usually out of
.BR  /etc/rc.local .
Upon startup,
.B slapd
normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
If configured in the config file (or config directory),
the
.B slapd
process will print its process ID (see
.BR getpid (2))
to a 
.B .pid
file, as well as the command line options during invocation to an
.B .args
file (see 
.BR slapd.conf (5)).
If the
.B \-d
flag is given, even with a zero argument,
.B slapd
will not fork and disassociate from the invoking tty.
.LP
See the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
.BR slapd .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-4
Listen on IPv4 addresses only.
.TP
.B \-6
Listen on IPv6 addresses only.
.TP
.BI \-T \ tool
Run in Tool mode. The \fItool\fP argument selects whether to run as
.IR slapadd ,
.IR slapcat ,
.IR slapdn ,
.IR slapindex ,
.IR slappasswd ,
.IR slapschema ,
or
.I slaptest
(\fIslapacl\fP and \fIslapauth\fP need the entire \fBacl\fP and \fBauth\fP
option value to be spelled out, as \fBa\fP is reserved to
.IR slapadd ).
This option should be the first option specified when it is used;
any remaining options will be interpreted by the corresponding 
slap tool program, according to the respective man pages.
Note that these tool programs will usually be symbolic links to
.BR slapd .
This option is provided for situations where symbolic links 
are not provided or not usable.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
Turn on debugging as defined by
.IR debug-level .
If this option is specified, even with a zero argument,
.B slapd
will not fork or disassociate from the invoking terminal.  Some general
operation and status messages are printed for any value of \fIdebug-level\fP.
\fIdebug-level\fP is taken as a bit string, with each bit corresponding to a
different kind of debugging information.  See <ldap_log.h> for details.
Comma-separated arrays of friendly names can be specified to select
debugging output of the corresponding debugging information.
All the names recognized by the \fIloglevel\fP directive 
described in \fBslapd.conf\fP(5) are supported.
If \fIdebug-level\fP is \fB?\fP, a list of installed debug-levels is printed,
and slapd exits.

Remember that if you turn on packet logging, packets containing bind passwords
will be output, so if you redirect the log to a logfile, that file should
be read-protected.
.TP
.BI \-s \ syslog-level
This option tells
.B slapd
at what debug-level debugging statements should be logged to the
.BR syslog (8)
facility.
The value \fIsyslog-level\fP can be set to any value or combination
allowed by the \fB\-d\fP switch.
Slapd logs all messages selected by \fIsyslog-leveli\fP 
at the
.BR syslog (3)
severity debug-level \fBDEBUG\fP,
on the unit specified with \fB\-l\fP.
.TP
.BI \-n \ service-name
Specifies the service name for logging and other purposes.  Defaults
to basename of argv[0], i.e.: "slapd".
.TP
.BI \-l \ syslog-local-user
Selects the local user of the
.BR syslog (8)
facility. Value can be 
.BR LOCAL0 , 
through
.BR LOCAL7 ,
as well as
.B USER
and
.BR DAEMON .
The default is
.BR LOCAL4 .
However, this option is only permitted on systems that support
local users with the 
.BR syslog (8)
facility.
Logging to syslog(8) occurs at the "DEBUG" severity debug-level.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd-config-file
Specifies the slapd configuration file. The default is
.BR /etc/openldap/slapd.conf .
.TP
.BI \-F \ slapd-config-directory
Specifies the slapd configuration directory. The default is
.BR /etc/openldap/slapd.d .
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, slapd will attempt to read the
default config directory before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored. All of the slap tools that
use the config options observe this same behavior.
.TP
.BI \-h \ URLlist
.B slapd
will by default serve
.B ldap:///
(LDAP over TCP on all interfaces on default LDAP port).  That is, 
it will bind using INADDR_ANY and port \fB389\fP.
The
.B \-h
option may be used to specify LDAP (and other scheme) URLs to serve.
For example, if slapd is given
.BR "\-h \(dqldap://127.0.0.1:9009/ ldaps:/// ldapi:///\(dq" , 
it will listen on 127.0.0.1:9009 for LDAP, 0.0.0.0:636 for LDAP over TLS,
and LDAP over IPC (Unix domain sockets).  Host 0.0.0.0 represents
INADDR_ANY (any interface).
A space separated list of URLs is expected.  The URLs should be of
the LDAP, LDAPS, or LDAPI schemes, and generally
without a DN or other optional parameters (excepting as discussed below).
Support for the latter two schemes depends on selected configuration 
options.  Hosts may be specified by name or IPv4 and IPv6 address formats.
Ports, if specified, must be numeric.  The default ldap:// port is \fB389\fP
and the default ldaps:// port is \fB636\fP.

For LDAP over IPC,
.B name 
is the name of the socket, and no
.B port
is required, nor allowed; note that directory separators must be 
URL-encoded, like any other characters that are special to URLs; 
so the socket

        /usr/local/var/ldapi

must be specified as

        ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi

The default location for the IPC socket is /var/db/openldap/run/ldapi

The listener permissions are indicated by
"x\-mod=\-rwxrwxrwx", "x\-mod=0777" or "x\-mod=777", where any 
of the "rwx" can be "\-" to suppress the related permission, while any 
of the "7" can be any legal octal digit, according to chmod(1).
The listeners can take advantage of the "x\-mod"
extension to apply rough limitations to operations, e.g. allow read operations
("r", which applies to search and compare), write operations ("w", 
which applies to add, delete, modify and modrdn), and execute operations
("x", which means bind is required).
"User" permissions apply to authenticated users, while "other" apply
to anonymous users; "group" permissions are ignored.
For example, "ldap:///????x\-mod=\-rw\-\-\-\-\-\-\-" means that read and write is only allowed
for authenticated connections, and bind is required for all operations.
This feature is experimental, and requires to be manually enabled
at configure time.
.TP
.BI \-r \ directory
Specifies a directory to become the root directory.  slapd will
change the current working directory to this directory and
then
.BR chroot (2)
to this directory.  This is done after opening listeners but before
reading any configuration file or initializing any backend.  When
used as a security mechanism, it should be used in conjunction with
.B \-u
and
.B \-g
options.
.TP
.BI \-u \ user
.B slapd
will run slapd with the specified user name or id, and that user's
supplementary group access list as set with initgroups(3).  The group ID
is also changed to this user's gid, unless the \fB\-g\fP option is used to
override.  Note when used with
.BR \-r ,
slapd will use the user database in the change root environment.

Note that on some systems, running as a non-privileged user will prevent
passwd back-ends from accessing the encrypted passwords.  Note also that
any shell back-ends will run as the specified non-privileged user.
.TP
.BI \-g \ group
.B slapd
will run with the specified group name or id.  Note when used with
.BR \-r ,
slapd will use the group database in the change root environment.
.TP
.BI \-c \ cookie
This option provides a cookie for the syncrepl replication consumer.
The cookie is a comma separated list of \fIname=value\fP pairs.
Currently supported syncrepl cookie fields are
.BR rid ,
.BR sid ,
and
.BR csn .
.B rid
identifies a replication thread within the consumer server
and is used to find the syncrepl specification in 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
or
.BR slapd\-config (5)
having the matching replication identifier in its definition. The
.B rid
must be provided in order for any other specified values to be used.
.B sid
is the server id in a multi-master/mirror-mode configuration.
.B csn
is the commit sequence number received by a previous synchronization
and represents the state of the consumer replica content which the
syncrepl engine will synchronize to the current provider content.
In case of \fImirror-mode\fP or \fImulti-master\fP replication agreement,
multiple
.B csn
values, semicolon separated, can appear.
Use only the 
.B rid
part to force a full reload.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
This option provides a generic means to specify options without the need to reserve
a separate letter for them.

It supports the following options:
.RS
.TP
.BR slp= { on \||\| off \||\| \fIslp-attrs\fP }
When SLP support is compiled into slapd, disable it (\fBoff\fP),
 enable it by registering at SLP DAs without specific SLP attributes (\fBon\fP),
or with specific SLP attributes
.I slp-attrs
that must be an SLP attribute list definition according to the SLP standard.

For example, \fB"slp=(tree=production),(server-type=OpenLDAP),(server\-version=2.4.15)"\fP
registers at SLP DAs with the three SLP attributes tree, server-type and server-version
that have the values given above.
This allows to specifically query the SLP DAs for LDAP servers holding the
.I production
tree in case multiple trees are available.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapdn
is used to check the conformance of a DN based on the schema
defined in
.BR slapd (8)
and that loaded via 
.BR slapd.conf (5).
It opens the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
configuration file or the slapd\-config (5) backend, reads in the schema definitions, and then
parses the 
.I DN
list given on the command-line.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the
default config directory will be made before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored.
.TP
.BI \-N
only output a normalized form of the \fIDN\fP, suitable to be used
in a normalization tool; incompatible with
.BR \-P .
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-user=<user>   (see `\-l' in slapd(8))

.fi
.TP
.BI \-P
only output a prettified form of the \fIDN\fP, suitable to be used
in a check and beautification tool; incompatible with
.BR \-N .
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.SH EXAMPLES
To check a

.B 
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapindex
is used to regenerate
.BR slapd (8)
indices based upon the current contents of a database.
It opens the given database determined by the database number or
suffix and updates the indices for all values of all attributes
of all entries. If a list of specific attributes is provided
on the command line, only the indices for those attributes will
be regenerated.
Databases configured as
.B subordinate
of this one are also re-indexed, unless \fB\-g\fP is specified.

All files eventually created by
.BR slapindex
will belong to the identity
.BR slapindex
is run as, so make sure you either run
.BR slapindex
with the same identity
.BR slapd (8)
will be run as (see option
.B \-u
in
.BR slapd (8)),
or change file ownership before running
.BR slapd (8).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-b \ suffix
Use the specified \fIsuffix\fR to determine which database to
generate output for.  The \fB\-b\fP cannot be used in conjunction
with the
.B \-n
option.
.TP
.B \-c
enable continue (ignore errors) mode.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the
default config directory will be made before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored.
.TP
.B \-g
disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).
.TP
.BI \-n \ dbnum
Generate output for the \fIdbnum\fR-th database listed in the
configuration file. The config database
.BR slapd\-config (5),
is always the first database, so use
.B \-n 0

The
.B \-n
cannot be used in conjunction with the
.B \-b
option.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-user=<user>   (see `\-l' in slapd(8))

.fi
.TP
.B \-q
enable quick (fewer integrity checks) mode. Performs no consistency checks
when writing the database. Improves indexing time,
.B however
the database will most likely be unusable if any errors or
interruptions occur.
.TP
.B \-t
enable truncate mode. Truncates (empties) an index database before indexing
any entries. May only be used with Quick mode.
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Your
.BR slapd (8)
should not be running (at least, not in read-write
mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the database.
.LP
This command provides ample opportunity for the user to obtain
and drink their favorite beverage.
.SH EXAMPLES
To reindex your SLAPD database, give the command:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	/usr/sbin/slapindex
.ft
.fi
To regenerate the index for only a specific attribute, e.g. "uid",
give the command:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	/usr/sbin/slapindex uid
.ft

.B 
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slappasswd
is used to generate an userPassword value
suitable for use with
.BR ldapmodify (1),
.BR slapd.conf (5)
.I rootpw
configuration directive or the 
.BR slapd\-config (5) 
.I olcRootPW
configuration directive.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-u
Generate RFC 2307 userPassword values (the default).  Future
versions of this program may generate alternative syntaxes
by default.  This option is provided for forward compatibility.
.TP
.BI \-s \ secret
The secret to hash.
If this,
.B \-g
and
.B \-T
are absent, the user will be prompted for the secret to hash.
.BR \-s ,
.B \-g
and
.B \-T
are mutually exclusive flags.
.TP
.BI \-g
Generate the secret.
If this,
.B \-s
and
.B \-T
are absent, the user will be prompted for the secret to hash.
.BR \-s ,
.B \-g
and
.B \-T
are mutually exclusive flags.
If this is present,
.I {CLEARTEXT}
is used as scheme.
.B \-g
and
.B \-h
are mutually exclusive flags.
.TP
.BI \-T \ "file"
Hash the contents of the file.
If this,
.B \-g
and
.B \-s
are absent, the user will be prompted for the secret to hash.
.BR \-s ,
.B \-g
and
.B \-T
and mutually exclusive flags.
.TP
.BI \-h \ "scheme"
If \fB\-h\fP is specified, one of the following RFC 2307 schemes may
be specified:
.BR {CRYPT} ,
.BR {MD5} ,
.BR {SMD5} ,
.BR {SSHA} ", and"
.BR {SHA} .
The default is 
.BR {SSHA} .

Note that scheme names may need to be protected, due to
.B {
and
.BR } ,
from expansion by the user's command interpreter.

.B {SHA}
and
.B {SSHA}
use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the latter with a seed.

.B {MD5}
and
.B {SMD5}
use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter with a seed.

.B {CRYPT}
uses the
.BR crypt (3).

.B {CLEARTEXT}
indicates that the new password should be added to userPassword as
clear text.
Unless
.I {CLEARTEXT}
is used, this flag is incompatible with option
.BR \-g .
.TP
.BI \-c \ crypt-salt-format
Specify the format of the salt passed to
.BR crypt (3)
when generating {CRYPT} passwords.  
This string needs to be in
.BR sprintf (3)
format and may include one (and only one)
.B %s
conversion.
This conversion will be substituted with a string of random
characters from [A\-Za\-z0\-9./].  For example,
.RB ' %.2s '
provides a two character salt and
.RB ' $1$%.8s '
tells some
versions of
.BR crypt (3)
to use an MD5 algorithm and provides
8 random characters of salt.
The default is
.RB ' %s ' ,
which provides 31 characters of salt.
.TP
.BI \-n
Omit the trailing newline; useful to pipe the credentials
into a command.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The practice of storing hashed passwords in userPassword violates
Standard Track (RFC 4519) schema specifications and may hinder
interoperability.  A new attribute type, authPassword, to hold
hashed passwords has been defined (RFC 3112), but is not yet
implemented in
.BR slapd (8).
.LP
It should also be noted that the behavior of
.BR crypt (3)
is platform specific.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during
protocol transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections
should be in-place before using LDAP simple bind.
.LP
The hashed password values should be protected as if they
were clear text passwords.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapschema
is used to check schema compliance of the contents of a
.BR slapd (8)
database.
It opens the given database determined by the database number or
suffix and checks the compliance of its contents with the corresponding
schema. Errors are written to standard output or the specified file.
Databases configured as
.B subordinate
of this one are also output, unless \fB\-g\fP is specified.
.LP
Administrators may need to modify existing schema items, including
adding new required attributes to objectClasses,
removing existing required or allowed attributes from objectClasses,
entirely removing objectClasses,
or any other change that may result in making perfectly valid entries
no longer compliant with the modified schema.
The execution of the
.B slapschema tool after modifying the schema can point out
inconsistencies that would otherwise surface only when
inconsistent entries need to be modified.

.LP
The entry records are checked in database order, not superior first
order.  The entry records will be checked considering all
(user and operational) attributes stored in the database.
Dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry)
will not be considered.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a \ filter
Only check entries matching the asserted filter.
For example

slapschema \-a \\
    "(!(entryDN:dnSubtreeMatch:=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com))"

will check all but the "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" subtree
of the "dc=example,dc=com" database.
Deprecated; use \fB-H\fP \fIldap:///???(filter)\fP instead.
.TP
.BI \-b \ suffix 
Use the specified \fIsuffix\fR to determine which database to
check.  The \fB\-b\fP cannot be used in conjunction
with the
.B \-n
option.
.TP
.B \-c
Enable continue (ignore errors) mode.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
Enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
Specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the
default config directory will be made before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored.
.TP
.B \-g
disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).
.TP
.B \-H \ URI
use dn, scope and filter from URI to only handle matching entries.
.TP
.BI \-l \ error-file
Write errors to specified file instead of standard output.
.TP
.BI \-n \ dbnum
Check the \fIdbnum\fR\-th database listed in the
configuration file. The config database
.BR slapd\-config (5),
is always the first database, so use
.B \-n 0

The
.B \-n
cannot be used in conjunction with the
.B \-b
option.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-user=<user>   (see `\-l' in slapd(8))

.fi
.TP
.BI \-s \ subtree-dn
Only check entries in the subtree specified by this DN.
Implies \fB\-b\fP \fIsubtree-dn\fP if no
.B \-b
nor
.B \-n
option is given.
Deprecated; use \fB-H\fP \fIldap:///subtree-dn\fP instead.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.
.SH LIMITATIONS
For some backend types, your
.BR slapd (8)
should not be running (at least, not in read-write
mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the database. It is
always safe to run 
.B slapschema
with the
.BR slapd\-bdb (5),
.BR slapd\-hdb (5),
and
.BR slapd\-null (5)
backends.
.SH EXAMPLES
To check the schema compliance of your SLAPD database after modifications
to the schema, and put any error in a file called
.BR errors.ldif ,
give the command:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	/usr/sbin/slapcat \-l errors.ldif
.ft

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slaptest
is used to check the conformance of the
.BR slapd (8)
configuration.
It opens the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
configuration file or the 
.BR slapd\-config (5) 
backend, and parses it according to the general and the backend-specific 
rules, checking its sanity.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug-level
enable debugging messages as defined by the specified
.IR debug-level ;
see
.BR slapd (8)
for details.
.TP
.BI \-f \ slapd.conf
specify an alternative
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
.TP
.BI \-F \ confdir
specify a config directory.
If both
.B \-f
and
.B \-F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified directory.
If neither option is specified, slaptest will attempt to read the
default config directory before trying to use the default
config file. If a valid config directory exists then the
default config file is ignored. If dry-run mode is also specified,
no conversion will occur.
.TP
.BI \-n \ dbnum
Just open and test the \fIdbnum\fR-th database listed in the
configuration file. 
To only test the config database
.BR slapd\-config (5),
use 
.B \-n 0
as it is always the first database.
.TP
.BI \-o \ option\fR[ = value\fR]
Specify an
.I option
with a(n optional)
.IR value .
Possible generic options/values are:
.LP
.nf
              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `\-s' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-level=<level> (see `\-S' in slapd(8))
              syslog\-user=<user>   (see `\-l' in slapd(8))

.fi
.TP
.BI \-Q
Be extremely quiet: only the exit code indicates success (0) or not 
(any other value).
.TP
.B \-u
enable dry-run mode (i.e. don't fail if databases cannot be opened,
but config is fine).
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.SH EXAMPLES
To check a 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
give the command:

Postfix SMTP+LMTP client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBsmtp\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix SMTP+LMTP client implements the SMTP and LMTP mail
delivery protocols. It processes message delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The SMTP+LMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
appropriate.

The SMTP+LMTP client looks up a list of mail exchanger addresses for
the destination host, sorts the list by preference, and connects
to each listed address until it finds a server that responds.

When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails due
to a recoverable error condition, the SMTP+LMTP client will try to
deliver the mail to an alternate host.

After a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved
to the \fBscache\fR(8) connection cache server, so that it
may be used by any SMTP+LMTP client for a subsequent transaction.

By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for
destinations that have a high volume of mail in the active
queue. Connection caching can be enabled permanently for
specific destinations.
.SH "SMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
SMTP destinations have the following form:
.IP \fIdomainname\fR
.IP \fIdomainname\fR:\fIport\fR
Look up the mail exchangers for the specified domain, and
connect to the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR).
.IP [\fIhostname\fR]
.IP [\fIhostname\fR]:\fIport\fR
Look up the address(es) of the specified host, and connect to
the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR).
.IP [\fIaddress\fR]
.IP [\fIaddress\fR]:\fIport\fR
Connect to the host at the specified address, and connect
to the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR). An IPv6 address
must be formatted as [\fBipv6\fR:\fIaddress\fR].
.SH "LMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
LMTP destinations have the following form:
.IP \fBunix\fR:\fIpathname\fR
Connect to the local UNIX-domain server that is bound to the specified
\fIpathname\fR. If the process runs chrooted, an absolute pathname
is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.
.IP \fBinet\fR:\fIhostname\fR

.SH BUGS

SMTP and LMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
support for TLS object passivation and re-activation does not
exist without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

SMTP and LMTP connection caching assumes that SASL credentials
are valid for all destinations that map onto the same IP
address and TCP port.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Before Postfix version 2.3, the LMTP client is a separate
program that implements only a subset of the functionality
available with SMTP: there is no support for TLS, and
connections are cached in-process, making it ineffective
when the client is used for multiple domains.

Most smtp_\fIxxx\fR configuration parameters have an
lmtp_\fIxxx\fR "mirror" parameter for the equivalent LMTP
feature. This document describes only those LMTP-related
parameters that aren't simply "mirror" parameters.

Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as \fBsmtp\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See

Postfix SMTP server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBsmtpd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]

\fBsendmail -bs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server accepts network connection requests
and performs zero or more SMTP transactions per connection.
Each received message is piped through the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon, and is placed into the \fBincoming\fR queue as one
single queue file.  For this mode of operation, the program
expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process manager.

Alternatively, the SMTP server be can run in stand-alone
mode; this is traditionally obtained with "\fBsendmail
-bs\fR".  When the SMTP server runs stand-alone with non
$\fBmail_owner\fR privileges, it receives mail even while
the mail system is not running, deposits messages directly
into the \fBmaildrop\fR queue, and disables the SMTP server's
access policies. As of Postfix version 2.3, the SMTP server
refuses to receive mail from the network when it runs with
non $\fBmail_owner\fR privileges.

The SMTP server implements a variety of policies for connection
requests, and for parameters given to \fBHELO, ETRN, MAIL FROM, VRFY\fR
and \fBRCPT TO\fR commands. They are detailed below and in the
\fBmain.cf\fR configuration file.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
clients and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP server can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH "STANDARDS"

.SH NAME
snmpd - daemon to respond to SNMP request packets.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpd
[OPTIONS] [LISTENING ADDRESSES]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpd
is an SNMP agent which binds to a port and awaits requests from
SNMP management software.  Upon receiving a request, it processes the
request(s), collects the requested information and/or performs the
requested operation(s) and returns the information to the sender.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -a
Log the source addresses of incoming requests.
.TP
.B -A
Append to the log file rather than truncating it.
.TP
.B "-c" \fIFILE
Read 
.I FILE
as a configuration file
(or a comma-separated list of configuration files).  Note that the loaded
file will only understand snmpd.conf tokens, unless the configuration type
is specified in the file as described in the snmp_config man page under
SWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE.
.TP
.B -C
Do not read any configuration files except the ones optionally specified by the 
.B -c 
option.
Note that this behaviour also covers the persistent configuration files.
This may result in dynamically-assigned values being reset following an
agent restart, unless the relevant persistent config files are
explicitly loaded using the
.B -c 
option.
.TP
.B -d
Dump (in hexadecimal) the sent and received SNMP packets.
.TP
.B -D\fI[TOKEN[,...]]
Turn on debugging output for the given
.IR "TOKEN" "(s)."
Without any tokens specified, it defaults to printing all the tokens
(which is equivalent to the keyword "ALL").
You might want to try
.IR ALL
for extremely verbose output.  Note: You can not put a space between
the -D flag and the listed TOKENs.
.TP
.B -f
Do not fork() from the calling shell.
.TP
.B -g \fIGID
Change to the numerical group ID
.I GID
after opening listening sockets.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display a brief usage message and then exit.
.TP
.B -H
Display a list of configuration file directives understood by the
agent and then exit.
.TP
.B -I \fI[-]INITLIST
Specifies which modules should (or should not) be initialized
when the agent starts up.  If the comma-separated
.I INITLIST
is preceded
with a '-', it is the list of modules that should \fInot\fR be started.
Otherwise this is the list of the \fIonly\fR modules that should be started.

To get a list of compiled modules, run the agent with the arguments
.I "-Dmib_init -H"
(assuming debugging support has been compiled in).
.TP
.B -L[efos]
Specify where logging output should be directed (standard error or output,
to a file or via syslog).  See LOGGING OPTIONS in snmpcmd(5) for details.
.TP
.BR -m " \fIMIBLIST"
Specifies a colon separated list of MIB modules to load for this
application.  This overrides the environment variable MIBS.
See \fIsnmpcmd(1)\fR for details.
.TP
.BR -M " \fIDIRLIST"
Specifies a colon separated list of directories to search for MIBs.
This overrides the environment variable MIBDIRS.
See \fIsnmpcmd(1)\fR for details.
.TP
.B -n \fINAME
Set an alternative application name (which will affect the
configuration files loaded).
By default this will be \fIsnmpd\fR, regardless of the name
of the actual binary.
.TP
.B -p \fIFILE
Save the process ID of the daemon in
.IR FILE "."
.TP 
.B -q
Print simpler output for easier automated parsing.
.TP
.B -r
Do not require root access to run the daemon.  Specifically, do not exit
if files only accessible to root (such as /dev/kmem etc.) cannot be
opened.
.TP
.B -u \fIUID
Change to the user ID
.I UID
(which can be given in numerical or textual form) after opening
listening sockets.
.TP
.B -U
Instructs the agent to not remove its pid file (see the
.B -p
option) on shutdown. Overrides the leave_pidfile token in the
.I snmpd.conf
file, see
.I snmpd.conf(5).
.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version information for the agent and then exit.
.TP
.B -V
Symbolically dump SNMP transactions.
.TP
.B -x \fIADDRESS
Listens for AgentX connections on the specified address
rather than the default AGENTX_SOCKET.
The address can either be a Unix domain socket path,
or the address of a network interface.  The format is the same as the
format of listening addresses described below.
.TP
.B -X
Run as an AgentX subagent rather than as an SNMP master agent.
.TP
.BI -- "name"="value"
Allows to specify any token ("name") supported in the
.I snmpd.conf
file and sets its value to "value". Overrides the corresponding token in the
.I snmpd.conf
file. See
.I snmpd.conf(5)
for the full list of tokens.
.SH LISTENING ADDRESSES
By default,
.B snmpd
listens for incoming SNMP requests on UDP port 161 on all IPv4 interfaces.
However, it is possible to modify this behaviour by specifying one or more
listening addresses as arguments to \fBsnmpd\fR.
A listening address takes the form:
.IP
[<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>
.PP
At its simplest, a listening address may consist only of a port
number, in which case
.B snmpd
listens on that UDP port on all IPv4 interfaces.  Otherwise, the
<transport-address> part of the specification is parsed according to
the following table:
.RS 4
.TP 28
.BR "<transport-specifier>"
.BR "<transport-address> format"
.IP "udp \fI(default)\fR" 28
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv4-address[:port]
.IP "tcp" 28
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv4-address[:port]
.IP "unix" 28
pathname
.IP "ipx" 28
[network]:node[/port]
.TP 28 
.IR "" "aal5pvc " or " pvc"
[interface.][VPI.]VCI
.TP 28
.IR "" "udp6 " or " udpv6 " or " udpipv6"
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv6-address[:port]
.TP 28
.IR "" "tcp6 " or " tcpv6 " or " tcpipv6"
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv6-address[:port]
.TP 28
.IR "" "ssh"
hostname:port
.TP 28
.IR "" "dtlsudp"
hostname:port
.RE
.PP
Note that <transport-specifier> strings are case-insensitive so that,
for example, "tcp" and "TCP" are equivalent.  Here are some examples,
along with their interpretation:
.TP 24
.IR "127.0.0.1:161"
listen on UDP port 161, but only on the loopback interface.  This
prevents
.B snmpd
being queried remotely.  The  port specification ":161" is
not strictly necessary since that is the default SNMP port.
.TP 24
.IR "TCP:1161"
listen on TCP port 1161 on all IPv4 interfaces.
.TP 24
.IR "ipx:/40000"
listen on IPX port 40000 on all IPX interfaces.
.TP 24
.IR "unix:/tmp/local-agent"
listen on the Unix domain socket \fI/tmp/local-agent\fR.
.TP 24
.IR "/tmp/local-agent"
is identical to the previous specification, since the Unix domain is
assumed if the first character of the <transport-address> is '/'.
.TP 24
.IR "PVC:161"
listen on the AAL5 permanent virtual circuit with VPI=0 and VCI=161
(decimal) on the first ATM adapter in the machine.
.TP 24
.IR "udp6:10161"
listen on port 10161 on all IPv6 interfaces.
.TP 24
.IR "ssh:127.0.0.1:22"
Allows connections from the snmp subsystem on the ssh server on port
22.  The details of using SNMP over SSH are defined below.
.TP 24
.IR "dtlsudp:127.0.0.1:9161"
Listen for connections over DTLS on UDP port 9161.  The snmp.conf file
must have the
.IR serverCert,
configuration tokens defined.
.PP
Note that not all the transport domains listed above will always be
available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6 support will not be able
to use udp6 transport addresses, and attempts to do so will result in
the error "Error opening specified endpoint".  Likewise, since AAL5
PVC support is only currently available on Linux, it will fail with
the same error on other platforms.
.SH Transport Specific Notes
.RS 0
.TP 8
ssh
The SSH transport, on the server side, is actually just a unix
named pipe that can be connected to via a ssh subsystem configured in
the main ssh server.  The pipe location (configurable with the
sshtosnmpsocket token in snmp.conf) is
.I /var/net-snmp/sshtosnmp.
Packets should be submitted to it via the sshtosnmp application, which
also sends the user ID as well when starting the connection.  The TSM
security model should be used when packets should process it.
.IP
The
.I sshtosnmp
command knows how to connect to this pipe and talk to
it.  It should be configured in the
.IR "OpenSSH sshd"
configuration file (which is normally
.IR "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
using the following configuration line:
.TP 8
.IP
Subsystem snmp /usr/local/bin/sshtosnmp
.IP
The
.I sshtosnmp
command will need read/write access to the 
.I /var/net-snmp/sshtosnmp
pipe.  Although it should be fairly safe to grant access to the
average user since it still requires modifications to the ACM settings
before the user can perform operations, paranoid administrators may
want to make the /var/net-snmp directory accessible only by users in a
particular group.  Use the
.I sshtosnmpsocketperms
snmp.conf configure option to set the permissions, owner and group of
the created socket.
.IP
Access control can be granted to the user "foo" using the following
style of simple snmpd.conf settings:
.TP 8
.IP
rouser -s tsm foo authpriv
.IP
Note that "authpriv" is acceptable assuming as SSH protects everything
that way (assuming you have a non-insane setup).
snmpd has no notion of how SSH has actually protected a packet and
thus the snmp agent assumes all packets passed through the SSH
transport have been protected at the authpriv level.
.TP 8
dtlsudp
The DTLS protocol, which is based off of TLS, requires both client and
server certificates to establish the connection and authenticate both
sides.  In order to do this, the client will need to configure the
snmp.conf file
with the
.IR clientCert
configuration tokens.  The server will need to configure the snmp.conf
file with the
.IR serverCert
configuration tokens defined.
.IP
Access control setup is similar to the ssh transport as the TSM
security model should be used to protect the packet.
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.PP
.B snmpd
checks for the existence of and parses the following files:
.TP 6
.B /etc/snmp/snmp.conf
Common configuration for the agent and applications. See
.I snmp.conf(5)
for details.
.TP
.B /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
.TP
.B /etc/snmp/snmpd.local.conf
Agent-specific configuration.  See
.I snmpd.conf(5)
for details.  These files are optional and may be used to configure
access control, trap generation, subagent protocols and much else
besides.
.IP
In addition to these two configuration files in /etc/snmp, the
agent will read any files with the names
.I snmpd.conf
and
.I snmpd.local.conf
in a colon separated path specified in the
SNMPCONFPATH environment variable.
.TP
.B /usr/share/snmp/mibs/
The agent will also load all files in this directory as MIBs.  It will
not, however, load any file that begins with a '.' or descend into
subdirectories.

.B -I \fI[-]INITLIST
Specifies which modules should (or should not) be initialized
when snmptrapd starts up.  If the comma-separated
.I INITLIST
is preceded
with a '-', it is the list of modules that should \fInot\fR be started.
Otherwise this is the list of the \fIonly\fR modules that should be started.

To get a list of compiled modules, run snmptrapd with the arguments
.I "-Dmib_init -H"
(assuming debugging support has been compiled in).
.TP
.B -L[efos]

The "use alternate form" flag changes the behavior of various format
string sequences:
.IP
Time information will be displayed based on GMT (rather than the local timezone)
.IP
The variable-bindings will be a comma-separated list (rather than a tab-separated one)
.IP
The system uptime will be broken down into a human-meaningful format (rather than being a simple integer)
.SS Examples:
.PP
To get a message like "14:03 TRAP3.1 from humpty.ucd.edu" you 
could use something like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
snmptrapd -P -F "%02.2h:%02.2j TRAP%w.%q from %A\en"
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you want the same thing but in GMT rather than local time, use
.PP
.RS
.nf
snmptrapd -P -F "%#02.2h:%#02.2j TRAP%w.%q from %A\en"
.fi
.RE
.SH LISTENING ADDRESSES
By default,
.B snmptrapd
listens for incoming SNMP TRAP and INFORM packets on UDP port 162 on
all IPv4 interfaces.  However, it is possible to modify this behaviour
by specifying one or more listening addresses as arguments to
.BR snmptrapd .
See the
.I snmpd(8)
manual page for more information about the format of listening
addresses.
.SH NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB SUPPORT
As of net-snmp 5.0, the snmptrapd application supports the
NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB.  It does this by opening an AgentX subagent
connection to the master snmpd agent and registering the notification
log tables.  As long as the snmpd application is started first, it
will attach itself to it and thus you should be able to view the last
recorded notifications via the nlmLogTable and nlmLogVariableTable.
See the snmptrapd.conf file and the "dontRetainLogs" token for turning
off this support.  See the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB for more details about
the MIB itself.
.SH EXTENSIBILITY AND CONFIGURATION

.I snmptrapd.conf(5)
manual page.

.Nm
as root and avoid all further authentication prompts.
.Pp
The following
.Ar commands
are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl l | -list
List all available updates.
.It Fl i | -install
Each update specified by
.Ar args
is downloaded and installed.
.Ar args
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar -r | --recommended
All updates that are recommended for your system. These are prefixed with a
.Em *
character in the
.Cm --list
output.
.It Ar -a | --all
All updates that are applicable to your system, including those non-recommended ones,
which are prefixed with a 
.Em -
character in the
.Cm --list
output. (Non-recommended updates are uncommon in any case.)
.It Ar item ...
One or more specified updates. The 
.Cm --list
output shows the item names you can specify here, prefixed by the
.Em *
or
.Em -
characters. See
.Sx EXAMPLES .

.SH NAME
spawn
\-
Postfix external command spawner
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBspawn\fR [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBspawn\fR(8) daemon provides the Postfix equivalent
of \fBinetd\fR.
It listens on a port as specified in the Postfix \fBmaster.cf\fR file
and spawns an external command whenever a connection is established.
The connection can be made over local IPC (such as UNIX-domain
sockets) or over non-local IPC (such as TCP sockets).
The command\'s standard input, output and error streams are connected
directly to the communication endpoint.

This daemon expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.
.SH "COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The external command attributes are given in the \fBmaster.cf\fR
file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:
.IP "\fBuser\fR=\fIusername\fR (required)"
.IP "\fBuser\fR=\fIusername\fR:\fIgroupname\fR"
The external command is executed with the rights of the
specified \fIusername\fR.  The software refuses to execute
commands with root privileges, or with the privileges of the
mail system owner. If \fIgroupname\fR is specified, the
corresponding group ID is used instead of the group ID
of \fIusername\fR.
.IP "\fBargv\fR=\fIcommand\fR... (required)"
The command to be executed. This must be specified as the
last command attribute.
The command is executed directly, i.e. without interpretation of
shell meta characters by a shell command interpreter.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
In order to enforce standard Postfix process resource controls,
the \fBspawn\fR(8) daemon runs only one external command at a time.
As such, it presents a noticeable overhead by wasting precious
process resources. The \fBspawn\fR(8) daemon is expected to be
replaced by a more structural solution.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
The \fBspawn\fR(8) daemon reports abnormal child exits.
Problems are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
This program needs root privilege in order to execute external
commands as the specified user. It is therefore security sensitive.
However the \fBspawn\fR(8) daemon does not talk to the external command
and thus is not vulnerable to data-driven attacks.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically as \fBspawn\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

In the text below, \fItransport\fR is the first field of the entry
in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file.
.SH "RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROL"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fItransport\fB_time_limit ($command_time_limit)\fR"
The amount of time the command is allowed to run before it is
terminated.

Postfix 2.4 and later support a suffix that specifies the
time unit: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days),
w (weeks). The default time unit is seconds.
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBexport_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The list of environment variables that a Postfix process will export
to non-Postfix processes.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmail_owner (postfix)\fR"
The UNIX system account that owns the Postfix queue and most Postfix
daemon processes.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBqueue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.
.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that "smtpd" becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages the security assessment policy subsystem.
.Pp
This subsystem maintains and evaluates rules that determine whether
the system allows the installation, execution, and other operations on
files on the system.
.Pp
.Nm
requires one command option that determines its principal operation:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl -add
Add rule(s) to the system-wide assessment rule database.
.It Fl a, -assess
Requests that
.Nm
perform an assessment on the
.Ar files
given.
.It Fl -disable
Disable one or more rules in the assessment rule database.
Disabled rules are not considered when performing assessment, but
remain in the database and can be re-enabled later.
.It Fl -enable
Enable rule(s) in the assessment rule database, counteracting earlier disabling.
.It Fl -disable
.It Fl -master-disable
Disable the assessment subsystem altogether.
Operations that would be denied by system policy will be allowed to
proceed; assessment APIs always report success.
Requires root access.
.It Fl -master-enable
Enable the assessment subsystem.
Operations that are denied by system policy will fail;
assessment APIs report the truth.
Requires root access.
.It Fl -remove
Remove rule(s) from the assessment rule database.
.It Fl -status
Query whether the assessment subsystem is enabled or disabled.
.El
.Pp
In addition, the following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl -anchor
In rule update operations, indicates that the arguments are hashes of anchor certificates.
.It Fl -continue
If the assessment of a file fails, continue assessing additional file arguments.
Without this option, the first failed assessment terminates operation.
.It Fl -hash
In rule update operations, indicates that the arguments are code directory hashes.
.It Fl -ignore-cache
Do not query or use the assessment object cache.
This may significantly slow down operation.
Newly generated assessments may still be stored in the cache.
.It Fl -label Ar label
Specifies a string label to attach to new rules, or find in existing rules.
Labels are arbitrary strings that are assigned by convention.
Rule labels are optional.
.It Fl -no-cache
Do not place the outcome of any assessments into the assessment object cache.
No other assessment may reuse this outcome.
This option not prohibit the use of existing cache entries.
.It Fl -path
In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) denote paths to files on disk.
.It Fl -priority Ar priority
In rule update operations, specifies the priority of the rule(s) created or changed.
Priorities are floating-point numbers.
Higher numeric values indicate higher priority.
.It Fl -raw
When displaying the outcome of an assessment, write it as a \&"raw\&" XML plist instead of parsing it
in somewhat more friendly form.
This is useful when used in scripts, or to access newly invented assessment aspects that
.Nm
does not yet know about.
.It Fl -requirement
In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) are code requirement source.
.It Fl -rule
In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) are the index numbers of existing rules.
.It Fl t, -type
Specify which type of assessment is desired:
.Ar execute
to assess code execution,
.Ar install
to assess installation of an installer package, and
.Ar open
to assess the opening of documents.
The default is to assess execution.
.It Fl v, -verbose
Requests more verbose output.
Repeat the option or give it a higher numeric value to increase verbosity.
.El
.Sh RULE SUBJECTS
The system assessement rule database contains entries that match candidates based on
Code Requirements.
.Nm
allows you to specify these requirements directly using the
.Fl -requirement
option.
In addition, individual programs on disk can be addressed with the --path option (which uses their Designated Requirement).
The
.Fl -anchor
option takes the hash of a (full) certificate and turns it into a requirement matching any
signature based on that anchor certificate.
Alternatively, it can take the absolute path of a certificate file on disk, containing the DER form of an anchor certificate.
Finally, the
.Fl -hash
option generates a code requirement that
denotes only and exactly one program whose CodeDirectory hash is given.
The means of specifying subjects does not affect the remaining processing.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/SystemPolicy" -compact
.It Pa /var/db/SystemPolicy
The system policy database.
.It Pa /var/db/.SystemPolicy-default
A copy of the initial distribution version of the system policy database.
Useful for starting over
if the database gets messed up beyond recognition.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To check whether Mail.app is allowed to run on the local system:
.Dl spctl -a /Applications/Mail.app
.Pp
To allow Frobozz.app to run on the local system:
.Dl spctl --add --label \&"My Stuff\&" /Applications/Frobozz.app
.Pp
To forbid all code obtained from the Mac App Store from running:
.Dl spctl --disable --label \&"Mac App Store\&"
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm
exits zero on success, or one if an operation has failed.
Exit code two indicates unrecognized or unsuitable arguments.
If an assessment operation results in denial but no other problem has
occurred, the exit code is three.

.Dt spindump 8
.Os Darwin
.Sh NAME
.Nm spindump 
.Nd Profile entire system during a time interval
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spindump
.Op pid | partial-name Op duration Op interval
.Op <options>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm spindump 
is used by various system components to create reports when an unresponsive application is force quit. Reports are stored at:
.Pp
/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/
.Pp
For normal application force quits spindump will display a dialog to offer the choice to view more details and/or send a report to Apple.
.Pp
-------------------------------------
.Pp
When run manually, spindump samples user and kernel stacks for every process in the system. Spindump supports two display formats for stacks, heavy and timeline, and includes a binary representation of its data at the end of reports for re-reporting with different options (see
.Fl i
). Spindump can also parse reports in timeline format even without a binary representation to re-report them in heavy format.
.Pp
When displayed in
.Nm heavy
format, stacks are sorted by count and each unique stack is displayed once. In this snippet:
.Pp
84  __CFRunLoopRun + 1161 (CoreFoundation + 460665) [0x7fff8d662779]
.Pp
Address 0x7fff8d662779 was sampled 84 times in total, not necessarily consecutively. The address corresponds __CFRunLoopRun in CoreFoundation.
.Pp
When displayed in
.Nm timeline
format, samples are sorted so that the leaf frames in the sample tree are presented in chronological order. Each frame includes a time range of consecutive samples in which the frame was seen, which can be compared with the range of other frames to determine concurrency. If multiple samples of the same stack were not consecutive, the stack will be displayed multiple times. In this snippet:
.Pp
23  __CFRunLoopRun + 1161 (CoreFoundation + 460665) [0x7fff8d662779] 50-72
.Pp
Address 0x7fff8d662779 was sampled 23 times consecutively from the 50th to 72nd sample.
.Pp
In timeline format, spindump notes state changes for threads, e.g.:
.Pp
<darwinbg, timers coalesced>
.Pp
which indicates the change in state for the samples that follow. Any state not mentioned is unchanged from previous samples. The state information spindump reports includes thread QoS, darwinbg, importance inheritance boost, suppression for App Nap, latency QoS (timers), IO throttling tier, and cpu priority.
.Pp
Leaf frames will indicate whether the thread was running/runnable or suspended.
.Pp
A leading star (*) indicates a kernel frame or library.
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Nm pid
or
.Nm partial-name
the process to be sorted topmost in the report. "-notarget" may be used to avoid providing a target process when specifying a duration and interval.
.Pp
.Nm duration
the duration of the sampling in seconds. If not specified, the default of 10 seconds is used.
.Pp
.Nm interval
the number of miliseconds between samples. If not specified, the default of 10 miliseconds is used.
.Pp
.Fl i Ar path
Read in the binary format stored in the spindump file at
.Ar path
and re-report that data rather than sampling the live system. Spindump can also parse the stacks of a timeline formatted report without a binary format in order to re-report them in heavy format, in which case only stacks will be updated; summary information will not change.
.Pp
.Fl indexRange Ar s-e
only include samples in the given range
.Pp
.Fl startIndex Ar s
omit frames before sample number
.Ar s
.Pp
.Fl endIndex Ar e
omit frames after sample number
.Ar e
.Pp
.Fl heavy
sort stacks by count (default)
.Pp
.Fl timeline
sort stacks chronologically
.Pp
.Fl file Ar path
specifies where the report should be written. If
.Ar path
is a file, it will be overwritten. If
.Ar path
is a directory, a file will be created inside that directory with the name following the format <appname>_<pid>.spindump.txt. If a file by that name already exists, spindump will add a unique number to the filename. If not specified, spindump will output reports to files inside /tmp.
.Pp
.Fl wait
wait for the process to exist before sampling. If the process already exists, spindump will begin sampling immediately.
.Pp
.Fl onlyrunnable
only display runnable stacks
.Pp
.Fl onlyblocked
only display non-runnable stacks
.Pp
.Fl onlytarget
only sample the target process (allows faster sampling rates)
.Pp
.Fl proc <proc>
if onlytarget is provided, sample
.Ar proc
as well. This option may be specified multiple times
.Pp
.Fl sampleWithoutTarget
keep sampling for the entire sampling duration even if the target process exits
.Pp
.Fl timelimit Ar t
exit after
.Ar t
seconds even if the report hasn't been saved
.Pp
.Fl stdsout
print the report to stdout
.Pp
.Fl nofile
do not output to a file. Implies -stdout and will include the binary format in the stdout output
.Pp
.Fl open Ar appname
specifies an app in which to open the resulting report
.Pp
.Fl siginfo
after sampling, wait for SIGINFO before generating the report
.Pp
.Fl delayonsignal Ar d
stop sampling
.Ar d
seconds after receiving a signal to stop sampling instead of stopping immediately
.Pp
.Fl threadprioritythreshold t
filter out any threads that have a priority below the given threshold. Pass a negative number to filter out threads that have a priority above the given threshold's absolute value
.Pp
.Fl nothrottle
do not throttle sampling rate on excessive memory growth
.Pp
.Fl noProcessingWhileSampling
do not parse stackshots until done sampling
.Pp
.Fl displayIdleWorkQueueThreads
display idle work queue threads in the textual report (by default they are omitted)

.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-keysign
.Nd ssh helper program for host-based authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used by
.Xr ssh 1
to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature
required during host-based authentication with SSH protocol version 2.
.Pp
.Nm
is disabled by default and can only be enabled in the
global client configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
by setting
.Cm EnableSSHKeysign
to
.Dq yes .
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
.Xr ssh 1 .
See
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr sshd 8
for more information about host-based authentication.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Controls whether
.Nm
is enabled.

.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to
generate the digital signature.
They should be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
Since they are readable only by root,
.Nm
must be set-uid root if host-based authentication is used.
Note that
.Nm
is not set-uid by default on Mac OS X.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key-cert.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub
If these files exist they are assumed to contain public certificate
information corresponding with the private keys above.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for
.Xr ssh 1 .
Together these programs replace rlogin and rsh,
and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
over an insecure network.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for connections from clients.
It is normally started at boot from
.Pa /etc/rc .
It forks a new
daemon for each incoming connection.
The forked daemons handle
key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution,
and data exchange.
.\" Apple:
.Pp
On OS X,
.Nm
is started by
.Xr launchd 8
and controlled by the
.Xr launchd.plist 5
file in
.Pa  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist .
.Pp
.Nm
can be configured using command-line options or a configuration file
(by default
.Xr sshd_config 5 ) ;
command-line options override values specified in the
configuration file.
.Nm
rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
.Dv SIGHUP ,
by executing itself with the name and options it was started with, e.g.\&
.Pa /usr/sbin/sshd .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl b Ar bits
Specifies the number of bits in the ephemeral protocol version 1
server key (default 1024).
.It Fl C Ar connection_spec
Specify the connection parameters to use for the
.Fl T
extended test mode.
If provided, any
.Cm Match
directives in the configuration file
that would apply to the specified user, host, and address will be set before
the configuration is written to standard output.
The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs.
The keywords are
.Dq user ,
.Dq host ,
.Dq laddr ,
.Dq lport ,
and
.Dq addr .
All are required and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple
.Fl C
options or as a comma-separated list.
.It Fl c Ar host_certificate_file
Specifies a path to a certificate file to identify
.Nm
during key exchange.
The certificate file must match a host key file specified using the
.Fl h
option or the
.Cm HostKey
configuration directive.
.It Fl D
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not detach and does not become a daemon.
This allows easy monitoring of
.Nm sshd .
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
The server sends verbose debug output to standard error,
and does not put itself in the background.
The server also will not fork and will only process one connection.
This option is only intended for debugging for the server.
Multiple
.Fl d
options increase the debugging level.
Maximum is 3.
.It Fl E Ar log_file
Append debug logs to
.Ar log_file
instead of the system log.
.It Fl e
Write debug logs to standard error instead of the system log.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Specifies the name of the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config .
.Nm
refuses to start if there is no configuration file.
.It Fl g Ar login_grace_time
Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default
120 seconds).
If the client fails to authenticate the user within
this many seconds, the server disconnects and exits.
A value of zero indicates no limit.
.It Fl h Ar host_key_file
Specifies a file from which a host key is read.
This option must be given if
.Nm
is not run as root (as the normal
host key files are normally not readable by anyone but root).
The default is
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
for protocol version 1, and
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key ,
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key .
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
and
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
for protocol version 2.
It is possible to have multiple host key files for
the different protocol versions and host key algorithms.
.It Fl i
Specifies that
.Nm
is being run from
.Xr inetd 8 .
.Nm
is normally not run
from inetd because it needs to generate the server key before it can
respond to the client, and this may take tens of seconds.
Clients would have to wait too long if the key was regenerated every time.
However, with small key sizes (e.g. 512) using
.Nm
from inetd may
be feasible.
.It Fl k Ar key_gen_time
Specifies how often the ephemeral protocol version 1 server key is
regenerated (default 3600 seconds, or one hour).
The motivation for regenerating the key fairly
often is that the key is not stored anywhere, and after about an hour
it becomes impossible to recover the key for decrypting intercepted
communications even if the machine is cracked into or physically
seized.
A value of zero indicates that the key will never be regenerated.
.It Fl o Ar option
Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.
This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate
command-line flag.
For full details of the options, and their values, see
.Xr sshd_config 5 .
.It Fl p Ar port
Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections
(default 22).
Multiple port options are permitted.
Ports specified in the configuration file with the
.Cm Port
option are ignored when a command-line port is specified.
Ports specified using the
.Cm ListenAddress
option override command-line ports.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Nothing is sent to the system log.
Normally the beginning,
authentication, and termination of each connection is logged.
.It Fl T
Extended test mode.
Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration
to stdout and then exit.
Optionally,
.Cm Match
rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl t
Test mode.
Only check the validity of the configuration file and sanity of the keys.
This is useful for updating
.Nm
reliably as configuration options may change.
.It Fl u Ar len
This option is used to specify the size of the field
in the
.Li utmp
structure that holds the remote host name.
If the resolved host name is longer than
.Ar len ,
the dotted decimal value will be used instead.
This allows hosts with very long host names that
overflow this field to still be uniquely identified.
Specifying
.Fl u0
indicates that only dotted decimal addresses
should be put into the
.Pa utmp
file.
.Fl u0
may also be used to prevent
.Nm
from making DNS requests unless the authentication
mechanism or configuration requires it.
Authentication mechanisms that may require DNS include
.Cm RhostsRSAAuthentication ,
.Cm HostbasedAuthentication ,
and using a
.Cm from="pattern-list"
option in a key file.
Configuration options that require DNS include using a
USER@HOST pattern in
.Cm AllowUsers
or
.Cm DenyUsers .
.El
.Sh AUTHENTICATION
The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocols 1 and 2.
The default is to use protocol 2 only,
though this can be changed via the
.Cm Protocol
option in
.Xr sshd_config 5 .
Protocol 2 supports DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 and RSA keys;
protocol 1 only supports RSA keys.
For both protocols,
each host has a host-specific key,
normally 2048 bits,
used to identify the host.
.Pp
Forward security for protocol 1 is provided through
an additional server key,
normally 768 bits,
generated when the server starts.
This key is normally regenerated every hour if it has been used, and
is never stored on disk.
Whenever a client connects, the daemon responds with its public
host and server keys.
The client compares the
RSA host key against its own database to verify that it has not changed.
The client then generates a 256-bit random number.
It encrypts this
random number using both the host key and the server key, and sends
the encrypted number to the server.
Both sides then use this
random number as a session key which is used to encrypt all further
communications in the session.
The rest of the session is encrypted
using a conventional cipher, currently Blowfish or 3DES, with 3DES
being used by default.
The client selects the encryption algorithm
to use from those offered by the server.
.Pp
For protocol 2,
forward security is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
This key agreement results in a shared session key.
The rest of the session is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, currently
128-bit AES, Blowfish, 3DES, CAST128, Arcfour, 192-bit AES, or 256-bit AES.
The client selects the encryption algorithm
to use from those offered by the server.
Additionally, session integrity is provided
through a cryptographic message authentication code
(hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, umac-64, umac-128, hmac-ripemd160,
hmac-sha2-256 or hmac-sha2-512).
.Pp
Finally, the server and the client enter an authentication dialog.
The client tries to authenticate itself using
host-based authentication,
public key authentication,
challenge-response authentication,
or password authentication.
.Pp
Regardless of the authentication type, the account is checked to
ensure that it is accessible.  An account is not accessible if it is
locked, listed in
.Cm DenyUsers
or its group is listed in
.Cm DenyGroups
\&.  The definition of a locked account is system dependant. Some platforms
have their own account database (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field (
.Ql \&*LK\&*
on Solaris and UnixWare,
.Ql \&*
on HP-UX, containing
.Ql Nologin
on Tru64,
a leading
.Ql \&*LOCKED\&*
on FreeBSD and a leading
.Ql \&!
on most Linuxes).
If there is a requirement to disable password authentication
for the account while allowing still public-key, then the passwd field
should be set to something other than these values (eg
.Ql NP
or
.Ql \&*NP\&*
).
.Pp
If the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for
preparing the session is entered.
At this time the client may request
things like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections,
forwarding TCP connections, or forwarding the authentication agent
connection over the secure channel.
.Pp
After this, the client either requests a shell or execution of a command.
The sides then enter session mode.
In this mode, either side may send
data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or
command on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.
.Pp
When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other
connections have been closed, the server sends command exit status to
the client, and both sides exit.
.Sh LOGIN PROCESS
When a user successfully logs in,
.Nm
does the following:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
If the login is on a tty, and no command has been specified,
prints last login time and
.Pa /etc/motd
(unless prevented in the configuration file or by
.Pa ~/.hushlogin ;
see the
.Sx FILES
section).
.It
If the login is on a tty, records login time.
.It
Checks
.Pa /etc/nologin ;
if it exists, prints contents and quits
(unless root).
.It
Changes to run with normal user privileges.
.It
Sets up basic environment.
.It
Reads the file
.Pa ~/.ssh/environment ,
if it exists, and users are allowed to change their environment.
See the
.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
option in
.Xr sshd_config 5 .
.It
Changes to user's home directory.
.It
If
.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
exists and the
.Xr sshd_config 5
.Cm PermitUserRC
option is set, runs it; else if
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
exists, runs
it; otherwise runs xauth.
The
.Dq rc
files are given the X11
authentication protocol and cookie in standard input.
See
.Sx SSHRC ,
below.
.It
Runs user's shell or command.
All commands are run under the user's login shell as specified in the
system password database.
.El
.Sh SSHRC
If the file
.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
exists,
.Xr sh 1
runs it after reading the
environment files but before starting the user's shell or command.
It must not produce any output on stdout; stderr must be used
instead.
If X11 forwarding is in use, it will receive the "proto cookie" pair in
its standard input (and
.Ev DISPLAY
in its environment).
The script must call
.Xr xauth 1
because
.Nm
will not run xauth automatically to add X11 cookies.
.Pp
The primary purpose of this file is to run any initialization routines
which may be needed before the user's home directory becomes
accessible; AFS is a particular example of such an environment.
.Pp
This file will probably contain some initialization code followed by
something similar to:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
if read proto cookie && [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then
	if [ `echo $DISPLAY | cut -c1-10` = 'localhost:' ]; then
		# X11UseLocalhost=yes
		echo add unix:`echo $DISPLAY |
		    cut -c11-` $proto $cookie
	else
		# X11UseLocalhost=no
		echo add $DISPLAY $proto $cookie
	fi | xauth -q -
fi
.Ed
.Pp
If this file does not exist,
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
is run, and if that
does not exist either, xauth is used to add the cookie.
.Sh AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT
.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
specifies the files containing public keys for
public key authentication;
if none is specified, the default is
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
and
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 .
Each line of the file contains one
key (empty lines and lines starting with a
.Ql #
are ignored as
comments).
Protocol 1 public keys consist of the following space-separated fields:
options, bits, exponent, modulus, comment.
Protocol 2 public key consist of:
options, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.
The options field is optional;
its presence is determined by whether the line starts
with a number or not (the options field never starts with a number).
The bits, exponent, modulus, and comment fields give the RSA key for
protocol version 1; the
comment field is not used for anything (but may be convenient for the
user to identify the key).
For protocol version 2 the keytype is
.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ,
.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 ,
.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 ,
.Dq ssh-ed25519 ,
.Dq ssh-dss
or
.Dq ssh-rsa .
.Pp
Note that lines in this file are usually several hundred bytes long
(because of the size of the public key encoding) up to a limit of
8 kilobytes, which permits DSA keys up to 8 kilobits and RSA
keys up to 16 kilobits.
You don't want to type them in; instead, copy the
.Pa identity.pub ,
.Pa id_dsa.pub ,
.Pa id_ecdsa.pub ,
.Pa id_ed25519.pub ,
or the
.Pa id_rsa.pub
file and edit it.
.Pp
.Nm
enforces a minimum RSA key modulus size for protocol 1
and protocol 2 keys of 768 bits.
.Pp
The options (if present) consist of comma-separated option
specifications.
No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.
The following option specifications are supported (note
that option keywords are case-insensitive):
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm cert-authority
Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority (CA) that is
trusted to validate signed certificates for user authentication.
.Pp
Certificates may encode access restrictions similar to these key options.
If both certificate restrictions and key options are present, the most
restrictive union of the two is applied.
.It Cm command="command"
Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for
authentication.
The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored.
The command is run on a pty if the client requests a pty;
otherwise it is run without a tty.
If an 8-bit clean channel is required,
one must not request a pty or should specify
.Cm no-pty .
A quote may be included in the command by quoting it with a backslash.
This option might be useful
to restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.
An example might be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else.
Note that the client may specify TCP and/or X11
forwarding unless they are explicitly prohibited.
The command originally supplied by the client is available in the
.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
environment variable.
Note that this option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.
Also note that this command may be superseded by either a
.Xr sshd_config 5
.Cm ForceCommand
directive or a command embedded in a certificate.
.It Cm environment="NAME=value"
Specifies that the string is to be added to the environment when
logging in using this key.
Environment variables set this way
override other default environment values.
Multiple options of this type are permitted.
Environment processing is disabled by default and is
controlled via the
.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
option.
This option is automatically disabled if
.Cm UseLogin
is enabled.
.It Cm from="pattern-list"
Specifies that in addition to public key authentication, either the canonical
name of the remote host or its IP address must be present in the
comma-separated list of patterns.
See PATTERNS in
.Xr ssh_config 5
for more information on patterns.
.Pp
In addition to the wildcard matching that may be applied to hostnames or
addresses, a
.Cm from
stanza may match IP addresses using CIDR address/masklen notation.
.Pp
The purpose of this option is to optionally increase security: public key
authentication by itself does not trust the network or name servers or
anything (but the key); however, if somebody somehow steals the key, the key
permits an intruder to log in from anywhere in the world.
This additional option makes using a stolen key more difficult (name
servers and/or routers would have to be compromised in addition to
just the key).
.It Cm no-agent-forwarding
Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for
authentication.
.It Cm no-port-forwarding
Forbids TCP forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
Any port forward requests by the client will return an error.
This might be used, e.g. in connection with the
.Cm command
option.
.It Cm no-pty
Prevents tty allocation (a request to allocate a pty will fail).
.It Cm no-user-rc
Disables execution of
.Pa ~/.ssh/rc .
.It Cm no-X11-forwarding
Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
Any X11 forward requests by the client will return an error.
.It Cm permitopen="host:port"
Limit local port forwarding with
.Xr ssh 1
.Fl L
such that it may only connect to the specified host and port.
IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.
Multiple
.Cm permitopen
options may be applied separated by commas.
No pattern matching is performed on the specified hostnames,
they must be literal domains or addresses.
A port specification of
.Cm *
matches any port.
.It Cm principals="principals"
On a
.Cm cert-authority
line, specifies allowed principals for certificate authentication as a
comma-separated list.
At least one name from the list must appear in the certificate's
list of principals for the certificate to be accepted.
This option is ignored for keys that are not marked as trusted certificate
signers using the
.Cm cert-authority
option.
.It Cm tunnel="n"
Force a
.Xr tun 4
device on the server.
Without this option, the next available device will be used if
the client requests a tunnel.
.El

.Ed
.Sh SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT
The
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
and
.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
files contain host public keys for all known hosts.
The global file should
be prepared by the administrator (optional), and the per-user file is
maintained automatically: whenever the user connects from an unknown host,
its key is added to the per-user file.
.Pp
Each line in these files contains the following fields: markers (optional),
hostnames, bits, exponent, modulus, comment.
The fields are separated by spaces.
.Pp
The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one of
.Dq @cert-authority ,
to indicate that the line contains a certification authority (CA) key,
or
.Dq @revoked ,
to indicate that the key contained on the line is revoked and must not ever
be accepted.
Only one marker should be used on a key line.
.Pp
Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns
.Pf ( Ql *
and
.Ql \&?
act as
wildcards); each pattern in turn is matched against the canonical host
name (when authenticating a client) or against the user-supplied
name (when authenticating a server).
A pattern may also be preceded by
.Ql \&!
to indicate negation: if the host name matches a negated
pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if it matched another
pattern on the line.
A hostname or address may optionally be enclosed within
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&]
brackets then followed by
.Ql \&:
and a non-standard port number.
.Pp
Alternately, hostnames may be stored in a hashed form which hides host names
and addresses should the file's contents be disclosed.
Hashed hostnames start with a
.Ql |
character.
Only one hashed hostname may appear on a single line and none of the above
negation or wildcard operators may be applied.
.Pp
Bits, exponent, and modulus are taken directly from the RSA host key; they
can be obtained, for example, from
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub .
The optional comment field continues to the end of the line, and is not used.
.Pp
Lines starting with
.Ql #
and empty lines are ignored as comments.
.Pp
When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if any
matching line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or,
if the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key
of the certification authority that signed the certificate.
For a key to be trusted as a certification authority, it must use the
.Dq @cert-authority
marker described above.
.Pp
The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as revoked,
for example when it is known that the associated private key has been
stolen.
Revoked keys are specified by including the
.Dq @revoked
marker at the beginning of the key line, and are never accepted for
authentication or as certification authorities, but instead will
produce a warning from
.Xr ssh 1
when they are encountered.
.Pp
It is permissible (but not
recommended) to have several lines or different host keys for the same
names.
This will inevitably happen when short forms of host names
from different domains are put in the file.
It is possible
that the files contain conflicting information; authentication is
accepted if valid information can be found from either file.
.Pp
Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of characters
long, and you definitely don't want to type in the host keys by hand.
Rather, generate them by a script,
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
or by taking
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
and adding the host names at the front.
.Xr ssh-keygen 1
also offers some basic automated editing for
.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
including removing hosts matching a host name and converting all host
names to their hashed representations.
.Pp
An example ssh_known_hosts file:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# Comments allowed at start of line
closenet,...,192.0.2.53 1024 37 159...93 closenet.example.net
cvs.example.net,192.0.2.10 ssh-rsa AAAA1234.....=
# A hashed hostname
|1|JfKTdBh7rNbXkVAQCRp4OQoPfmI=|USECr3SWf1JUPsms5AqfD5QfxkM= ssh-rsa
AAAA1234.....=
# A revoked key

# A CA key, accepted for any host in *.mydomain.com or *.mydomain.org

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa ~/.hushlogin
This file is used to suppress printing the last login time and
.Pa /etc/motd ,
if
.Cm PrintLastLog
and
.Cm PrintMotd ,
respectively,
are enabled.
It does not suppress printing of the banner specified by
.Cm Banner .
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.rhosts
This file is used for host-based authentication (see
.Xr ssh 1
for more information).
On some machines this file may need to be
world-readable if the user's home directory is on an NFS partition,
because
.Nm
reads it as root.
Additionally, this file must be owned by the user,
and must not have write permissions for anyone else.
The recommended
permission for most machines is read/write for the user, and not
accessible by others.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.shosts
This file is used in exactly the same way as
.Pa .rhosts ,
but allows host-based authentication without permitting login with
rlogin/rsh.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.ssh/
This directory is the default location for all user-specific configuration
and authentication information.
There is no general requirement to keep the entire contents of this directory
secret, but the recommended permissions are read/write/execute for the user,
and not accessible by others.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Lists the public keys (DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA)
that can be used for logging in as this user.
The format of this file is described above.
The content of the file is not highly sensitive, but the recommended
permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.
.Pp
If this file, the
.Pa ~/.ssh
directory, or the user's home directory are writable
by other users, then the file could be modified or replaced by unauthorized
users.
In this case,
.Nm
will not allow it to be used unless the
.Cm StrictModes
option has been set to
.Dq no .
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.ssh/environment
This file is read into the environment at login (if it exists).
It can only contain empty lines, comment lines (that start with
.Ql # ) ,
and assignment lines of the form name=value.
The file should be writable
only by the user; it need not be readable by anyone else.
Environment processing is disabled by default and is
controlled via the
.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
option.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into
that are not already in the systemwide list of known host keys.
The format of this file is described above.
This file should be writable only by root/the owner and
can, but need not be, world-readable.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.ssh/rc
Contains initialization routines to be run before
the user's home directory becomes accessible.
This file should be writable only by the user, and need not be
readable by anyone else.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/hosts.equiv
This file is for host-based authentication (see
.Xr ssh 1 ) .
It should only be writable by root.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/moduli
Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for the "Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange".
The file format is described in
.Xr moduli 5 .
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/motd
See
.Xr motd 5 .
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/nologin
If this file exists,
.Nm
refuses to let anyone except root log in.
The contents of the file
are displayed to anyone trying to log in, and non-root connections are
refused.
The file should be world-readable.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/shosts.equiv
This file is used in exactly the same way as
.Pa hosts.equiv ,
but allows host-based authentication without permitting login with
rlogin/rsh.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
These files contain the private parts of the host keys.
These files should only be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
Note that
.Nm
does not start if these files are group/world-accessible.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
These files contain the public parts of the host keys.
These files should be world-readable but writable only by
root.
Their contents should match the respective private parts.
These files are not
really used for anything; they are provided for the convenience of
the user so their contents can be copied to known hosts files.
These files are created using
.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
Systemwide list of known host keys.
This file should be prepared by the
system administrator to contain the public host keys of all machines in the
organization.
The format of this file is described above.
This file should be writable only by root/the owner and
should be world-readable.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Contains configuration data for
.Nm sshd .
The file format and configuration options are described in
.Xr sshd_config 5 .
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
Similar to
.Pa ~/.ssh/rc ,
it can be used to specify
machine-specific login-time initializations globally.
This file should be writable only by root, and should be world-readable.
.Pp
.It Pa /var/empty
.Xr chroot 2
directory used by
.Nm
during privilege separation in the pre-authentication phase.
The directory should not contain any files and must be owned by root
and not group or world-writable.
.Pp
.It Pa /var/run/sshd.pid
Contains the process ID of the
.Nm
listening for connections (if there are several daemons running
concurrently for different ports, this contains the process ID of the one
started last).
The content of this file is not sensitive; it can be world-readable.
