Git v1.8.1 Release Notes
========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

In the next major release (not *this* one), we will change the
behavior of the "git push" command.

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  We will use the "simple" semantics that pushes the
current branch to the branch with the same name, only when the current
branch is set to integrate with that remote branch.  There is a user
preference configuration variable "push.default" to change this, and
"git push" will warn about the upcoming change until you set this
variable in this release.

"git branch --set-upstream" is deprecated and may be removed in a
relatively distant future.  "git branch [-u|--set-upstream-to]" has
been introduced with a saner order of arguments to replace it.


Updates since v1.8.0
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Command-line completion scripts for tcsh and zsh have been added.

 * "git-prompt" scriptlet (in contrib/completion) can be told to paint
   pieces of the hints in the prompt string in colors.

 * Some documentation pages that used to ship only in the plain text
   format are now formatted in HTML as well.

 * We used to have a workaround for a bug in ancient "less" that
   causes it to exit without any output when the terminal is resized.
   The bug has been fixed in "less" version 406 (June 2007), and the
   workaround has been removed in this release.

 * When "git checkout" checks out a branch, it tells the user how far
   behind (or ahead) the new branch is relative to the remote tracking
   branch it builds upon.  The message now also advises how to sync
   them up by pushing or pulling.  This can be disabled with the
   advice.statusHints configuration variable.

 * "git config --get" used to diagnose presence of multiple
   definitions of the same variable in the same configuration file as
   an error, but it now applies the "last one wins" rule used by the
   internal configuration logic.  Strictly speaking, this may be an
   API regression but it is expected that nobody will notice it in
   practice.

 * A new configuration variable "diff.context" can be used to
   give the default number of context lines in the patch output, to
   override the hardcoded default of 3 lines.

 * "git format-patch" learned the "--notes=<ref>" option to give
   notes for the commit after the three-dash lines in its output.

 * "git log -p -S<string>" now looks for the <string> after applying
   the textconv filter (if defined); earlier it inspected the contents
   of the blobs without filtering.

 * "git log --grep=<pcre>" learned to honor the "grep.patterntype"
   configuration set to "perl".

 * "git replace -d <object>" now interprets <object> as an extended
   SHA-1 (e.g. HEAD~4 is allowed), instead of only accepting full hex
   object name.

 * "git rm $submodule" used to punt on removing a submodule working
   tree to avoid losing the repository embedded in it.  Because
   recent git uses a mechanism to separate the submodule repository
   from the submodule working tree, "git rm" learned to detect this
   case and removes the submodule working tree when it is safe to do so.

 * "git send-email" used to prompt for the sender address, even when
   the committer identity is well specified (e.g. via user.name and
   user.email configuration variables).  The command no longer gives
   this prompt when not necessary.

 * "git send-email" did not allow non-address garbage strings to
   appear after addresses on Cc: lines in the patch files (and when
   told to pick them up to find more recipients), e.g.

     Cc: Stable Kernel <stable@k.org> # for v3.2 and up

   The command now strips " # for v3.2 and up" part before adding the
   remainder of this line to the list of recipients.

 * "git submodule add" learned to add a new submodule at the same
   path as the path where an unrelated submodule was bound to in an
   existing revision via the "--name" option.

 * "git submodule sync" learned the "--recursive" option.

 * "diff.submodule" configuration variable can be used to give custom
   default value to the "git diff --submodule" option.

 * "git symbolic-ref" learned the "-d $symref" option to delete the
   named symbolic ref, which is more intuitive way to spell it than
   "update-ref -d --no-deref $symref".


Foreign Interface

 * "git cvsimport" can be told to record timezones (other than GMT)
   per-author via its author info file.

 * The remote helper interface to interact with subversion
   repositories (one of the GSoC 2012 projects) has been merged.

 * A new remote-helper interface for Mercurial has been added to
   contrib/remote-helpers.

 * The documentation for git(1) was pointing at a page at an external
   site for the list of authors that no longer existed.  The link has
   been updated to point at an alternative site.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * Compilation on Cygwin with newer header files are supported now.

 * A couple of low-level implementation updates on MinGW.

 * The logic to generate the initial advertisement from "upload-pack"
   (i.e. what is invoked by "git fetch" on the other side of the
   connection) to list what refs are available in the repository has
   been optimized.

 * The logic to find set of attributes that match a given path has
   been optimized.

 * Use preloadindex in "git diff-index" and "git update-index", which
   has a nice speedup on systems with slow stat calls (and even on
   Linux).


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.0
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.0 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * The configuration parser had an unnecessary hardcoded limit on
   variable names that was not checked consistently.

 * The "say" function in the test scaffolding incorrectly allowed
   "echo" to interpret "\a" as if it were a C-string asking for a
   BEL output.

 * "git mergetool" feeds /dev/null as a common ancestor when dealing
   with an add/add conflict, but p4merge backend cannot handle
   it. Work it around by passing a temporary empty file.

 * "git log -F -E --grep='<ere>'" failed to use the given <ere>
   pattern as extended regular expression, and instead looked for the
   string literally.

 * "git grep -e pattern <tree>" asked the attribute system to read
   "<tree>:.gitattributes" file in the working tree, which was
   nonsense.

 * A symbolic ref refs/heads/SYM was not correctly removed with "git
   branch -d SYM"; the command removed the ref pointed by SYM
   instead.

 * Update "remote tracking branch" in the documentation to
   "remote-tracking branch".

 * "git pull --rebase" run while the HEAD is detached tried to find
   the upstream branch of the detached HEAD (which by definition
   does not exist) and emitted unnecessary error messages.

 * The refs/replace hierarchy was not mentioned in the
   repository-layout docs.

 * Various rfc2047 quoting issues around a non-ASCII name on the
   From: line in the output from format-patch have been corrected.

 * Sometimes curl_multi_timeout() function suggested a wrong timeout
   value when there is no file descriptor to wait on and the http
   transport ended up sleeping for minutes in select(2) system call.
   A workaround has been added for this.

 * For a fetch refspec (or the result of applying wildcard on one),
   we always want the RHS to map to something inside "refs/"
   hierarchy, but the logic to check it was not exactly right.
   (merge 5c08c1f jc/maint-fetch-tighten-refname-check later to maint).

 * "git diff -G<pattern>" did not honor textconv filter when looking
   for changes.

 * Some HTTP servers ask for auth only during the actual packing phase
   (not in ls-remote phase); this is not really a recommended
   configuration, but the clients used to fail to authenticate with
   such servers.
   (merge 2e736fd jk/maint-http-half-auth-fetch later to maint).

 * "git p4" used to try expanding malformed "$keyword$" that spans
   across multiple lines.

 * Syntax highlighting in "gitweb" was not quite working.

 * RSS feed from "gitweb" had a xss hole in its title output.

 * "git config --path $key" segfaulted on "[section] key" (a boolean
   "true" spelled without "=", not "[section] key = true").

 * "git checkout -b foo" while on an unborn branch did not say
   "Switched to a new branch 'foo'" like other cases.

 * Various codepaths have workaround for a common misconfiguration to
   spell "UTF-8" as "utf8", but it was not used uniformly.  Most
   notably, mailinfo (which is used by "git am") lacked this support.

 * We failed to mention a file without any content change but whose
   permission bit was modified, or (worse yet) a new file without any
   content in the "git diff --stat" output.

 * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for binary contents, the total
   number of added and removed lines at the bottom was computed
   incorrectly.

 * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for unmerged paths, the total
   number of affected files at the bottom of the "diff --stat" output
   was computed incorrectly.

 * "diff --shortstat" miscounted the total number of affected files
   when there were unmerged paths.

 * "update-ref -d --deref SYM" to delete a ref through a symbolic ref
   that points to it did not remove it correctly.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2
------------------

 * An earlier change to the attribute system introduced at v1.8.1.2 by
   mistake stopped a pattern "dir" (without trailing slash) from
   matching a directory "dir" (it only wanted to allow pattern "dir/"
   to also match).

 * Verification of signed tags were not done correctly when not in C
   or en/US locale.

 * 'git commit -m "$msg"' used to add an extra newline even when
   $msg already ended with one.

 * The "--match=<pattern>" option of "git describe", when used with
   "--all" to allow refs that are not annotated tags to be used as a
   base of description, did not restrict the output from the command
   to those that match the given pattern.

 * An aliased command spawned from a bare repository that does not say
   it is bare with "core.bare = yes" is treated as non-bare by mistake.

 * When "format-patch" quoted a non-ascii strings on the header files,
   it incorrectly applied rfc2047 and chopped a single character in
   the middle of it.

 * "git archive" reports a failure when asked to create an archive out
   of an empty tree.  It would be more intuitive to give an empty
   archive back in such a case.

 * "git tag -f <tag>" always said "Updated tag '<tag>'" even when
   creating a new tag (i.e. not overwriting nor updating).

 * "git cmd -- ':(top'" was not diagnosed as an invalid syntax, and
   instead the parser kept reading beyond the end of the string.

 * Annotated tags outside refs/tags/ hierarchy were not advertised
   correctly to the ls-remote and fetch with recent version of Git.

 * The code to keep track of what directory names are known to Git on
   platforms with case insensitive filesystems can get confused upon a
   hash collision between these pathnames and looped forever.

 * The logic used by "git diff -M --stat" to shorten the names of
   files before and after a rename did not work correctly when the
   common prefix and suffix between the two filenames overlapped.

 * "git submodule update", when recursed into sub-submodules, did not
   accumulate the prefix paths.

 * "git am $maildir/" applied messages in an unexpected order; sort
   filenames read from the maildir/ in a way that is more likely to
   sort messages in the order the writing MUA meant to, by sorting
   numeric segment in numeric order and non-numeric segment in
   alphabetical order.

 * When export-subst is used, "zip" output recorded incorrect
   size of the file.

 * Some platforms and users spell UTF-8 differently; retry with the
   most official "UTF-8" when the system does not understand the
   user-supplied encoding name that are the common alternative
   spellings of UTF-8.

 * "git branch" did not bother to check nonsense command line
   parameters and issue errors in many cases.

 * "git update-index -h" did not do the usual "-h(elp)" thing.

 * perl/Git.pm::cat_blob slurped everything in core only to write it
   out to a file descriptor, which was not a very smart thing to do.

 * The SSL peer verification done by "git imap-send" did not ask for
   Server Name Indication (RFC 4366), failing to connect SSL/TLS
   sites that serve multiple hostnames on a single IP.

 * "git index-pack" had a buffer-overflow while preparing an
   informational message when the translated version of it was too
   long.

 * Clarify in the documentation "what" gets pushed to "where" when the
   command line to "git push" does not say these explicitly.

 * In "git reflog expire", REACHABLE bit was not cleared from the
   correct objects.

 * The "--color=<when>" argument to the commands in the diff family
   was described poorly.

 * The arguments given to pre-rebase hook were not documented.

 * The v4 index format was not documented.

 * The "--match=<pattern>" argument "git describe" takes uses glob
   pattern but it wasn't obvious from the documentation.

 * Some sources failed to compile on systems that lack NI_MAXHOST in
   their system header (e.g. z/OS).

 * Add an example use of "--env-filter" in "filter-branch"
   documentation.

 * "git bundle verify" did not say "records a complete history" for a
   bundle that does not have any prerequisites.

 * In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
   to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
   CGit from sideways bypassing the entry points of the API the
   in-tree users use.

 * "git merge-tree" had a typo in the logic to detect d/f conflicts,
   which caused it to segfault in some cases.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2.1
--------------------

 * Zsh completion forgot that '%' character used to signal untracked
   files needs to be escaped with another '%'.

 * A commit object whose author or committer ident are malformed
   crashed some code that trusted that a name, an email and an
   timestamp can always be found in it.

 * The new core.commentchar configuration was not applied to a few
   places.

 * "git pull --rebase" did not pass "-v/-q" options to underlying
   "git rebase".

 * When receive-pack detects error in the pack header it received in
   order to decide which of unpack-objects or index-pack to run, it
   returned without closing the error stream, which led to a hang
   sideband thread.

 * "git diff --diff-algorithm=algo" was understood by the command line
   parser, but "git diff --diff-algorithm algo" was not.

 * "git log -S/-G" started paying attention to textconv filter, but
   there was no way to disable this.  Make it honor --no-textconv
   option.

 * "git merge $(git rev-parse v1.8.2)" behaved quite differently from
   "git merge v1.8.2", as if v1.8.2 were written as v1.8.2^0 and did
   not pay much attention to the annotated tag payload.  Make the code
   notice the type of the tag object, in addition to the dwim_ref()
   based classification the current code uses (i.e. the name appears
   in refs/tags/) to decide when to special case merging of tags.

 * "git cherry-pick" and "git revert" can take more than one commit
   on the command line these days, but it was not mentioned on the usage
   text.

 * Perl scripts like "git-svn" closed (not redirecting to /dev/null)
   the standard error stream, which is not a very smart thing to do.
   Later open may return file descriptor #2 for unrelated purpose, and
   error reporting code may write into them.

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" was not prepared to see a line getting
   longer after fixing whitespaces (e.g. tab-in-indent aka Python).

 * "git diff/log --cc" did not work well with options that ignore
   whitespace changes.

 * Documentation on setting up a http server that requires
   authentication only on the push but not fetch has been clarified.

 * A few bugfixes to "git rerere" working on corner case merge
   conflicts have been applied.

 * "git bundle" did not like a bundle created using a commit without
   any message as its one of the prerequisites.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2.2
--------------------

 * "rev-list --stdin" and friends kept bogus pointers into the input
   buffer around as human readable object names.  This was not a
   huge problem but was exposed by a new change that uses these
   names in error output.

 * When "git difftool" drove "kdiff3", it mistakenly passed --auto
   option that was meant while resolving merge conflicts.

 * "git remote add" command did not diagnose extra command line
   arguments as an error and silently ignored them.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.

========================

Backward compatibility notes (this release)
-------------------------------------------

"git push $there tag v1.2.3" used to allow replacing a tag v1.2.3
that already exists in the repository $there, if the rewritten tag
you are pushing points at a commit that is a descendant of a commit
that the old tag v1.2.3 points at.  This was found to be error prone
and starting with this release, any attempt to update an existing
ref under refs/tags/ hierarchy will fail, without "--force".

When "git add -u" and "git add -A" that does not specify what paths
to add on the command line is run from inside a subdirectory, the
scope of the operation has always been limited to the subdirectory.
Many users found this counter-intuitive, given that "git commit -a"
and other commands operate on the entire tree regardless of where you
are.  In this release, these commands give a warning message that
suggests the users to use "git add -u/-A ." when they want to limit
the scope to the current directory; doing so will squelch the message,
while training their fingers.


Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0)
------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics that pushes the current branch to the branch with the same
name, only when the current branch is set to integrate with that
remote branch.  There is a user preference configuration variable
"push.default" to change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used
to the "matching" semantics, you can set it to "matching" to keep the
traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future early,
you can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" and "git add -A", that does not specify what paths
to add on the command line is run from inside a subdirectory, these
commands will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands. Because there will be no
mechanism to make "git add -u" behave as if "git add -u .", it is
important for those who are used to "git add -u" (without pathspec)
updating the index only for paths in the current subdirectory to start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ." when they mean
it before Git 2.0 comes.


Updates since v1.8.1
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Initial ports to QNX and z/OS UNIX System Services have started.

 * Output from the tests is coloured using "green is okay, yellow is
   questionable, red is bad and blue is informative" scheme.

 * Mention of "GIT/Git/git" in the documentation have been updated to
   be more uniform and consistent.  The name of the system and the
   concept it embodies is "Git"; the command the users type is "git".
   All-caps "GIT" was merely a way to imitate "Git" typeset in small
   caps in our ASCII text only documentation and to be avoided.

 * The completion script (in contrib/completion) used to let the
   default completer to suggest pathnames, which gave too many
   irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add" would not want to add an
   unmodified path).  It learnt to use a more git-aware logic to
   enumerate only relevant ones.

 * In bare repositories, "git shortlog" and other commands now read
   mailmap files from the tip of the history, to help running these
   tools in server settings.

 * Color specifiers, e.g. "%C(blue)Hello%C(reset)", used in the
   "--format=" option of "git log" and friends can be disabled when
   the output is not sent to a terminal by prefixing them with
   "auto,", e.g. "%C(auto,blue)Hello%C(auto,reset)".

 * Scripts can ask Git that wildcard patterns in pathspecs they give do
   not have any significance, i.e. take them as literal strings.

 * The patterns in .gitignore and .gitattributes files can have **/,
   as a pattern that matches 0 or more levels of subdirectory.
   E.g. "foo/**/bar" matches "bar" in "foo" itself or in a
   subdirectory of "foo".

 * When giving arguments without "--" disambiguation, object names
   that come earlier on the command line must not be interpretable as
   pathspecs and pathspecs that come later on the command line must
   not be interpretable as object names.  This disambiguation rule has
   been tweaked so that ":/" (no other string before or after) is
   always interpreted as a pathspec; "git cmd -- :/" is no longer
   needed, you can just say "git cmd :/".

 * Various "hint" lines Git gives when it asks the user to edit
   messages in the editor are commented out with '#' by default. The
   core.commentchar configuration variable can be used to customize
   this '#' to a different character.

 * "git add -u" and "git add -A" without pathspec issues warning to
   make users aware that they are only operating on paths inside the
   subdirectory they are in.  Use ":/" (everything from the top) or
   "." (everything from the $cwd) to disambiguate.

 * "git blame" (and "git diff") learned the "--no-follow" option.

 * "git branch" now rejects some nonsense combinations of command line
   arguments (e.g. giving more than one branch name to rename) with
   more case-specific error messages.

 * "git check-ignore" command to help debugging .gitignore files has
   been added.

 * "git cherry-pick" can be used to replay a root commit to an unborn
   branch.

 * "git commit" can be told to use --cleanup=whitespace by setting the
   configuration variable commit.cleanup to 'whitespace'.

 * "git diff" and other Porcelain commands can be told to use a
   non-standard algorithm by setting diff.algorithm configuration
   variable.

 * "git fetch --mirror" and fetch that uses other forms of refspec
   with wildcard used to attempt to update a symbolic ref that match
   the wildcard on the receiving end, which made little sense (the
   real ref that is pointed at by the symbolic ref would be updated
   anyway).  Symbolic refs no longer are affected by such a fetch.

 * "git format-patch" now detects more cases in which a whole branch
   is being exported, and uses the description for the branch, when
   asked to write a cover letter for the series.

 * "git format-patch" learned "-v $count" option, and prepends a
   string "v$count-" to the names of its output files, and also
   automatically sets the subject prefix to "PATCH v$count". This
   allows patches from rerolled series to be stored under different
   names and makes it easier to reuse cover letter messages.

 * "git log" and friends can be told with --use-mailmap option to
   rewrite the names and email addresses of people using the mailmap
   mechanism.

 * "git log --cc --graph" now shows the combined diff output with the
   ancestry graph.

 * "git log --grep=<pattern>" honors i18n.logoutputencoding to look
   for the pattern after fixing the log message to the specified
   encoding.

 * "git mergetool" and "git difftool" learned to list the available
   tool backends in a more consistent manner.

 * "git mergetool" is aware of TortoiseGitMerge now and uses it over
   TortoiseMerge when available.

 * "git push" now requires "-f" to update a tag, even if it is a
   fast-forward, as tags are meant to be fixed points.

 * Error messages from "git push" when it stops to prevent remote refs
   from getting overwritten by mistake have been improved to explain
   various situations separately.

 * "git push" will stop without doing anything if the new "pre-push"
   hook exists and exits with a failure.

 * When "git rebase" fails to generate patches to be applied (e.g. due
   to oom), it failed to detect the failure and instead behaved as if
   there were nothing to do.  A workaround to use a temporary file has
   been applied, but we probably would want to revisit this later, as
   it hurts the common case of not failing at all.

 * Input and preconditions to "git reset" has been loosened where
   appropriate.  "git reset $fromtree Makefile" requires $fromtree to
   be any tree (it used to require it to be a commit), for example.
   "git reset" (without options or parameters) used to error out when
   you do not have any commits in your history, but it now gives you
   an empty index (to match non-existent commit you are not even on).

 * "git status" says what branch is being bisected or rebased when
   able, not just "bisecting" or "rebasing".

 * "git submodule" started learning a new mode to integrate with the
   tip of the remote branch (as opposed to integrating with the commit
   recorded in the superproject's gitlink).

 * "git upload-pack" which implements the service "ls-remote" and
   "fetch" talk to can be told to hide ref hierarchies the server
   side internally uses (and that clients have no business learning
   about) with transfer.hiderefs configuration.


Foreign Interface

 * "git fast-export" has been updated for its use in the context of
   the remote helper interface.

 * A new remote helper to interact with bzr has been added to contrib/.

 * "git p4" got various bugfixes around its branch handling.  It is
   also made usable with Python 2.4/2.5.  In addition, its various
   portability issues for Cygwin have been addressed.

 * The remote helper to interact with Hg in contrib/ has seen a few
   fixes.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * "git fsck" has been taught to be pickier about entries in tree
   objects that should not be there, e.g. ".", ".git", and "..".

 * Matching paths with common forms of pathspecs that contain wildcard
   characters has been optimized further.

 * We stopped paying attention to $GIT_CONFIG environment that points
   at a single configuration file from any command other than "git config"
   quite a while ago, but "git clone" internally set, exported, and
   then unexported the variable during its operation unnecessarily.

 * "git reset" internals has been reworked and should be faster in
   general. We tried to be careful not to break any behaviour but
   there could be corner cases, especially when running the command
   from a conflicted state, that we may have missed.

 * The implementation of "imap-send" has been updated to reuse xml
   quoting code from http-push codepath, and lost a lot of unused
   code.

 * There is a simple-minded checker for the test scripts in t/
   directory to catch most common mistakes (it is not enabled by
   default).

 * You can build with USE_WILDMATCH=YesPlease to use a replacement
   implementation of pattern matching logic used for pathname-like
   things, e.g. refnames and paths in the repository.  This new
   implementation is not expected change the existing behaviour of Git
   in this release, except for "git for-each-ref" where you can now
   say "refs/**/master" and match with both refs/heads/master and
   refs/remotes/origin/master.  We plan to use this new implementation
   in wider places (e.g. "git ls-files '**/Makefile' may find Makefile
   at the top-level, and "git log '**/t*.sh'" may find commits that
   touch a shell script whose name begins with "t" at any level) in
   future versions of Git, but we are not there yet.  By building with
   USE_WILDMATCH, using the resulting Git daily and reporting when you
   find breakages, you can help us get closer to that goal.

 * Some reimplementations of Git do not write all the stat info back
   to the index due to their implementation limitations (e.g. jgit).
   A configuration option can tell Git to ignore changes to most of
   the stat fields and only pay attention to mtime and size, which
   these implementations can reliably update.  This can be used to
   avoid excessive revalidation of contents.

 * Some platforms ship with old version of expat where xmlparse.h
   needs to be included instead of expat.h; the build procedure has
   been taught about this.

 * "make clean" on platforms that cannot compute header dependencies
   on the fly did not work with implementations of "rm" that do not
   like an empty argument list.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.1
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.1 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * An element on GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list that does not name the
   real path to a directory (i.e. a symbolic link) could have caused
   the GIT_DIR discovery logic to escape the ceiling.

 * When attempting to read the XDG-style $HOME/.config/git/config and
   finding that $HOME/.config/git is a file, we gave a wrong error
   message, instead of treating the case as "a custom config file does
   not exist there" and moving on.

 * The behaviour visible to the end users was confusing, when they
   attempt to kill a process spawned in the editor that was in turn
   launched by Git with SIGINT (or SIGQUIT), as Git would catch that
   signal and die.  We ignore these signals now.
   (merge 0398fc34 pf/editor-ignore-sigint later to maint).

 * A child process that was killed by a signal (e.g. SIGINT) was
   reported in an inconsistent way depending on how the process was
   spawned by us, with or without a shell in between.

 * After failing to create a temporary file using mkstemp(), failing
   pathname was not reported correctly on some platforms.

 * We used to stuff "user@" and then append what we read from
   /etc/mailname to come up with a default e-mail ident, but a bug
   lost the "user@" part.

 * The attribute mechanism didn't allow limiting attributes to be
   applied to only a single directory itself with "path/" like the
   exclude mechanism does.  The initial implementation of this that
   was merged to 'maint' and 1.8.1.2 was with a severe performance
   degradations and needs to merge a fix-up topic.

 * The smart HTTP clients forgot to verify the content-type that comes
   back from the server side to make sure that the request is being
   handled properly.

 * "git am" did not parse datestamp correctly from Hg generated patch,
   when it is run in a locale outside C (or en).

 * "git apply" misbehaved when fixing whitespace breakages by removing
   excess trailing blank lines.

 * "git apply --summary" has been taught to make sure the similarity
   value shown in its output is sensible, even when the input had a
   bogus value.

 * A tar archive created by "git archive" recorded a directory in a
   way that made NetBSD's implementation of "tar" sometimes unhappy.

 * "git archive" did not record uncompressed size in the header when
   streaming a zip archive, which confused some implementations of unzip.

 * "git archive" did not parse configuration values in tar.* namespace
   correctly.
   (merge b3873c3 jk/config-parsing-cleanup later to maint).

 * Attempt to "branch --edit-description" an existing branch, while
   being on a detached HEAD, errored out.

 * "git clean" showed what it was going to do, but sometimes end up
   finding that it was not allowed to do so, which resulted in a
   confusing output (e.g. after saying that it will remove an
   untracked directory, it found an embedded git repository there
   which it is not allowed to remove).  It now performs the actions
   and then reports the outcome more faithfully.

 * When "git clone --separate-git-dir=$over_there" is interrupted, it
   failed to remove the real location of the $GIT_DIR it created.
   This was most visible when interrupting a submodule update.

 * "git cvsimport" mishandled timestamps at DST boundary.

 * We used to have an arbitrary 32 limit for combined diff input,
   resulting in incorrect number of leading colons shown when showing
   the "--raw --cc" output.

 * "git fetch --depth" was broken in at least three ways.  The
   resulting history was deeper than specified by one commit, it was
   unclear how to wipe the shallowness of the repository with the
   command, and documentation was misleading.
   (merge cfb70e1 nd/fetch-depth-is-broken later to maint).

 * "git log --all -p" that walked refs/notes/textconv/ ref can later
   try to use the textconv data incorrectly after it gets freed.

 * We forgot to close the file descriptor reading from "gpg" output,
   killing "git log --show-signature" on a long history.

 * The way "git svn" asked for password using SSH_ASKPASS and
   GIT_ASKPASS was not in line with the rest of the system.

 * The --graph code fell into infinite loop when asked to do what the
   code did not expect.

 * http transport was wrong to ask for the username when the
   authentication is done by certificate identity.

 * "git pack-refs" that ran in parallel to another process that
   created new refs had a nasty race.

 * Rebasing the history of superproject with change in the submodule
   has been broken since v1.7.12.

 * After "git add -N" and then writing a tree object out of the
   index, the cache-tree data structure got corrupted.

 * "git clone" used to allow --bare and --separate-git-dir=$there
   options at the same time, which was nonsensical.

 * "git rebase --preserve-merges" lost empty merges in recent versions
   of Git.

 * "git merge --no-edit" computed who were involved in the work done
   on the side branch, even though that information is to be discarded
   without getting seen in the editor.

 * "git merge" started calling prepare-commit-msg hook like "git
   commit" does some time ago, but forgot to pay attention to the exit
   status of the hook.

 * A failure to push due to non-ff while on an unborn branch
   dereferenced a NULL pointer when showing an error message.

 * When users spell "cc:" in lowercase in the fake "header" in the
   trailer part, "git send-email" failed to pick up the addresses from
   there. As e-mail headers field names are case insensitive, this
   script should follow suit and treat "cc:" and "Cc:" the same way.

 * Output from "git status --ignored" showed an unexpected interaction
   with "--untracked".

 * "gitweb", when sorting by age to show repositories with new
   activities first, used to sort repositories with absolutely
   nothing in it early, which was not very useful.

 * "gitweb"'s code to sanitize control characters before passing it to
   "highlight" filter lost known-to-be-safe control characters by
   mistake.

 * "gitweb" pages served over HTTPS, when configured to show picon or
   gravatar, referred to these external resources to be fetched via
   HTTP, resulting in mixed contents warning in browsers.

 * When a line to be wrapped has a solid run of non space characters
   whose length exactly is the wrap width, "git shortlog -w" failed
   to add a newline after such a line.

 * Command line completion leaked an unnecessary error message while
   looking for possible matches with paths in <tree-ish>.

 * Command line completion for "tcsh" emitted an unwanted space
   after completing a single directory name.

 * Command line completion code was inadvertently made incompatible with
   older versions of bash by using a newer array notation.

 * "git push" was taught to refuse updating the branch that is
   currently checked out long time ago, but the user manual was left
   stale.
   (merge 50995ed wk/man-deny-current-branch-is-default-these-days later to maint).

 * Some shells do not behave correctly when IFS is unset; work it
   around by explicitly setting it to the default value.

 * Some scripted programs written in Python did not get updated when
   PYTHON_PATH changed.
   (cherry-pick 96a4647fca54031974cd6ad1 later to maint).

 * When autoconf is used, any build on a different commit always ran
   "config.status --recheck" even when unnecessary.

 * A fix was added to the build procedure to work around buggy
   versions of ccache broke the auto-generation of dependencies, which
   unfortunately is still relevant because some people use ancient
   distros.

 * The autoconf subsystem passed --mandir down to generated
   config.mak.autogen but forgot to do the same for --htmldir.
   (merge 55d9bf0 ct/autoconf-htmldir later to maint).

 * A change made on v1.8.1.x maintenance track had a nasty regression
   to break the build when autoconf is used.
   (merge 7f1b697 jn/less-reconfigure later to maint).

 * We have been carrying a translated and long-unmaintained copy of an
   old version of the tutorial; removed.

 * t0050 had tests expecting failures from a bug that was fixed some
   time ago.

 * t4014, t9502 and t0200 tests had various portability issues that
   broke on OpenBSD.

 * t9020 and t3600 tests had various portability issues.

 * t9200 runs "cvs init" on a directory that already exists, but a
   platform can configure this fail for the current user (e.g. you
   need to be in the cvsadmin group on NetBSD 6.0).

 * t9020 and t9810 had a few non-portable shell script construct.

 * Scripts to test bash completion was inherently flaky as it was
   affected by whatever random things the user may have on $PATH.

 * An element on GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES could be a "logical" pathname
   that uses a symbolic link to point at somewhere else (e.g. /home/me
   that points at /net/host/export/home/me, and the latter directory
   is automounted). Earlier when Git saw such a pathname e.g. /home/me
   on this environment variable, the "ceiling" mechanism did not take
   effect. With this release (the fix has also been merged to the
   v1.8.1.x maintenance series), elements on GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
   are by default checked for such aliasing coming from symbolic
   links. As this needs to actually resolve symbolic links for each
   element on the GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, you can disable this
   mechanism for some elements by listing them after an empty element
   on the GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES. e.g. Setting /home/me::/home/him to
   GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES makes Git resolve symbolic links in
   /home/me when checking if the current directory is under /home/me,
   but does not do so for /home/him.
   (merge 7ec30aa mh/maint-ceil-absolute later to maint).

========================

Fixes since v1.8.3
------------------

 * When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
   used to complain and die. The check has been loosened.

 * Handling of negative exclude pattern for directories "!dir" was
   broken in the update to v1.8.3.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.3.1
--------------------

 * Cloning with "git clone --depth N" while fetch.fsckobjects (or
   transfer.fsckobjects) is set to true did not tell the cut-off
   points of the shallow history to the process that validates the
   objects and the history received, causing the validation to fail.

 * "git checkout foo" DWIMs the intended "upstream" and turns it into
   "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo". This codepath has been
   updated to correctly take existing remote definitions into account.

 * "git fetch" into a shallow repository from a repository that does
   not know about the shallow boundary commits (e.g. a different fork
   from the repository the current shallow repository was cloned from)
   did not work correctly.

 * "git subtree" (in contrib/) had one codepath with loose error
   checks to lose data at the remote side.

 * "git log --ancestry-path A...B" did not work as expected, as it did
   not pay attention to the fact that the merge base between A and B
   was the bottom of the range being specified.

 * "git diff -c -p" was not showing a deleted line from a hunk when
   another hunk immediately begins where the earlier one ends.

 * "git merge @{-1}~22" was rewritten to "git merge frotz@{1}~22"
   incorrectly when your previous branch was "frotz" (it should be
   rewritten to "git merge frotz~22" instead).

 * "git commit --allow-empty-message -m ''" should not start an
   editor.

 * "git push --[no-]verify" was not documented.

 * An entry for "file://" scheme in the enumeration of URL types Git
   can take in the HTML documentation was made into a clickable link
   by mistake.

 * zsh prompt script that borrowed from bash prompt script did not
   work due to slight differences in array variable notation between
   these two shells.

 * The bash prompt code (in contrib/) displayed the name of the branch
   being rebased when "rebase -i/-m/-p" modes are in use, but not the
   plain vanilla "rebase".

 * "git push $there HEAD:branch" did not resolve HEAD early enough, so
   it was easy to flip it around while push is still going on and push
   out a branch that the user did not originally intended when the
   command was started.

 * "difftool --dir-diff" did not copy back changes made by the

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.3.2
--------------------

 * "git apply" parsed patches that add new files, generated by programs
   other than Git, incorrectly.  This is an old breakage in v1.7.11.

 * Older cURL wanted piece of memory we call it with to be stable, but
   we updated the auth material after handing it to a call.

 * "git pull" into nothing trashed "local changes" that were in the
   index.

 * Many "git submodule" operations did not work on a submodule at a
   path whose name is not in ASCII.

 * "cherry-pick" had a small leak in its error codepath.

 * Logic used by git-send-email to suppress cc mishandled names like
   "A U. Thor" <author@example.xz>, where the human readable part
   needs to be quoted (the user input may not have the double quotes
   around the name, and comparison was done between quoted and
   unquoted strings).  It also mishandled names that need RFC2047
   quoting.

 * "gitweb" forgot to clear a global variable $search_regexp upon each
   request, mistakenly carrying over the previous search to a new one
   when used as a persistent CGI.

 * The wildmatch engine did not honor WM_CASEFOLD option correctly.

 * "git log -c --follow $path" segfaulted upon hitting the commit that
   renamed the $path being followed.

 * When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch",
   e.g. "git log @{u}", we did not say which branch and worse said
   "branch ''" in the error messages.

 * Mac OS X does not like to write(2) more than INT_MAX number of
   bytes; work it around by chopping write(2) into smaller pieces.

 * Newer MacOS X encourages the programs to compile and link with
   their CommonCrypto, not with OpenSSL.

Also contains various minor documentation updates.

==========================

This update is mostly to propagate documentation fixes and test
updates from the master front back to the maintenance track.

Fixes since v1.8.3.3
--------------------

 * The bisect log listed incorrect commits when bisection ends with
   only skipped ones.

 * The test coverage framework was left broken for some time.

 * The test suite for HTTP transport did not run with Apache 2.4.

 * "git diff" used to fail when core.safecrlf is set and the working
   tree contents had mixed CRLF/LF line endings. Committing such a
   content must be prohibited, but "git diff" should help the user to
   locate and fix such problems without failing.

========================

Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0)
------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics that pushes only the current branch to the branch with the same
name, and only when the current branch is set to integrate with that
remote branch.  Use the user preference configuration variable
"push.default" to change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used
to the "matching" semantics, you can set the variable to "matching"
to keep the traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future
early, you can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" (and "git add -A") is run inside a subdirectory and
does not specify which paths to add on the command line, it
will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands.  There will be no
mechanism to make plain "git add -u" behave like "git add -u .".
Current users of "git add -u" (without a pathspec) should start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ."
before Git 2.0 comes.  A warning is issued when these commands are
run without a pathspec and when you have local changes outside the
current directory, because the behaviour in Git 2.0 will be different
from today's version in such a situation.

In Git 2.0, "git add <path>" will behave as "git add -A <path>", so
that "git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory
and record the removal.  Versions before Git 2.0, including this
release, will keep ignoring removals, but the users who rely on this
behaviour are encouraged to start using "git add --ignore-removal <path>"
now before 2.0 is released.


Updates since v1.8.2
--------------------

Foreign interface

 * remote-hg and remote-bzr helpers (in contrib/ since v1.8.2) have
   been updated; especially, the latter has been done in an
   accelerated schedule (read: we may not have merged to this release
   if we were following the usual "cook sufficiently in next before
   unleashing it to the world" workflow) in order to help Emacs folks,
   whose primary SCM seems to be stagnating.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * A handful of updates applied to gitk, including an addition of
   "revert" action, showing dates in tags in a nicer way, making
   colors configurable, and support for -G'pickaxe' search.

 * The prompt string generator (in contrib/completion/) learned to
   show how many changes there are in total and how many have been
   replayed during a "git rebase" session.

 * "git branch --vv" learned to paint the name of the branch it
   integrates with in a different color (color.branch.upstream,
   which defaults to blue).

 * In a sparsely populated working tree, "git checkout <pathspec>" no
   longer unmarks paths that match the given pathspec that were
   originally ignored with "--sparse" (use --ignore-skip-worktree-bits
   option to resurrect these paths out of the index if you really want
   to).

 * "git log --format" specifier learned %C(auto) token that tells Git
   to use color when interpolating %d (decoration), %h (short commit
   object name), etc. for terminal output.

 * "git bisect" leaves the final outcome as a comment in its bisect
   log file.

 * "git clone --reference" can now refer to a gitfile "textual symlink"
   that points at the real location of the repository.

 * "git count-objects" learned "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to
   show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.

 * "git cherry-pick $blob" and "git cherry-pick $tree" are nonsense,
   and a more readable error message e.g. "can't cherry-pick a tree"
   is given (we used to say "expected exactly one commit").

 * The "--annotate" option to "git send-email" can be turned on (or
   off) by default with sendemail.annotate configuration variable (you
   can use --no-annotate from the command line to override it).

 * The "--cover-letter" option to "git format-patch" can be turned on
   (or off) by default with format.coverLetter configuration
   variable. By setting it to 'auto', you can turn it on only for a
   series with two or more patches.

 * The bash completion support (in contrib/) learned that cherry-pick
   takes a few more options than it already knew about.

 * "git help" learned "-g" option to show the list of guides just like
   list of commands are given with "-a".

 * A triangular "pull from one place, push to another place" workflow
   is supported better by new remote.pushdefault (overrides the
   "origin" thing) and branch.*.pushremote (overrides the
   branch.*.remote) configuration variables.

 * "git status" learned to report that you are in the middle of a
   revert session, just like it does for a cherry-pick and a bisect
   session.

 * The handling by "git branch --set-upstream-to" against various forms
   of erroneous inputs was suboptimal and has been improved.

 * When the interactive access to git-shell is not enabled, it issues
   a message meant to help the system administrator to enable it.  An
   explicit way has been added to issue custom messages to refuse an
   access over the network to help the end users who connect to the
   service expecting an interactive shell.

 * In addition to the case where the user edits the log message with
   the "e)dit" option of "am -i", replace the "Applying: this patch"
   message with the final log message contents after applymsg hook
   munges it.

 * "git status" suggests users to look into using --untracked=no option
   when it takes too long.

 * "git status" shows a bit more information during a rebase/bisect
   session.

 * "git fetch" learned to fetch a commit at the tip of an unadvertised
   ref by specifying a raw object name from the command line when the
   server side supports this feature.

 * Output from "git log --graph" works better with submodule log
   output now.

 * "git count-objects -v" learned to report leftover temporary
   packfiles and other garbage in the object store.

 * A new read-only credential helper (in contrib/) to interact with
   the .netrc/.authinfo files has been added.

 * "git send-email" can be used with the credential helper system.

 * There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
   this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
   "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 * "git pull --rebase" learned to pass "-v/-q" options to underlying
   "git rebase".

 * The new "--follow-tags" option tells "git push" to push relevant
   annotated tags when pushing branches out.

 * "git merge" and "git pull" can optionally be told to inspect and
   reject when merging a commit that does not carry a trusted GPG
   signature.

 * "git mergetool" now feeds files to the "p4merge" backend in the
   order that matches the p4 convention, where "theirs" is usually
   shown on the left side, which is the opposite from what other backends
   expect.

 * "show/log" now honors gpg.program configuration just like other
   parts of the code that use GnuPG.

 * "git log" that shows the difference between the parent and the
   child has been optimized somewhat.

 * "git difftool" allows the user to write into the temporary files
   being shown; if the user makes changes to the working tree at the
   same time, it now refrains from overwriting the copy in the working
   tree and leaves the temporary file so that changes can be merged
   manually.

 * There was no good way to ask "I have a random string that came from
   outside world. I want to turn it into a 40-hex object name while
   making sure such an object exists".  A new peeling suffix ^{object}
   can be used for that purpose, together with "rev-parse --verify".


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * Updates for building under msvc.

 * A handful of issues in the code that traverses the working tree to find
   untracked and/or ignored files have been fixed, and the general
   codepath involved in "status -u" and "clean" have been cleaned up
   and optimized.

 * The stack footprint of some codepaths that access an object from a
   pack has been shrunk.

 * The logic to coalesce the same lines removed from the parents in
   the output from "diff -c/--cc" has been updated, but with O(n^2)
   complexity, so this might turn out to be undesirable.

 * The code to enforce permission bits on files in $GIT_DIR/ for
   shared repositories has been simplified.

 * A few codepaths know how much data they need to put in the
   hashtables they use when they start, but still began with small tables
   and repeatedly grew and rehashed them.

 * The API to walk reflog entries from the latest to older, which was
   necessary for operations such as "git checkout -", was cumbersome
   to use correctly and also inefficient.

 * Codepaths that inspect log-message-to-be and decide when to add a
   new Signed-off-by line in various commands have been consolidated.

 * The pkt-line API, implementation and its callers have been cleaned
   up to make them more robust.

 * The Cygwin port has a faster-but-lying lstat(2) emulation whose
   incorrectness does not matter in practice except for a few
   codepaths, and setting permission bits on directories is a codepath
   that needs to use a more correct one.

 * "git checkout" had repeated pathspec matches on the same paths,
   which have been consolidated.  Also a bug in "git checkout dir/"
   that is started from an unmerged index has been fixed.

 * A few bugfixes to "git rerere" working on corner case merge
   conflicts have been applied.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.2
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.2 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * Recent versions of File::Temp (used by "git svn") started blowing
   up when its tempfile sub is called as a class method; updated the
   callsite to call it as a plain vanilla function to fix it.
   (merge eafc2dd hb/git-pm-tempfile later to maint).

 * Various subcommands of "git remote" simply ignored extraneous
   command line arguments instead of diagnosing them as errors.

 * When receive-pack detects an error in the pack header it received in
   order to decide which of unpack-objects or index-pack to run, it
   returned without closing the error stream, which led to a hung
   sideband thread.

 * Zsh completion forgot that the '%' character used to signal untracked
   files needs to be escaped with another '%'.

 * A commit object whose author or committer ident are malformed
   crashed some code that trusted that a name, an email and a
   timestamp can always be found in it.

 * When "upload-pack" fails while generating a pack in response to
   "git fetch" (or "git clone"), the receiving side had
   a programming error that triggered the die handler
   recursively.

 * "rev-list --stdin" and friends kept bogus pointers into the input
   buffer around as human readable object names.  This was not a huge
   problem but was exposed by a new change that uses these names in
   error output.

 * Smart-capable HTTP servers were not restricted via the
   GIT_NAMESPACE mechanism when talking with commit-walking clients,
   like they are when talking with smart HTTP clients.
   (merge 6130f86 jk/http-dumb-namespaces later to maint).

 * "git merge-tree" did not omit a merge result that is identical to
   the "our" side in certain cases.
   (merge aacecc3 jk/merge-tree-added-identically later to maint).

 * Perl scripts like "git-svn" closed (instead of redirecting to /dev/null)
   the standard error stream, which is not a very smart thing to do.
   A later open may return file descriptor #2 for an unrelated purpose, and
   error reporting code may write into it.

 * "git show-branch" was not prepared to show a very long run of
   ancestor operators e.g. foobar^2~2^2^2^2...^2~4 correctly.

 * "git diff --diff-algorithm algo" is also understood as "git diff
   --diff-algorithm=algo".

 * The new core.commentchar configuration was not applied in a few
   places.

 * "git bundle" erroneously bailed out when parsing a valid bundle
   containing a prerequisite commit without a commit message.

 * "git log -S/-G" started paying attention to textconv filter, but
   there was no way to disable this.  Make it honor the --no-textconv
   option.

 * When used with the "-d temporary-directory" option, "git filter-branch"
   failed to come back to the original working tree to perform the
   final clean-up procedure.

 * "git merge $(git rev-parse v1.8.2)" behaved quite differently from
   "git merge v1.8.2", as if v1.8.2 were written as v1.8.2^0 and did
   not pay much attention to the annotated tag payload.  Make the code
   notice the type of the tag object, in addition to the dwim_ref()
   based classification the current code uses (i.e. the name appears
   in refs/tags/) to decide when to special-case tag merging.

 * Fix a 1.8.1.x regression that stopped matching "dir" (without a
   trailing slash) to a directory "dir".

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" was not prepared to see a line getting
   longer after fixing whitespaces (e.g. tab-in-indent aka Python).

 * The prompt string generator (in contrib/completion/) did not notice
   when we are in a middle of a "git revert" session.

 * "submodule summary --summary-limit" option did not support the
   "--option=value" form.

 * "index-pack --fix-thin" used an uninitialized value to compute
   the delta depths of objects it appends to the resulting pack.

 * "index-pack --verify-stat" used a few counters outside the protection
   of a mutex, possibly showing incorrect numbers.

 * The code to keep track of what directory names are known to Git on
   platforms with case insensitive filesystems could get confused upon a
   hash collision between these pathnames and would loop forever.

 * Annotated tags outside the refs/tags/ hierarchy were not advertised
   correctly to ls-remote and fetch with recent versions of Git.

 * Recent optimizations broke shallow clones.

 * "git cmd -- ':(top'" was not diagnosed as an invalid syntax, and
   instead the parser kept reading beyond the end of the string.

 * "git tag -f <tag>" always said "Updated tag '<tag>'" even when
   creating a new tag (i.e. neither overwriting nor updating).

 * "git p4" did not behave well when the path to the root of the P4
   client was not its real path.
   (merge bbd8486 pw/p4-symlinked-root later to maint).

 * "git archive" reported a failure when asked to create an archive out
   of an empty tree.  It is more intuitive to give an empty
   archive back in such a case.

 * When "format-patch" quoted a non-ascii string in header files,
   it incorrectly applied rfc2047 and chopped a single character in
   the middle of the string.

 * An aliased command spawned from a bare repository that does not say
   it is bare with "core.bare = yes" was treated as non-bare by mistake.

 * In "git reflog expire", the REACHABLE bit was not cleared from the
   correct objects.

 * The logic used by "git diff -M --stat" to shorten the names of
   files before and after a rename did not work correctly when the
   common prefix and suffix between the two filenames overlapped.

 * The "--match=<pattern>" option of "git describe", when used with
   "--all" to allow refs that are not annotated tags to be a
   base of description, did not restrict the output from the command
   to those refs that match the given pattern.

 * Clarify in the documentation "what" gets pushed to "where" when the
   command line to "git push" does not say these explicitly.

 * The "--color=<when>" argument to the commands in the diff family
   was described poorly.

 * The arguments given to the pre-rebase hook were not documented.

 * The v4 index format was not documented.

 * The "--match=<pattern>" argument "git describe" takes uses glob
   pattern but it wasn't obvious from the documentation.

 * Some sources failed to compile on systems that lack NI_MAXHOST in
   their system header (e.g. z/OS).

 * Add an example use of "--env-filter" in "filter-branch"
   documentation.

 * "git bundle verify" did not say "records a complete history" for a
   bundle that does not have any prerequisites.

 * In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
   to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
   CGit sideways, bypassing the entry points of the API the
   in-tree users use.

 * "git update-index -h" did not do the usual "-h(elp)" thing.

 * "git index-pack" had a buffer-overflow while preparing an
   informational message when the translated version of it was too
   long.

 * 'git commit -m "$msg"' used to add an extra newline even when
   $msg already ended with one.

 * The SSL peer verification done by "git imap-send" did not ask for
   Server Name Indication (RFC 4366), failing to connect to SSL/TLS
   sites that serve multiple hostnames on a single IP.

 * perl/Git.pm::cat_blob slurped everything in core only to write it
   out to a file descriptor, which was not a very smart thing to do.

 * "git branch" did not bother to check nonsense command line
   parameters.  It now issues errors in many cases.

 * Verification of signed tags was not done correctly when not in C
   or en/US locale.

 * Some platforms and users spell UTF-8 differently; retry with the
   most official "UTF-8" when the system does not understand the
   user-supplied encoding name that is a common alternative
   spelling of UTF-8.

 * When export-subst is used, "zip" output recorded an incorrect
   size of the file.

 * "git am $maildir/" applied messages in an unexpected order; sort
   filenames read from the maildir/ in a way that is more likely to
   sort the messages in the order the writing MUA meant to, by sorting
   numeric segments in numeric order and non-numeric segments in
   alphabetical order.

========================

Fixes since v1.8.4
------------------

 * Some old versions of bash do not grok some constructs like
   'printf -v varname' which the prompt and completion code started
   to use recently.  The completion and prompt scripts have been
   adjusted to work better with these old versions of bash.

 * In FreeBSD's and NetBSD's "sh", a return in a dot script in a
   function returns from the function, not only in the dot script,
   breaking "git rebase" on these platforms (regression introduced
   in 1.8.4-rc1).

 * "git rebase -i" and other scripted commands were feeding a
   random, data dependant error message to 'echo' and expecting it
   to come out literally.

 * Setting the "submodule.<name>.path" variable to the empty
   "true" caused the configuration parser to segfault.

 * Output from "git log --full-diff -- <pathspec>" looked strange
   because comparison was done with the previous ancestor that
   touched the specified <pathspec>, causing the patches for paths
   outside the pathspec to show more than the single commit has
   changed.

 * The auto-tag-following code in "git fetch" tries to reuse the
   same transport twice when the serving end does not cooperate and
   does not give tags that point to commits that are asked for as
   part of the primary transfer.  Unfortunately, Git-aware transport
   helper interface is not designed to be used more than once, hence
   this did not work over smart-http transfer.  Fixed.

 * Send a large request to read(2)/write(2) as a smaller but still
   reasonably large chunks, which would improve the latency when the
   operation needs to be killed and incidentally works around broken
   64-bit systems that cannot take a 2GB write or read in one go.

 * A ".mailmap" file that ends with an incomplete line, when read
   from a blob, was not handled properly.

 * The recent "short-cut clone connectivity check" topic broke a
   shallow repository when a fetch operation tries to auto-follow
   tags.

 * When send-email comes up with an error message to die with upon
   failure to start an SSL session, it tried to read the error
   string from a wrong place.

 * A call to xread() was used without a loop to cope with short
   read in the codepath to stream large blobs to a pack.

 * On platforms with fgetc() and friends defined as macros, the
   configuration parser did not compile.

 * New versions of MediaWiki introduced a new API for returning
   more than 500 results in response to a query, which would cause
   the MediaWiki remote helper to go into an infinite loop.

 * Subversion's serf access method (the only one available in
   Subversion 1.8) for http and https URLs in skelta mode tells its
   caller to open multiple files at a time, which made "git svn
   fetch" complain that "Temp file with moniker 'svn_delta' already
   in use" instead of fetching.


Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.

========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.1
--------------------

 * "git clone" gave some progress messages to the standard output, not
   to the standard error, and did not allow suppressing them with the
   "--no-progress" option.

 * "format-patch --from=<whom>" forgot to omit unnecessary in-body
   from line, i.e. when <whom> is the same as the real author.

 * "git shortlog" used to choke and die when there is a malformed
   commit (e.g. missing authors); it now simply ignore such a commit
   and keeps going.

 * "git merge-recursive" did not parse its "--diff-algorithm=" command
   line option correctly.

 * "git branch --track" had a minor regression in v1.8.3.2 and later
   that made it impossible to base your local work on anything but a
   local branch of the upstream repository you are tracking from.

 * "git ls-files -k" needs to crawl only the part of the working tree
   that may overlap the paths in the index to find killed files, but
   shared code with the logic to find all the untracked files, which
   made it unnecessarily inefficient.

 * When there is no sufficient overlap between old and new history
   during a "git fetch" into a shallow repository, objects that the
   sending side knows the receiving end has were unnecessarily sent.

 * When running "fetch -q", a long silence while the sender side
   computes the set of objects to send can be mistaken by proxies as
   dropped connection.  The server side has been taught to send a
   small empty messages to keep the connection alive.

 * When the webserver responds with "405 Method Not Allowed", "git
   http-backend" should tell the client what methods are allowed with
   the "Allow" header.

 * "git cvsserver" computed the permission mode bits incorrectly for
   executable files.

 * The implementation of "add -i" has a crippling code to work around
   ActiveState Perl limitation but it by mistake also triggered on Git
   for Windows where MSYS perl is used.

 * We made sure that we notice the user-supplied GIT_DIR is actually a
   gitfile, but did not do the same when the default ".git" is a
   gitfile.

 * When an object is not found after checking the packfiles and then
   loose object directory, read_sha1_file() re-checks the packfiles to
   prevent racing with a concurrent repacker; teach the same logic to
   has_sha1_file().

 * "git commit --author=$name", when $name is not in the canonical
   "A. U. Thor <au.thor@example.xz>" format, looks for a matching name
   from existing history, but did not consult mailmap to grab the
   preferred author name.

 * The commit object names in the insn sheet that was prepared at the
   beginning of "rebase -i" session can become ambiguous as the
   rebasing progresses and the repository gains more commits. Make
   sure the internal record is kept with full 40-hex object names.

 * "git rebase --preserve-merges" internally used the merge machinery
   and as a side effect, left merge summary message in the log, but
   when rebasing, there should not be a need for merge summary.

 * "git rebase -i" forgot that the comment character can be
   configurable while reading its insn sheet.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.

========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.2
--------------------

 * The interaction between use of Perl in our test suite and NO_PERL
   has been clarified a bit.

 * A fast-import stream expresses a pathname with funny characters by
   quoting them in C style; remote-hg remote helper (in contrib/)
   forgot to unquote such a path.

 * One long-standing flaw in the pack transfer protocol used by "git
   clone" was that there was no way to tell the other end which branch
   "HEAD" points at, and the receiving end needed to guess.  A new
   capability has been defined in the pack protocol to convey this
   information so that cloning from a repository with more than one
   branches pointing at the same commit where the HEAD is at now
   reliably sets the initial branch in the resulting repository.

 * We did not handle cases where http transport gets redirected during
   the authorization request (e.g. from http:// to https://).

 * "git rev-list --objects ^v1.0^ v1.0" gave v1.0 tag itself in the
   output, but "git rev-list --objects v1.0^..v1.0" did not.

 * The fall-back parsing of commit objects with broken author or
   committer lines were less robust than ideal in picking up the
   timestamps.

 * Bash prompting code to deal with an SVN remote as an upstream
   were coded in a way not supported by older Bash versions (3.x).

 * "git checkout topic", when there is not yet a local "topic" branch
   but there is a unique remote-tracking branch for a remote "topic"
   branch, pretended as if "git checkout -t -b topic remote/$r/topic"
   (for that unique remote $r) was run. This hack however was not
   implemented for "git checkout topic --".

 * Coloring around octopus merges in "log --graph" output was screwy.

 * We did not generate HTML version of documentation to "git subtree"
   in contrib/.

 * The synopsis section of "git unpack-objects" documentation has been
   clarified a bit.

 * An ancient How-To on serving Git repositories on an HTTP server
   lacked a warning that it has been mostly superseded with more
   modern way.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.

========================

Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0)
------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics that pushes:

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, and only
   when the current branch is set to integrate with that remote
   branch, if you are pushing to the same remote as you fetch from; or

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, if you
   are pushing to a remote that is not where you usually fetch from.

Use the user preference configuration variable "push.default" to
change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used to the "matching"
semantics, you can set the variable to "matching" to keep the
traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future early, you
can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" (and "git add -A") is run inside a subdirectory and
does not specify which paths to add on the command line, it
will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands.  There will be no
mechanism to make plain "git add -u" behave like "git add -u .".
Current users of "git add -u" (without a pathspec) should start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ."
before Git 2.0 comes.  A warning is issued when these commands are
run without a pathspec and when you have local changes outside the
current directory, because the behaviour in Git 2.0 will be different
from today's version in such a situation.

In Git 2.0, "git add <path>" will behave as "git add -A <path>", so
that "git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory
and record the removal.  Versions before Git 2.0, including this
release, will keep ignoring removals, but the users who rely on this
behaviour are encouraged to start using "git add --ignore-removal <path>"
now before 2.0 is released.


Updates since v1.8.3
--------------------

Foreign interfaces, subsystems and ports.

 * Cygwin port has been updated for more recent Cygwin 1.7.

 * "git rebase -i" now honors --strategy and -X options.

 * Git-gui has been updated to its 0.18.0 version.

 * MediaWiki remote helper (in contrib/) has been updated to use the
   credential helper interface from Git.pm.

 * Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  Torsten Bgershausen reports that
   this is fine with Cygwin 1.7 ($gmane/225824) so let's try moving it
   ahead.

 * The credential helper to talk to keychain on OS X (in contrib/) has
   been updated to kick in not just when talking http/https but also
   imap(s) and smtp.

 * Remote transport helper has been updated to report errors and
   maintain ref hierarchy used to keep track of its own state better.

 * With "export" remote-helper protocol, (1) a push that tries to
   update a remote ref whose name is different from the pushing side
   does not work yet, and (2) the helper may not know how to do
   --dry-run; these problematic cases are disabled for now.

 * git-remote-hg/bzr (in contrib/) updates.

 * git-remote-mw (in contrib/) hints users to check the certificate,
   when https:// connection failed.

 * git-remote-mw (in contrib/) adds a command to allow previewing the
   contents locally before pushing it out, when working with a
   MediaWiki remote.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * Sample "post-receive-email" hook script got an enhanced replacement
   "multimail" (in contrib/).

 * Also in contrib/ is a new "contacts" script that runs "git blame"
   to find out the people who may be interested in a set of changes.

 * "git clean" command learned an interactive mode.

 * The "--head" option to "git show-ref" was only to add "HEAD" to the
   list of candidate refs to be filtered by the usual rules
   (e.g. "--heads" that only show refs under refs/heads).  The meaning
   of the option has been changed to always show "HEAD" regardless of
   what filtering will be applied to any other ref.

   This is a backward incompatible change and might cause breakages to
   people's existing scripts.

 * "git show -s" was less discoverable than it should have been.  It
   now has a natural synonym "git show --no-patch".

 * "git check-mailmap" is a new command that lets you map usernames
   and e-mail addresses through the mailmap mechanism, just like many
   built-in commands do.

 * "git name-rev" learned to name an annotated tag object back to its
   tagname; "git name-rev $(git rev-parse v1.0.0)" gives "tags/v1.0.0",
   for example.

 * "git cat-file --batch-check=<format>" is added, primarily to allow
   on-disk footprint of objects in packfiles (often they are a lot
   smaller than their true size, when expressed as deltas) to be
   reported.

 * "git rebase [-i]" used to leave just "rebase" as its reflog messages
   for some operations. They have been reworded to be more informative.

 * In addition to the choice from "rebase, merge, or checkout-detach",
   "submodule update" can allow a custom command to be used in to
   update the working tree of submodules via the "submodule.*.update"
   configuration variable.

 * "git submodule update" can optionally clone the submodule
   repositories shallowly.

 * "git format-patch" learned "--from[=whom]" option, which sets the
   "From: " header to the specified person (or the person who runs the
   command, if "=whom" part is missing) and move the original author
   information to an in-body From: header as necessary.

 * The configuration variable "merge.ff" was cleary a tri-state to
   choose one from "favor fast-forward when possible", "always create
   a merge even when the history could fast-forward" and "do not
   create any merge, only update when the history fast-forwards", but
   the command line parser did not implement the usual convention of
   "last one wins, and command line overrides the configuration"
   correctly.

 * "gitweb" learned to optionally place extra links that point at the
   levels higher than the Gitweb pages themselves in the breadcrumbs,
   so that it can be used as part of a larger installation.

 * "git log --format=" now honors i18n.logoutputencoding configuration
   variable.

 * The "push.default=simple" mode of "git push" has been updated to
   behave like "current" without requiring a remote tracking
   information, when you push to a remote that is different from where
   you fetch from (i.e. a triangular workflow).

 * Having multiple "fixup!" on a line in the rebase instruction sheet
   did not work very well with "git rebase -i --autosquash".

 * "git log" learned the "--author-date-order" option, with which the
   output is topologically sorted and commits in parallel histories
   are shown intermixed together based on the author timestamp.

 * Various subcommands of "git submodule" refused to run from anywhere
   other than the top of the working tree of the superproject, but
   they have been taught to let you run from a subdirectory.

 * "git diff" learned a mode that ignores hunks whose change consists
   only of additions and removals of blank lines, which is the same as
   "diff -B" (ignore blank lines) of GNU diff.

 * "git rm" gives a single message followed by list of paths to report
   multiple paths that cannot be removed.

 * "git rebase" can be told with ":/look for this string" syntax commits
   to replay the changes onto and where the work to be replayed begins.

 * Many tutorials teach users to set "color.ui" to "auto" as the first
   thing after you set "user.name/email" to introduce yourselves to
   Git.  Now the variable defaults to "auto".

 * On Cygwin, "cygstart" is now recognised as a possible way to start
   a web browser (used in "help -w" and "instaweb" among others).

 * "git status" learned status.branch and status.short configuration
   variables to use --branch and --short options by default (override
   with --no-branch and --no-short options from the command line).

 * "git cmd <name>", when <name> happens to be a 40-hex string,
   directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
   "refs/<some hierarchy>/<name>" exists.  This disambiguation order
   is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
   like we warn when more than one refs/ hierarchies share the same
   name.

 * "git rebase" learned "--[no-]autostash" option to save local
   changes instead of refusing to run (to which people's normal
   response was to stash them and re-run).  This introduced a corner
   case breakage to "git am --abort" but it has been fixed.

 * "check-ignore" (new feature since 1.8.2) has been updated to work
   more like "check-attr" over bidi-pipes.

 * "git describe" learned "--first-parent" option to limit its closest
   tagged commit search to the first-parent chain.

 * "git merge foo" that might have meant "git merge origin/foo" is
   diagnosed with a more informative error message.

 * "git log -L<line>,<range>:<filename>" has been added.  This may
   still have leaks and rough edges, though.

 * We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
   of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
   --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
   "git gc" and "git reflog" have been updated with a new parsing
   function for expiry dates.

 * Updates to completion (both bash and zsh) helpers.

 * The behaviour of the "--chain-reply-to" option of "git send-email"
   have changed at 1.7.0, and we added a warning/advice message to
   help users adjust to the new behaviour back then, but we kept it
   around for too long.  The message has finally been removed.

 * "git fetch origin master" unlike "git fetch origin" or "git fetch"
   did not update "refs/remotes/origin/master"; this was an early
   design decision to keep the update of remote tracking branches
   predictable, but in practice it turns out that people find it more
   convenient to opportunistically update them whenever we have a
   chance, and we have been updating them when we run "git push" which
   already breaks the original "predictability" anyway.

 * The configuration variable core.checkstat was advertised in the
   documentation but the code expected core.statinfo instead.
   For now, we accept both core.checkstat and core.statinfo, but the
   latter will be removed in the longer term.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * On Cygwin, we used to use our own lstat(2) emulation that is
   allegedly faster than the platform one in codepaths where some of
   the information it returns did not matter, but it started to bite
   us in a few codepaths where the trick it uses to cheat does show
   breakages. This emulation has been removed and we use the native
   lstat(2) emulation supplied by Cygwin now.

 * The function attributes extensions are used to catch mistakes in
   use of our own variadic functions that use NULL sentinel at the end
   (i.e. like execl(3)) and format strings (i.e. like printf(3)).

 * The code to allow configuration data to be read from in-tree blob
   objects is in.  This may help working in a bare repository and
   submodule updates.

 * Fetching between repositories with many refs employed O(n^2)
   algorithm to match up the common objects, which has been corrected.

 * The original way to specify remote repository using .git/branches/
   used to have a nifty feature.  The code to support the feature was
   still in a function but the caller was changed not to call it 5
   years ago, breaking that feature and leaving the supporting code
   unreachable.  The dead code has been removed.

 * "git pack-refs" that races with new ref creation or deletion have
   been susceptible to lossage of refs under right conditions, which
   has been tightened up.

 * We read loose and packed references in two steps, but after
   deciding to read a loose ref but before actually opening it to read
   it, another process racing with us can unlink it, which would cause
   us to barf.  The codepath has been updated to retry when such a
   race is detected, instead of outright failing.

 * Uses of the platform fnmatch(3) function (many places in the code,
   matching pathspec, .gitignore and .gitattributes to name a few)
   have been replaced with wildmatch, allowing "foo/**/bar" that would
   match foo/bar, foo/a/bar, foo/a/b/bar, etc.

 * Memory ownership and lifetime rules for what for-each-ref feeds to
   its callbacks have been clarified (in short, "you do not own it, so
   make a copy if you want to keep it").

 * The revision traversal logic to improve culling of irrelevant
   parents while traversing a mergy history has been updated.

 * Some leaks in unpack-trees (used in merge, cherry-pick and other
   codepaths) have been plugged.

 * The codepath to read from marks files in fast-import/export did not
   have to accept anything but 40-hex representation of the object
   name.  Further, fast-export did not need full in-core object
   representation to have parsed wen reading from them.  These
   codepaths have been optimized by taking advantage of these access
   patterns.

 * Object lookup logic, when the object hashtable starts to become
   crowded, has been optimized.

 * When TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY setting is used, it was handled somewhat
   inconsistently between the test framework and t/Makefile, and logic
   to summarize the results looked at a wrong place.

 * "git clone" uses a lighter-weight implementation when making sure
   that the history behind refs are complete.

 * Many warnings from sparse source checker in compat/ area has been
   squelched.

 * The code to reading and updating packed-refs file has been updated,
   correcting corner case bugs.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.3
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.3 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * Newer Net::SMTP::SSL module does not want the user programs to use
   the default behaviour to let server certificate go without
   verification, so by default enable the verification with a
   mechanism to turn it off if needed.
   (merge 35035bb rr/send-email-ssl-verify later to maint).

 * When "git" is spawned in such a way that any of the low 3 file
   descriptors is closed, our first open() may yield file descriptor 2,
   and writing error message to it would screw things up in a big way.
   (merge a11c396 tr/protect-low-3-fds later to maint).

 * The mailmap mechanism unnecessarily downcased the e-mail addresses
   in the output, and also ignored the human name when it is a single
   character name.
   (merge bd23794 jc/mailmap-case-insensitivity later to maint).

 * In two places we did not check return value (expected to be a file
   descriptor) correctly.
   (merge a77f106 tr/fd-gotcha-fixes later to maint).

 * Logic to auto-detect character encodings in the commit log message
   did not reject overlong and invalid UTF-8 characters.
   (merge 81050ac bc/commit-invalid-utf8 later to maint).

 * Pass port number as a separate argument when "send-email" initializes
   Net::SMTP, instead of as a part of the hostname, i.e. host:port.
   This allows GSSAPI codepath to match with the hostname given.
   (merge 1a741bf bc/send-email-use-port-as-separate-param later to maint).

 * "git diff" refused to even show difference when core.safecrlf is
   set to true (i.e. error out) and there are offending lines in the
   working tree files.
   (merge 5430bb2 jc/maint-diff-core-safecrlf later to maint).

 * A test that should have failed but didn't revealed a bug that needs
   to be corrected.
   (merge 94d75d1 jc/t1512-fix later to maint).

 * An overlong path to a .git directory may have overflown the
   temporary path buffer used to create a name for lockfiles.
   (merge 2fbd4f9 mh/maint-lockfile-overflow later to maint).

 * Invocations of "git checkout" used internally by "git rebase" were
   counted as "checkout", and affected later "git checkout -" to the
   the user to an unexpected place.
   (merge 3bed291 rr/rebase-checkout-reflog later to maint).

 * The configuration variable column.ui was poorly documented.
   (merge 5e62cc1 rr/column-doc later to maint).

 * "git name-rev --refs=tags/v*" were forbidden, which was a bit
   inconvenient (you had to give a pattern to match refs fully, like
   --refs=refs/tags/v*).
   (merge 98c5c4a nk/name-rev-abbreviated-refs later to maint).

 * "git apply" parsed patches that add new files, generated by
   programs other than Git, incorrectly.  This is an old breakage in
   v1.7.11 and will need to be merged down to the maintenance tracks.

 * Older cURL wanted piece of memory we call it with to be stable, but
   we updated the auth material after handing it to a call.

 * "git pull" into nothing trashed "local changes" that were in the
   index, and this avoids it.

 * Many "git submodule" operations do not work on a submodule at a
   path whose name is not in ASCII.

 * "cherry-pick" had a small leak in an error codepath.

 * Logic used by git-send-email to suppress cc mishandled names like
   "A U. Thor" <author@example.xz>, where the human readable part
   needs to be quoted (the user input may not have the double quotes
   around the name, and comparison was done between quoted and
   unquoted strings).  It also mishandled names that need RFC2047
   quoting.

 * Call to discard_cache/discard_index (used when we use different
   contents of the index in-core, in many operations like commit,
   apply, and merge) used to leak memory that held the array of index
   entries, which has been plugged.
   (merge a0fc4db rs/discard-index-discard-array later to maint).

 * "gitweb" forgot to clear a global variable $search_regexp upon each
   request, mistakenly carrying over the previous search to a new one
   when used as a persistent CGI.

 * The wildmatch engine did not honor WM_CASEFOLD option correctly.

 * "git log -c --follow $path" segfaulted upon hitting the commit that
   renamed the $path being followed.

 * When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch", we
   did not say which branch and worse said "branch ''".

 * "difftool --dir-diff" did not copy back changes made by the
   end-user in the diff tool backend to the working tree in some
   cases.

 * "git push $there HEAD:branch" did not resolve HEAD early enough, so
   it was easy to flip it around while push is still going on and push
   out a branch that the user did not originally intended when the
   command was started.

 * The bash prompt code (in contrib/) displayed the name of the branch
   being rebased when "rebase -i/-m/-p" modes are in use, but not the
   plain vanilla "rebase".

 * Handling of negative exclude pattern for directories "!dir" was
   broken in the update to v1.8.3.

 * zsh prompt script that borrowed from bash prompt script did not
   work due to slight differences in array variable notation between
   these two shells.

 * An entry for "file://" scheme in the enumeration of URL types Git
   can take in the HTML documentation was made into a clickable link
   by mistake.

 * "git push --[no-]verify" was not documented.

 * Stop installing the git-remote-testpy script that is only used for
   testing.

 * "git commit --allow-empty-message -m ''" should not start an
   editor.

 * "git merge @{-1}~22" was rewritten to "git merge frotz@{1}~22"
   incorrectly when your previous branch was "frotz" (it should be
   rewritten to "git merge frotz~22" instead).

 * "git diff -c -p" was not showing a deleted line from a hunk when
   another hunk immediately begins where the earlier one ends.

 * "git log --ancestry-path A...B" did not work as expected, as it did
   not pay attention to the fact that the merge base between A and B
   was the bottom of the range being specified.

 * Mac OS X does not like to write(2) more than INT_MAX number of
   bytes; work it around by chopping write(2) into smaller pieces.

 * Newer MacOS X encourages the programs to compile and link with
   their CommonCrypto, not with OpenSSL.

 * "git clone foo/bar:baz" cannot be a request to clone from a remote
   over git-over-ssh specified in the scp style.  This case is now
   detected and clones from a local repository at "foo/bar:baz".

 * When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
   used to complain and die. Loosen the check.

 * "git subtree" (in contrib/) had one codepath with loose error
   checks to lose data at the remote side.

 * "git fetch" into a shallow repository from a repository that does
   not know about the shallow boundary commits (e.g. a different fork
   from the repository the current shallow repository was cloned from)
   did not work correctly.

 * "git checkout foo" DWIMs the intended "upstream" and turns it into
   "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo". This codepath has been
   updated to correctly take existing remote definitions into account.

--------------------

 * The "--[no-]informative-errors" options to "git daemon" were parsed
   a bit too loosely, allowing any other string after these option
   names.

 * A "gc" process running as a different user should be able to stop a
   new "gc" process from starting.

 * An earlier "clean-up" introduced an unnecessary memory leak to the
   credential subsystem.

 * "git mv A B/", when B does not exist as a directory, should error
   out, but it didn't.

 * "git rev-parse <revs> -- <paths>" did not implement the usual
   disambiguation rules the commands in the "git log" family used in
   the same way.

 * "git cat-file --batch=", an admittedly useless command, did not
   behave very well.

 * "git fetch --depth=0" was a no-op, and was silently ignored.
   Diagnose it as an error.

 * Remote repository URL expressed in scp-style host:path notation are
   parsed more carefully (e.g. "foo/bar:baz" is local, "[::1]:/~user" asks
   to connect to user's home directory on host at address ::1.

 * SSL-related options were not passed correctly to underlying socket
   layer in "git send-email".

 * "git commit -v" appends the patch to the log message before
   editing, and then removes the patch when the editor returned
   control. However, the patch was not stripped correctly when the
   first modified path was a submodule.

 * "git mv A B/", when B does not exist as a directory, should error
   out, but it didn't.

 * When we figure out how many file descriptors to allocate for
   keeping packfiles open, a system with non-working getrlimit() could
   cause us to die(), but because we make this call only to get a
   rough estimate of how many is available and we do not even attempt
   to use up all file descriptors available ourselves, it is nicer to
   fall back to a reasonable low value rather than dying.

 * "git log --decorate" did not handle a tag pointed by another tag
   nicely.

 * "git add -A" (no other arguments) in a totally empty working tree
   used to emit an error.

 * There is no reason to have a hardcoded upper limit of the number of
   parents for an octopus merge, created via the graft mechanism, but
   there was.

 * The implementation of 'git stash $cmd "stash@{...}"' did not quote
   the stash argument properly and left it split at IFS whitespace.

 * The documentation to "git pull" hinted there is an "-m" option
   because it incorrectly shared the documentation with "git merge".

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.5.4
--------------------

 * The pathspec matching code, while comparing two trees (e.g. "git
   diff A B -- path1 path2") was too aggressive and failed to match
   some paths when multiple pathspecs were involved.

 * "git repack --max-pack-size=8g" stopped being parsed correctly when
   the command was reimplemented in C.

 * A recent update to "git send-email" broke platforms where
   /etc/ssl/certs/ directory exists but cannot be used as SSL_ca_path
   (e.g. Fedora rawhide).

 * A handful of bugs around interpreting $branch@{upstream} notation
   and its lookalike, when $branch part has interesting characters,
   e.g. "@", and ":", have been fixed.

 * "git clone" would fail to clone from a repository that has a ref
   directly under "refs/", e.g. "refs/stash", because different
   validation paths do different things on such a refname.  Loosen the
   client side's validation to allow such a ref.

 * "git log --left-right A...B" lost the "leftness" of commits
   reachable from A when A is a tag as a side effect of a recent
   bugfix.  This is a regression in 1.8.4.x series.

 * "git merge-base --octopus" used to leave cleaning up suboptimal
   result to the caller, but now it does the clean-up itself.

 * "git mv A B/", when B does not exist as a directory, should error
   out, but it didn't.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

==========================

Fixes since v1.8.5.5
--------------------

 * We used to allow committing a path ".Git/config" with Git that is
   running on a case sensitive filesystem, but an attempt to check out
   such a path with Git that runs on a case insensitive filesystem
   would have clobbered ".git/config", which is definitely not what
   the user would have expected.  Git now prevents you from tracking
   a path with ".Git" (in any case combination) as a path component.

 * On Windows, certain path components that are different from ".git"
   are mapped to ".git", e.g. "git~1/config" is treated as if it were
   ".git/config".  HFS+ has a similar issue, where certain unicode
   codepoints are ignored, e.g. ".g\u200cit/config" is treated as if
   it were ".git/config".  Pathnames with these potential issues are
   rejected on the affected systems.  Git on systems that are not
   affected by this issue (e.g. Linux) can also be configured to
   reject them to ensure cross platform interoperability of the hosted
   projects.

 * "git fsck" notices a tree object that records such a path that can
   be confused with ".git", and with receive.fsckObjects configuration
   set to true, an attempt to "git push" such a tree object will be
   rejected.  Such a path may not be a problem on a well behaving
   filesystem but in order to protect those on HFS+ and on case
   insensitive filesystems, this check is enabled on all platforms.

A big "thanks!" for bringing this issue to us goes to our friends in
the Mercurial land, namely, Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

========================

Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0)
------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics, which pushes:

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, and only
   when the current branch is set to integrate with that remote
   branch, if you are pushing to the same remote as you fetch from; or

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, if you
   are pushing to a remote that is not where you usually fetch from.

Use the user preference configuration variable "push.default" to
change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used to the "matching"
semantics, you can set the variable to "matching" to keep the
traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future early, you
can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" (and "git add -A") is run inside a subdirectory and
does not specify which paths to add on the command line, it
will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands.  There will be no
mechanism to make plain "git add -u" behave like "git add -u .".
Current users of "git add -u" (without a pathspec) should start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ."
before Git 2.0 comes.  A warning is issued when these commands are
run without a pathspec and when you have local changes outside the
current directory, because the behaviour in Git 2.0 will be different
from today's version in such a situation.

In Git 2.0, "git add <path>" will behave as "git add -A <path>", so
that "git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory
and record the removal.  Versions before Git 2.0, including this
release, will keep ignoring removals, but the users who rely on this
behaviour are encouraged to start using "git add --ignore-removal <path>"
now before 2.0 is released.

The default prefix for "git svn" will change in Git 2.0.  For a long
time, "git svn" created its remote-tracking branches directly under
refs/remotes, but it will place them under refs/remotes/origin/ unless
it is told otherwise with its --prefix option.


Updates since v1.8.4
--------------------

Foreign interfaces, subsystems and ports.

 * "git-svn" has been taught to use the serf library, which is the
   only option SVN 1.8.0 offers us when talking the HTTP protocol.

 * "git-svn" talking over an https:// connection using the serf library
   dumped core due to a bug in the serf library that SVN uses.  Work
   around it on our side, even though the SVN side is being fixed.

 * On MacOS X, we detected if the filesystem needs the "pre-composed
   unicode strings" workaround, but did not automatically enable it.
   Now we do.

 * remote-hg remote helper misbehaved when interacting with a local Hg
   repository relative to the home directory, e.g. "clone hg::~/there".

 * imap-send ported to OS X uses Apple's security framework instead of
   OpenSSL's.

 * "git fast-import" treats an empty path given to "ls" as the root of
   the tree.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * xdg-open can be used as a browser backend for "git web-browse"
   (hence to show "git help -w" output), when available.

 * "git grep" and "git show" pay attention to the "--textconv" option
   when these commands are told to operate on blob objects (e.g. "git
   grep -e pattern --textconv HEAD:Makefile").

 * "git replace" helper no longer allows an object to be replaced with
   another object of a different type to avoid confusion (you can
   still manually craft such a replacement using "git update-ref", as an
   escape hatch).

 * "git status" no longer prints the dirty status information of
   submodules for which submodule.$name.ignore is set to "all".

 * "git rebase -i" honours core.abbrev when preparing the insn sheet
   for editing.

 * "git status" during a cherry-pick shows which original commit is
   being picked.

 * Instead of typing four capital letters "HEAD", you can say "@" now,
   e.g. "git log @".

 * "git check-ignore" follows the same rule as "git add" and "git
   status" in that the ignore/exclude mechanism does not take effect
   on paths that are already tracked.  With the "--no-index" option, it
   can be used to diagnose which paths that should have been ignored
   have been mistakenly added to the index.

 * Some irrelevant "advice" messages that are shared with "git status"
   output have been removed from the commit log template.

 * "update-refs" learned a "--stdin" option to read multiple update
   requests and perform them in an all-or-none fashion.

 * Just like "make -C <directory>", "git -C <directory> ..." tells Git
   to go there before doing anything else.

 * Just like "git checkout -" knows to check out, and "git merge -"
   knows to merge, the branch you were previously on, "git cherry-pick"
   now understands "git cherry-pick -" to pick from the previous
   branch.

 * "git status" now omits the prefix to make its output a comment in a
   commit log editor, which is not necessary for human consumption.
   Scripts that parse the output of "git status" are advised to use
   "git status --porcelain" instead, as its format is stable and easier
   to parse.

 * The ref syntax "foo^{tag}" (with the literal string "{tag}") peels a
   tag ref to itself, i.e. it's a no-op., and fails if
   "foo" is not a tag.  "git rev-parse --verify v1.0^{tag}" is
   a more convenient way than "test $(git cat-file -t v1.0) = tag" to
   check if v1.0 is a tag.

 * "git branch -v -v" (and "git status") did not distinguish among a
   branch that is not based on any other branch, a branch that is in
   sync with its upstream branch, and a branch that is configured with an
   upstream branch that no longer exists.

 * Earlier we started rejecting any attempt to add the 0{40} object name to
   the index and to tree objects, but it sometimes is necessary to
   allow this to be able to use tools like filter-branch to correct such
   broken tree objects.  "filter-branch" can again be used to do this.

 * "git config" did not provide a way to set or access numbers larger
   than a native "int" on the platform; it now provides 64-bit signed
   integers on all platforms.

 * "git pull --rebase" always chose to do the bog-standard flattening
   rebase.  You can tell it to run "rebase --preserve-merges" with
   "git pull --rebase=preserve" or by
   setting "pull.rebase" configuration to "preserve".

 * "git push --no-thin" actually disables the "thin pack transfer"
   optimization.

 * Magic pathspecs like ":(icase)makefile" (matches both Makefile
   and makefile) and ":(glob)foo/**/bar" (matches "bar" in "foo"
   and any subdirectory of "foo") can be used in more places.

 * The "http.*" variables can now be specified for individual URLs.
   For example,

   [http]
       sslVerify = true
   [http "https://weak.example.com/"]
       sslVerify = false

   would flip http.sslVerify off only when talking to that specific
   site.

 * "git mv A B" when moving a submodule has been taught to
   relocate the submodule's working tree and to adjust the paths in the
   .gitmodules file.

 * "git blame" can now take more than one -L option to discover the
   origin of multiple blocks of lines.

 * The http transport clients can optionally ask to save cookies
   with the http.savecookies configuration variable.

 * "git push" learned a more fine grained control over a blunt
   "--force" when requesting a non-fast-forward update with the
   "--force-with-lease=<refname>:<expected object name>" option.

 * "git diff --diff-filter=<classes of changes>" can now take
   lowercase letters (e.g. "--diff-filter=d") to mean "show
   everything but these classes".  "git diff-files -q" is now a
   deprecated synonym for "git diff-files --diff-filter=d".

 * "git fetch" (hence "git pull" as well) learned to check
   "fetch.prune" and "remote.*.prune" configuration variables and
   to behave as if the "--prune" command line option was given.

 * "git check-ignore -z" applied the NUL termination to both its input
   (with --stdin) and its output, but "git check-attr -z" ignored the
   option on the output side. Make both honor -z on the input and
   output side the same way.

 * "git whatchanged" may still be used by old timers, but mention of
   it in documents meant for new users will only waste readers' time
   wondering what the difference is between it and "git log".  Make it
   less prominent in the general part of the documentation and explain
   that it is merely a "git log" with different default behaviour in
   its own document.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * "git for-each-ref" when asking for merely the object name does not
   have to parse the object pointed at by the refs; the codepath has
   been optimized.

 * The HTTP transport will try to use TCP keepalive when able.

 * "git repack" is now written in C.

 * Build procedure for MSVC has been updated.

 * If a build-time fallback is set to "cat" instead of "less", we
   should apply the same "no subprocess or pipe" optimization as we
   apply to user-supplied GIT_PAGER=cat.

 * Many commands use a --dashed-option as an operation mode selector
   (e.g. "git tag --delete") that excludes other operation modes
   (e.g. "git tag --delete --verify" is nonsense) and that cannot be
   negated (e.g. "git tag --no-delete" is nonsense).  The parse-options
   API learned a new OPT_CMDMODE macro to make it easier to implement
   such a set of options.

 * OPT_BOOLEAN() in the parse-options API was misdesigned to be "counting
   up" but many subcommands expect it to behave as "on/off". Update
   them to use OPT_BOOL() which is a proper boolean.

 * "git gc" exits early without doing any work when it detects
   that another instance of itself is already running.

 * Under memory pressure and/or file descriptor pressure, we used to
   close pack windows that are not used and also closed filehandles to
   open but unused packfiles. These are now controlled separately
   to better cope with the load.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.4
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.4 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases' notes for
details).

 * An ancient How-To on serving Git repositories on an HTTP server
   lacked a warning that it has been mostly superseded with a more
   modern way.
   (merge 6d52bc3 sc/doc-howto-dumb-http later to maint).

 * The interaction between the use of Perl in our test suite and NO_PERL
   has been clarified a bit.
   (merge f8fc0ee jn/test-prereq-perl-doc later to maint).

 * The synopsis section of the "git unpack-objects" documentation has been
   clarified a bit.
   (merge 61e2e22 vd/doc-unpack-objects later to maint).

 * We did not generate the HTML version of the documentation to "git subtree"
   in contrib/.
   (merge 95c62fb jk/subtree-install-fix later to maint).

 * A fast-import stream expresses a pathname with funny characters by
   quoting them in C style; the remote-hg remote helper forgot to unquote
   such a path.
   (merge 1136265 ap/remote-hg-unquote-cquote later to maint).

 * "git reset -p HEAD" has a codepath to special-case it to behave
   differently from resetting to contents of other commits, but a
   recent change broke it.

 * Coloring around octopus merges in "log --graph" output was screwy.
   (merge 339c17b hn/log-graph-color-octopus later to maint).

 * "git checkout topic", when there is not yet a local "topic" branch
   but there is a unique remote-tracking branch for a remote "topic"
   branch, pretended as if "git checkout -t -b topic remote/$r/topic"
   (for that unique remote $r) was run. This hack however was not
   implemented for "git checkout topic --".
   (merge bca3969 mm/checkout-auto-track-fix later to maint).

 * One long-standing flaw in the pack transfer protocol used by "git
   clone" was that there was no way to tell the other end which branch
   "HEAD" points at, and the receiving end needed to guess.  A new
   capability has been defined in the pack protocol to convey this
   information so that cloning from a repository with more than one
   branch pointing at the same commit where the HEAD is at now
   reliably sets the initial branch in the resulting repository.
   (merge 360a326 jc/upload-pack-send-symref later to maint).

 * We did not handle cases where the http transport gets redirected during
   the authorization request (e.g. from http:// to https://).
   (merge 70900ed jk/http-auth-redirects later to maint).

 * Bash prompting code to deal with an SVN remote as an upstream
   was coded in a way unsupported by older Bash versions (3.x).
   (merge 52ec889 sg/prompt-svn-remote-fix later to maint).

 * The fall-back parsing of commit objects with broken author or
   committer lines was less robust than ideal in picking up the
   timestamps.
   (merge 03818a4 jk/split-broken-ident later to maint).

 * "git rev-list --objects ^v1.0^ v1.0" gave the v1.0 tag itself in the
   output, but "git rev-list --objects v1.0^..v1.0" did not.
   (merge 895c5ba jc/revision-range-unpeel later to maint).

 * "git clone" wrote some progress messages to standard output, not
   to standard error, and did not suppress them with the
   --no-progress option.
   (merge 643f918 jk/clone-progress-to-stderr later to maint).

 * "format-patch --from=<whom>" forgot to omit an unnecessary in-body
   from line, i.e. when <whom> is the same as the real author.
   (merge 662cc30 jk/format-patch-from later to maint).

 * "git shortlog" used to choke and die when there is a malformed
   commit (e.g. missing authors); it now simply ignores such a commit
   and keeps going.
   (merge cd4f09e jk/shortlog-tolerate-broken-commit later to maint).

 * "git merge-recursive" did not parse its "--diff-algorithm=" command
   line option correctly.
   (merge 6562928 jk/diff-algo later to maint).

 * When running "fetch -q", a long silence while the sender side
   computes the set of objects to send can be mistaken by proxies as
   dropped connection.  The server side has been taught to send a
   small empty messages to keep the connection alive.
   (merge 115dedd jk/upload-pack-keepalive later to maint).

 * "git rebase" had a portability regression in v1.8.4 that triggered a
   bug in some BSD shell implementations.
   (merge 99855dd mm/rebase-continue-freebsd-WB later to maint).

 * "git branch --track" had a minor regression in v1.8.3.2 and later
   that made it impossible to base your local work on anything but a
   local branch of the upstream repository you are tracking.
   (merge b0f49ff jh/checkout-auto-tracking later to maint).

 * When the web server responds with "405 Method Not Allowed", "git
   http-backend" should tell the client what methods are allowed with
   the "Allow" header.
   (merge 9247be0 bc/http-backend-allow-405 later to maint).

 * When there is no sufficient overlap between old and new history
   during a "git fetch" into a shallow repository, objects that the
   sending side knows the receiving end has were unnecessarily sent.
   (merge f21d2a7 nd/fetch-into-shallow later to maint).

 * "git cvsserver" computed the permission mode bits incorrectly for
   executable files.
   (merge 1b48d56 jc/cvsserver-perm-bit-fix later to maint).

 * When send-email obtains an error message to die with upon
   failure to start an SSL session, it tried to read the error string
   from a wrong place.
   (merge 6cb0c88 bc/send-email-ssl-die-message-fix later to maint).

 * The implementation of "add -i" has some crippling code to work around an
   ActiveState Perl limitation but it by mistake also triggered on Git
   for Windows where MSYS perl is used.
   (merge df17e77 js/add-i-mingw later to maint).

 * We made sure that we notice when the user-supplied GIT_DIR is actually a
   gitfile, but did not do the same when the default ".git" is a
   gitfile.
   (merge 487a2b7 nd/git-dir-pointing-at-gitfile later to maint).

 * When an object is not found after checking the packfiles and the
   loose object directory, read_sha1_file() re-checks the packfiles to
   prevent racing with a concurrent repacker; teach the same logic to
   has_sha1_file().
   (merge 45e8a74 jk/has-sha1-file-retry-packed later to maint).

 * "git commit --author=$name", when $name is not in the canonical
   "A. U. Thor <au.thor@example.xz>" format, looks for a matching name
   from existing history, but did not consult mailmap to grab the
   preferred author name.
   (merge ea16794 ap/commit-author-mailmap later to maint).

 * "git ls-files -k" needs to crawl only the part of the working tree
   that may overlap the paths in the index to find killed files, but
   shared code with the logic to find all the untracked files, which
   made it unnecessarily inefficient.
   (merge 680be04 jc/ls-files-killed-optim later to maint).

 * The shortened commit object names in the insn sheet that is prepared at the
   beginning of a "rebase -i" session can become ambiguous as the
   rebasing progresses and the repository gains more commits. Make
   sure the internal record is kept with full 40-hex object names.
   (merge 75c6976 es/rebase-i-no-abbrev later to maint).

 * "git rebase --preserve-merges" internally used the merge machinery
   and as a side effect left the merge summary message in the log, but
   when rebasing there is no need for the merge summary.
   (merge a9f739c rt/rebase-p-no-merge-summary later to maint).

 * A call to xread() was used without a loop around it to cope with short
   reads in the codepath to stream new contents to a pack.
   (merge e92527c js/xread-in-full later to maint).

 * "git rebase -i" forgot that the comment character is
   configurable while reading its insn sheet.
   (merge 7bca7af es/rebase-i-respect-core-commentchar later to maint).

 * The mailmap support code read past the allocated buffer when the
   mailmap file ended with an incomplete line.
   (merge f972a16 jk/mailmap-incomplete-line later to maint).

 * We used to send a large request to read(2)/write(2) as a single
   system call, which was bad from the latency point of view when
   the operation needs to be killed, and also triggered an error on
   broken 64-bit systems that refuse to read or write more than 2GB
   in one go.
   (merge a487916 sp/clip-read-write-to-8mb later to maint).

 * "git fetch" that auto-followed tags incorrectly reused the
   connection with Git-aware transport helper (like the sample "ext::"
   helper shipped with Git).
   (merge 0f73f8b jc/transport-do-not-use-connect-twice-in-fetch later to maint).

 * "git log --full-diff -- <pathspec>" showed a huge diff for paths
   outside the given <pathspec> for each commit, instead of showing
   the change relative to the parent of the commit.  "git reflog -p"
   had a similar problem.
   (merge 838f9a1 tr/log-full-diff-keep-true-parents later to maint).

 * Setting a submodule.*.path configuration variable to true (without
   giving "= value") caused Git to segfault.
   (merge 4b05440 jl/some-submodule-config-are-not-boolean later to maint).

 * "git rebase -i" (there could be others, as the root cause is pretty
   generic) fed a random, data dependent string to 'echo' and
   expected it to come out literally, corrupting its error message.
   (merge 89b0230 mm/no-shell-escape-in-die-message later to maint).

 * Some people still use rather old versions of bash, which cannot
   grok some constructs like 'printf -v varname' which the prompt and
   completion code started to use recently.
   (merge a44aa69 bc/completion-for-bash-3.0 later to maint).

 * Code to read configuration from a blob object did not compile on
   platforms with fgetc() etc. implemented as macros.
   (merge 49d6cfa hv/config-from-blob later to maint-1.8.3).

 * The recent "short-cut clone connectivity check" topic broke a
   shallow repository when a fetch operation tries to auto-follow tags.
   (merge 6da8bdc nd/fetch-pack-shallow-fix later to maint-1.8.3).

========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

"git submodule foreach $cmd $args" used to treat "$cmd $args" the same
way "ssh" did, concatenating them into a single string and letting the
shell unquote. Careless users who forget to sufficiently quote $args
get their argument split at $IFS whitespaces by the shell, and got
unexpected results due to this. Starting from this release, the
command line is passed directly to the shell, if it has an argument.

Read-only support for experimental loose-object format, in which users
could optionally choose to write their loose objects for a short
while between v1.4.3 and v1.5.3 era, has been dropped.

The meanings of the "--tags" option to "git fetch" has changed; the
command fetches tags _in addition to_ what is fetched by the same
command line without the option.

The way "git push $there $what" interprets the $what part given on the
command line, when it does not have a colon that explicitly tells us
what ref at the $there repository is to be updated, has been enhanced.

A handful of ancient commands that have long been deprecated are
finally gone (repo-config, tar-tree, lost-found, and peek-remote).


Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0.0)
--------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics, which pushes:

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, and only
   when the current branch is set to integrate with that remote
   branch, if you are pushing to the same remote as you fetch from; or

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, if you
   are pushing to a remote that is not where you usually fetch from.

Use the user preference configuration variable "push.default" to
change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used to the "matching"
semantics, you can set the variable to "matching" to keep the
traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future early, you
can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" (and "git add -A") is run inside a subdirectory and
does not specify which paths to add on the command line, it
will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands.  There will be no
mechanism to make plain "git add -u" behave like "git add -u .".
Current users of "git add -u" (without a pathspec) should start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ."
before Git 2.0 comes.  A warning is issued when these commands are
run without a pathspec and when you have local changes outside the
current directory, because the behaviour in Git 2.0 will be different
from today's version in such a situation.

In Git 2.0, "git add <path>" will behave as "git add -A <path>", so
that "git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory
and record the removal.  Versions before Git 2.0, including this
release, will keep ignoring removals, but the users who rely on this
behaviour are encouraged to start using "git add --ignore-removal <path>"
now before 2.0 is released.

The default prefix for "git svn" will change in Git 2.0.  For a long
time, "git svn" created its remote-tracking branches directly under
refs/remotes, but it will place them under refs/remotes/origin/ unless
it is told otherwise with its --prefix option.


Updates since v1.8.5
--------------------

Foreign interfaces, subsystems and ports.

 * The HTTP transport, when talking GSS-Negotiate, uses "100
   Continue" response to avoid having to rewind and resend a large
   payload, which may not be always doable.

 * Various bugfixes to remote-bzr and remote-hg (in contrib/).

 * The build procedure is aware of MirBSD now.

 * Various "git p4", "git svn" and "gitk" updates.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * Fetching from a shallowly-cloned repository used to be forbidden,
   primarily because the codepaths involved were not carefully vetted
   and we did not bother supporting such usage. This release attempts
   to allow object transfer out of a shallowly-cloned repository in a
   more controlled way (i.e. the receiver becomes a shallow repository
   with a truncated history).

 * Just like we give a reasonable default for "less" via the LESS
   environment variable, we now specify a reasonable default for "lv"
   via the "LV" environment variable when spawning the pager.

 * Two-level configuration variable names in "branch.*" and "remote.*"
   hierarchies, whose variables are predominantly three-level, were
   not completed by hitting a <TAB> in bash and zsh completions.

 * Fetching a 'frotz' branch with "git fetch", while a 'frotz/nitfol'
   remote-tracking branch from an earlier fetch was still there, would
   error out, primarily because the command was not told that it is
   allowed to lose any information on our side.  "git fetch --prune"
   now can be used to remove 'frotz/nitfol' to make room for fetching and
   storing the 'frotz' remote-tracking branch.

 * "diff.orderfile=<file>" configuration variable can be used to
   pretend as if the "-O<file>" option were given from the command
   line of "git diff", etc.

 * The negative pathspec syntax allows "git log -- . ':!dir'" to tell
   us "I am interested in everything but 'dir' directory".

 * "git difftool" shows how many different paths there are in total,
   and how many of them have been shown so far, to indicate progress.

 * "git push origin master" used to push our 'master' branch to update
   the 'master' branch at the 'origin' repository.  This has been
   enhanced to use the same ref mapping "git push origin" would use to
   determine what ref at the 'origin' to be updated with our 'master'.
   For example, with this configuration

   [remote "origin"]
      push = refs/heads/*:refs/review/*

   that would cause "git push origin" to push out our local branches
   to corresponding refs under refs/review/ hierarchy at 'origin',
   "git push origin master" would update 'refs/review/master' over
   there.  Alternatively, if push.default is set to 'upstream' and our
   'master' is set to integrate with 'topic' from the 'origin' branch,
   running "git push origin" while on our 'master' would update their
   'topic' branch, and running "git push origin master" while on any
   of our branches does the same.

 * "gitweb" learned to treat ref hierarchies other than refs/heads as
   if they are additional branch namespaces (e.g. refs/changes/ in
   Gerrit).

 * "git for-each-ref --format=..." learned a few formatting directives;
   e.g. "%(color:red)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(refname:short) %(subject)".

 * The command string given to "git submodule foreach" is passed
   directly to the shell, without being eval'ed.  This is a backward
   incompatible change that may break existing users.

 * "git log" and friends learned the "--exclude=<glob>" option, to
   allow people to say "list history of all branches except those that
   match this pattern" with "git log --exclude='*/*' --branches".

 * "git rev-parse --parseopt" learned a new "--stuck-long" option to
   help scripts parse options with an optional parameter.

 * The "--tags" option to "git fetch" no longer tells the command to
   fetch _only_ the tags. It instead fetches tags _in addition to_
   what are fetched by the same command line without the option.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * When parsing a 40-hex string into the object name, the string is
   checked to see if it can be interpreted as a ref so that a warning
   can be given for ambiguity. The code kicked in even when the
   core.warnambiguousrefs is set to false to squelch this warning, in
   which case the cycles spent to look at the ref namespace were an
   expensive no-op, as the result was discarded without being used.

 * The naming convention of the packfiles has been updated; it used to
   be based on the enumeration of names of the objects that are
   contained in the pack, but now it also depends on how the packed
   result is represented---packing the same set of objects using
   different settings (or delta order) would produce a pack with
   different name.

 * "git diff --no-index" mode used to unnecessarily attempt to read
   the index when there is one.

 * The deprecated parse-options macro OPT_BOOLEAN has been removed;
   use OPT_BOOL or OPT_COUNTUP in new code.

 * A few duplicate implementations of prefix/suffix string comparison
   functions have been unified to starts_with() and ends_with().

 * The new PERLLIB_EXTRA makefile variable can be used to specify
   additional directories Perl modules (e.g. the ones necessary to run
   git-svn) are installed on the platform when building.

 * "git merge-base" learned the "--fork-point" mode, that implements
   the same logic used in "git pull --rebase" to find a suitable fork
   point out of the reflog entries for the remote-tracking branch the
   work has been based on.  "git rebase" has the same logic that can be
   triggered with the "--fork-point" option.

 * A third-party "receive-pack" (the responder to "git push") can
   advertise the "no-thin" capability to tell "git push" not to use
   the thin-pack optimization. Our receive-pack has always been
   capable of accepting and fattening a thin-pack, and will continue
   not to ask "git push" to use a non-thin pack.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.8.5
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.5 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases' notes
for details).

 * The pathspec matching code, while comparing two trees (e.g. "git
   diff A B -- path1 path2") was too aggressive and failed to match
   some paths when multiple pathspecs were involved.

 * "git repack --max-pack-size=8g" stopped being parsed correctly when
   the command was reimplemented in C.

 * An earlier update in v1.8.4.x to "git rev-list --objects" with
   negative ref had a performance regression.
   (merge 200abe7 jk/mark-edges-uninteresting later to maint).

 * A recent update to "git send-email" broke platforms where
   /etc/ssl/certs/ directory exists but cannot be used as SSL_ca_path
   (e.g. Fedora rawhide).

 * A handful of bugs around interpreting $branch@{upstream} notation
   and its lookalike, when $branch part has interesting characters,
   e.g. "@", and ":", have been fixed.

 * "git clone" would fail to clone from a repository that has a ref
   directly under "refs/", e.g. "refs/stash", because different
   validation paths do different things on such a refname.  Loosen the
   client side's validation to allow such a ref.

 * "git log --left-right A...B" lost the "leftness" of commits
   reachable from A when A is a tag as a side effect of a recent
   bugfix.  This is a regression in 1.8.4.x series.

 * documentations to "git pull" hinted there is an "-m" option because
   it incorrectly shared the documentation with "git merge".

 * "git diff A B submod" and "git diff A B submod/" ought to have done
   the same for a submodule "submod", but didn't.

 * "git clone $origin foo\bar\baz" on Windows failed to create the
   leading directories (i.e. a moral-equivalent of "mkdir -p").

 * "submodule.*.update=checkout", when propagated from .gitmodules to
   .git/config, turned into a "submodule.*.update=none", which did not
   make much sense.
   (merge efa8fd7 fp/submodule-checkout-mode later to maint).

 * The implementation of 'git stash $cmd "stash@{...}"' did not quote
   the stash argument properly and left it split at IFS whitespace.

 * The "--[no-]informative-errors" options to "git daemon" were parsed
   a bit too loosely, allowing any other string after these option
   names.

 * There is no reason to have a hardcoded upper limit for the number of
   parents of an octopus merge, created via the graft mechanism, but
   there was.

 * The basic test used to leave unnecessary trash directories in the
   t/ directory.
   (merge 738a8be jk/test-framework-updates later to maint).

 * "git merge-base --octopus" used to leave cleaning up suboptimal
   result to the caller, but now it does the clean-up itself.

 * A "gc" process running as a different user should be able to stop a
   new "gc" process from starting, but it didn't.

 * An earlier "clean-up" introduced an unnecessary memory leak.

 * "git add -A" (no other arguments) in a totally empty working tree
   used to emit an error.

 * "git log --decorate" did not handle a tag pointed by another tag
   nicely.

 * When we figure out how many file descriptors to allocate for
   keeping packfiles open, a system with non-working getrlimit() could
   cause us to die(), but because we make this call only to get a
   rough estimate of how many are available and we do not even attempt
   to use up all available file descriptors ourselves, it is nicer to
   fall back to a reasonable low value rather than dying.

 * read_sha1_file(), that is the workhorse to read the contents given
   an object name, honoured object replacements, but there was no
   corresponding mechanism to sha1_object_info() that was used to
   obtain the metainfo (e.g. type & size) about the object.  This led
   callers to weird inconsistencies.
   (merge 663a856 cc/replace-object-info later to maint).

 * "git cat-file --batch=", an admittedly useless command, did not
   behave very well.

 * "git rev-parse <revs> -- <paths>" did not implement the usual
   disambiguation rules the commands in the "git log" family used in
   the same way.

 * "git mv A B/", when B does not exist as a directory, should error
   out, but it didn't.

 * A workaround to an old bug in glibc prior to glibc 2.17 has been
   retired; this would remove a side effect of the workaround that
   corrupts system error messages in non-C locales.

 * SSL-related options were not passed correctly to underlying socket
   layer in "git send-email".

 * "git commit -v" appends the patch to the log message before
   editing, and then removes the patch when the editor returned
   control. However, the patch was not stripped correctly when the
   first modified path was a submodule.

 * "git fetch --depth=0" was a no-op, and was silently ignored.
   Diagnose it as an error.

 * Remote repository URLs expressed in scp-style host:path notation are
   parsed more carefully (e.g. "foo/bar:baz" is local, "[::1]:/~user" asks
   to connect to user's home directory on host at address ::1.

 * "git diff -- ':(icase)makefile'" was unnecessarily rejected at the
   command line parser.

 * "git cat-file --batch-check=ok" did not check the existence of
   the named object.

 * "git am --abort" sometimes complained about not being able to write
   a tree with an 0{40} object in it.

 * Two processes creating loose objects at the same time could have
   failed unnecessarily when the name of their new objects started
   with the same byte value, due to a race condition.

========================

Fixes since v1.9.0
------------------

 * "git clean -d pathspec" did not use the given pathspec correctly
   and ended up cleaning too much.

 * "git difftool" misbehaved when the repository is bound to the
   working tree with the ".git file" mechanism, where a textual file
   ".git" tells us where it is.

 * "git push" did not pay attention to branch.*.pushremote if it is
   defined earlier than remote.pushdefault; the order of these two
   variables in the configuration file should not matter, but it did
   by mistake.

 * Codepaths that parse timestamps in commit objects have been
   tightened.

 * "git diff --external-diff" incorrectly fed the submodule directory
   in the working tree to the external diff driver when it knew it is
   the same as one of the versions being compared.

 * "git reset" needs to refresh the index when working in a working
   tree (it can also be used to match the index to the HEAD in an
   otherwise bare repository), but it failed to set up the working
   tree properly, causing GIT_WORK_TREE to be ignored.

 * "git check-attr" when working on a repository with a working tree
   did not work well when the working tree was specified via the
   --work-tree (and obviously with --git-dir) option.

 * "merge-recursive" was broken in 1.7.7 era and stopped working in
   an empty (temporary) working tree, when there are renames
   involved.  This has been corrected.

 * "git rev-parse" was loose in rejecting command line arguments
   that do not make sense, e.g. "--default" without the required
   value for that option.

 * include.path variable (or any variable that expects a path that
   can use ~username expansion) in the configuration file is not a
   boolean, but the code failed to check it.

 * "git diff --quiet -- pathspec1 pathspec2" sometimes did not return
   correct status value.

 * Attempting to deepen a shallow repository by fetching over smart
   HTTP transport failed in the protocol exchange, when no-done
   extension was used.  The fetching side waited for the list of
   shallow boundary commits after the sending end stopped talking to
   it.

 * Allow "git cmd path/", when the 'path' is where a submodule is
   bound to the top-level working tree, to match 'path', despite the
   extra and unnecessary trailing slash (such a slash is often

========================

Fixes since v1.9.1
------------------

 * Documentation and in-code comments had many instances of mistaken
   use of "nor", which have been corrected.

 * "git fetch --prune", when the right-hand-side of multiple fetch
   refspecs overlap (e.g. storing "refs/heads/*" to
   "refs/remotes/origin/*", while storing "refs/frotz/*" to
   "refs/remotes/origin/fr/*"), aggressively thought that lack of
   "refs/heads/fr/otz" on the origin site meant we should remove
   "refs/remotes/origin/fr/otz" from us, without checking their
   "refs/frotz/otz" first.

   Note that such a configuration is inherently unsafe (think what
   should happen when "refs/heads/fr/otz" does appear on the origin
   site), but that is not a reason not to be extra careful.

 * "git update-ref --stdin" did not fail a request to create a ref
   when the ref already existed.

 * "git diff --no-index -Mq a b" fell into an infinite loop.

 * When it is not necessary to edit a commit log message (e.g. "git
   commit -m" is given a message without specifying "-e"), we used to
   disable the spawning of the editor by overriding GIT_EDITOR, but
   this means all the uses of the editor, other than to edit the
   commit log message, are also affected.

 * "git status --porcelain --branch" showed its output with labels
   "ahead/behind/gone" translated to the user's locale.

 * "git mv" that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
   uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to update
   its configuration.

 * Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a deep
   subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows.

 * The test helper lib-terminal always run an actual test_expect_*
   when included, which screwed up with the use of skil-all that may
   have to be done later.

 * "git index-pack" used a wrong variable to name the keep-file in an
   error message when the file cannot be written or closed.

 * "rebase -i" produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a commit
   happened to contain '\n' (or ended with '\c') due to a careless use
   of 'echo'.

 * There were a few instances of 'git-foo' remaining in the
   documentation that should have been spelled 'git foo'.

 * Serving objects from a shallow repository needs to write a
   new file to hold the temporary shallow boundaries but it was not
   cleaned when we exit due to die() or a signal.

 * When "git stash pop" stops after failing to apply the stash
   (e.g. due to conflicting changes), the stash is not dropped. State
   that explicitly in the output to let the users know.

 * The labels in "git status" output that describe the nature of
   conflicts (e.g. "both deleted") were limited to 20 bytes, which was
   too short for some l10n (e.g. fr).

 * "git p4" dealing with changes in binary files were broken by a

 * The shell prompt script (in contrib/), when using the PROMPT_COMMAND

 * "git rebase" used a POSIX shell construct FreeBSD /bin/sh does not

 * Commands that take pathspecs on the command line misbehaved when
   the pathspec is given as an absolute pathname (which is a
   practice not particularly encouraged) that points at a symbolic
   link in the working tree.

 * An earlier fix to the shell prompt script (in contrib/) for using
   the PROMPT_COMMAND interface did not correctly check if the extra
   code path needs to trigger, causing the branch name not to appear
   when 'promptvars' option is disabled in bash or PROMPT_SUBST is
   unset in zsh.

Fixes since v1.9.4
------------------

 * We used to allow committing a path ".Git/config" with Git that is
   running on a case sensitive filesystem, but an attempt to check out
   such a path with Git that runs on a case insensitive filesystem
   would have clobbered ".git/config", which is definitely not what
   the user would have expected.  Git now prevents you from tracking
   a path with ".Git" (in any case combination) as a path component.

 * On Windows, certain path components that are different from ".git"
   are mapped to ".git", e.g. "git~1/config" is treated as if it were
   ".git/config".  HFS+ has a similar issue, where certain unicode
   codepoints are ignored, e.g. ".g\u200cit/config" is treated as if
   it were ".git/config".  Pathnames with these potential issues are
   rejected on the affected systems.  Git on systems that are not
   affected by this issue (e.g. Linux) can also be configured to
   reject them to ensure cross platform interoperability of the hosted
   projects.

 * "git fsck" notices a tree object that records such a path that can
   be confused with ".git", and with receive.fsckObjects configuration
   set to true, an attempt to "git push" such a tree object will be
   rejected.  Such a path may not be a problem on a well behaving
   filesystem but in order to protect those on HFS+ and on case
   insensitive filesystems, this check is enabled on all platforms.

A big "thanks!" for bringing this issue to us goes to our friends in
the Mercurial land, namely, Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

======================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default is now the "simple" semantics,
which pushes:

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, and only
   when the current branch is set to integrate with that remote
   branch, if you are pushing to the same remote as you fetch from; or

 - only the current branch to the branch with the same name, if you
   are pushing to a remote that is not where you usually fetch from.

You can use the configuration variable "push.default" to change
this.  If you are an old-timer who wants to keep using the
"matching" semantics, you can set the variable to "matching", for
example.  Read the documentation for other possibilities.

When "git add -u" and "git add -A" are run inside a subdirectory
without specifying which paths to add on the command line, they
operate on the entire tree for consistency with "git commit -a" and
other commands (these commands used to operate only on the current
subdirectory).  Say "git add -u ." or "git add -A ." if you want to
limit the operation to the current directory.

"git add <path>" is the same as "git add -A <path>" now, so that
"git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory and
record the removal.  In older versions of Git, "git add <path>" used
to ignore removals.  You can say "git add --ignore-removal <path>" to
add only added or modified paths in <path>, if you really want to.

The "-q" option to "git diff-files", which does *NOT* mean "quiet",
has been removed (it told Git to ignore deletion, which you can do
with "git diff-files --diff-filter=d").

"git request-pull" lost a few "heuristics" that often led to mistakes.

The default prefix for "git svn" has changed in Git 2.0.  For a long
time, "git svn" created its remote-tracking branches directly under
refs/remotes, but it now places them under refs/remotes/origin/ unless
it is told otherwise with its "--prefix" option.


Updates since v1.9 series
-------------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * The "multi-mail" post-receive hook (in contrib/) has been updated
   to a more recent version from upstream.

 * The "remote-hg/bzr" remote-helper interfaces (used to be in
   contrib/) are no more.  They are now maintained separately as
   third-party plug-ins in their own repositories.

 * "git gc --aggressive" learned "--depth" option and
   "gc.aggressiveDepth" configuration variable to allow use of a less
   insane depth than the built-in default value of 250.

 * "git log" learned the "--show-linear-break" option to show where a
   single strand-of-pearls is broken in its output.

 * The "rev-parse --parseopt" mechanism used by scripted Porcelains to
   parse command-line options and to give help text learned to take
   the argv-help (the placeholder string for an option parameter,
   e.g. "key-id" in "--gpg-sign=<key-id>").

 * The pattern to find where the function begins in C/C++ used in
   "diff" and "grep -p" has been updated to improve viewing C++
   sources.

 * "git rebase" learned to interpret a lone "-" as "@{-1}", the
   branch that we were previously on.

 * "git commit --cleanup=<mode>" learned a new mode, scissors.

 * "git tag --list" output can be sorted using "version sort" with
   "--sort=version:refname".

 * Discard the accumulated "heuristics" to guess from which branch the
   result wants to be pulled from and make sure that what the end user
   specified is not second-guessed by "git request-pull", to avoid
   mistakes.  When you pushed out your 'master' branch to your public
   repository as 'for-linus', use the new "master:for-linus" syntax to
   denote the branch to be pulled.

 * "git grep" learned to behave in a way similar to native grep when
   "-h" (no header) and "-c" (count) options are given.

 * "git push" via transport-helper interface has been updated to
   allow forced ref updates in a way similar to the natively
   supported transports.

 * The "simple" mode is the default for "git push".

 * "git add -u" and "git add -A", when run without any pathspec, is a
   tree-wide operation even when run inside a subdirectory of a
   working tree.

 * "git add <path>" is the same as "git add -A <path>" now.

 * "core.statinfo" configuration variable, which is a
   never-advertised synonym to "core.checkstat", has been removed.

 * The "-q" option to "git diff-files", which does *NOT* mean
   "quiet", has been removed (it told Git to ignore deletion, which
   you can do with "git diff-files --diff-filter=d").

 * Server operators can loosen the "tips of refs only" restriction for
   the remote archive service with the uploadarchive.allowUnreachable
   configuration option.

 * The progress indicators from various time-consuming commands have
   been marked for i18n/l10n.

 * "git notes -C <blob>" diagnoses as an error an attempt to use an
   object that is not a blob.

 * "git config" learned to read from the standard input when "-" is
   given as the value to its "--file" parameter (attempting an
   operation to update the configuration in the standard input is
   rejected, of course).

 * Trailing whitespaces in .gitignore files, unless they are quoted
   for fnmatch(3), e.g. "path\ ", are warned and ignored.  Strictly
   speaking, this is a backward-incompatible change, but very unlikely
   to bite any sane user and adjusting should be obvious and easy.

 * Many commands that create commits, e.g. "pull" and "rebase",
   learned to take the "--gpg-sign" option on the command line.

 * "git commit" can be told to always GPG sign the resulting commit
   by setting the "commit.gpgsign" configuration variable to "true"
   (the command-line option "--no-gpg-sign" should override it).

 * "git pull" can be told to only accept fast-forward by setting the
   new "pull.ff" configuration variable.

 * "git reset" learned the "-N" option, which does not reset the index
   fully for paths the index knows about but the tree-ish the command
   resets to does not (these paths are kept as intend-to-add entries).


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * The compilation options to port to AIX and to MSVC have been
   updated.

 * We started using wildmatch() in place of fnmatch(3) a few releases
   ago; complete the process and stop using fnmatch(3).

 * Uses of curl's "multi" interface and "easy" interface do not mix
   well when we attempt to reuse outgoing connections.  Teach the RPC
   over HTTP code, used in the smart HTTP transport, not to use the
   "easy" interface.

 * The bitmap-index feature from JGit has been ported, which should
   significantly improve performance when serving objects from a
   repository that uses it.

 * The way "git log --cc" shows a combined diff against multiple
   parents has been optimized.

 * The prefixcmp() and suffixcmp() functions are gone.  Use
   starts_with() and ends_with(), and also consider if skip_prefix()
   suits your needs better when using the former.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.  Many
of them came from flurry of activities as GSoC candidate microproject
exercises.


Fixes since v1.9 series
-----------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.9 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git p4" was broken in 1.9 release to deal with changes in binary
   files.
   (merge 749b668 cl/p4-use-diff-tree later to maint).

 * The shell prompt script (in contrib/), when using the PROMPT_COMMAND
   interface, used an unsafe construct when showing the branch name in
   $PS1.
   (merge 1e4119c8 rh/prompt-pcmode-avoid-eval-on-refname later to maint).

 * "git rebase" used a POSIX shell construct FreeBSD's /bin/sh does not
   work well with.
   (merge 8cd6596 km/avoid-non-function-return-in-rebase later to maint).

 * zsh prompt (in contrib/) leaked unnecessary error messages.

 * Bash completion (in contrib/) did not complete the refs and remotes
   correctly given "git pu<TAB>" when "pu" is aliased to "push".

 * Some more Unicode code points, defined in Unicode 6.3 as having zero
   width, have been taught to our display column counting logic.
   (merge d813ab9 tb/unicode-6.3-zero-width later to maint).

 * Some tests used shell constructs that did not work well on FreeBSD
   (merge ff7a1c6 km/avoid-bs-in-shell-glob later to maint).
   (merge 00764ca km/avoid-cp-a later to maint).

 * "git update-ref --stdin" did not fail a request to create a ref
   when the ref already existed.
   (merge b9d56b5 mh/update-ref-batch-create-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --no-index -Mq a b" fell into an infinite loop.
   (merge ad1c3fb jc/fix-diff-no-index-diff-opt-parse later to maint).

 * "git fetch --prune", when the right-hand side of multiple fetch
   refspecs overlap (e.g. storing "refs/heads/*" to
   "refs/remotes/origin/*", while storing "refs/frotz/*" to
   "refs/remotes/origin/fr/*"), aggressively thought that lack of
   "refs/heads/fr/otz" on the origin site meant we should remove
   "refs/remotes/origin/fr/otz" from us, without checking their
   "refs/frotz/otz" first.

   Note that such a configuration is inherently unsafe (think what
   should happen when "refs/heads/fr/otz" does appear on the origin
   site), but that is not a reason not to be extra careful.
   (merge e6f6371 cn/fetch-prune-overlapping-destination later to maint).

 * "git status --porcelain --branch" showed its output with labels
   "ahead/behind/gone" translated to the user's locale.
   (merge 7a76c28 mm/status-porcelain-format-i18n-fix later to maint).

 * A stray environment variable $prefix could have leaked into and
   affected the behaviour of the "subtree" script (in contrib/).

 * When it is not necessary to edit a commit log message (e.g. "git
   commit -m" is given a message without specifying "-e"), we used to
   disable the spawning of the editor by overriding GIT_EDITOR, but
   this means all the uses of the editor, other than to edit the
   commit log message, are also affected.
   (merge b549be0 bp/commit-p-editor later to maint).

 * "git mv" that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
   uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to update
   its configuration.
   (merge fb8a4e8 jk/mv-submodules-fix later to maint).

 * Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a deep
   subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows.
   (merge 2f29e0c mh/remove-subtree-long-pathname-fix later to maint).

 * The test helper lib-terminal always run an actual test_expect_*
   when included, which screwed up with the use of skil-all that may
   have to be done later.
   (merge 7e27173 jk/lib-terminal-lazy later to maint).

 * "git index-pack" used a wrong variable to name the keep-file in an
   error message when the file cannot be written or closed.
   (merge de983a0 nd/index-pack-error-message later to maint).

 * "rebase -i" produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a commit
   happened to contain '\n' (or ended with '\c') due to a careless use
   of 'echo'.
   (merge cb1aefd us/printf-not-echo later to maint).

 * There were a few instances of 'git-foo' remaining in the
   documentation that should have been spelled 'git foo'.
   (merge 3c3e6f5 rr/doc-merge-strategies later to maint).

 * Serving objects from a shallow repository needs to write a
   new file to hold the temporary shallow boundaries, but it was not
   cleaned when we exit due to die() or a signal.
   (merge 7839632 jk/shallow-update-fix later to maint).

 * When "git stash pop" stops after failing to apply the stash
   (e.g. due to conflicting changes), the stash is not dropped. State
   that explicitly in the output to let the users know.
   (merge 2d4c993 jc/stash-pop-not-popped later to maint).

 * The labels in "git status" output that describe the nature of
   conflicts (e.g. "both deleted") were limited to 20 bytes, which was
   too short for some l10n (e.g. fr).
   (merge c7cb333 jn/wt-status later to maint).

 * "git clean -d pathspec" did not use the given pathspec correctly
   and ended up cleaning too much.
   (merge 1f2e108 jk/clean-d-pathspec later to maint).

 * "git difftool" misbehaved when the repository is bound to the
   working tree with the ".git file" mechanism, where a textual file
   ".git" tells us where it is.
   (merge fcfec8b da/difftool-git-files later to maint).

 * "git push" did not pay attention to "branch.*.pushremote" if it is
   defined earlier than "remote.pushdefault"; the order of these two
   variables in the configuration file should not matter, but it did
   by mistake.
   (merge 98b406f jk/remote-pushremote-config-reading later to maint).

 * Code paths that parse timestamps in commit objects have been
   tightened.
   (merge f80d1f9 jk/commit-dates-parsing-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --external-diff" incorrectly fed the submodule directory
   in the working tree to the external diff driver when it knew that it
   is the same as one of the versions being compared.
   (merge aba4727 tr/diff-submodule-no-reuse-worktree later to maint).

 * "git reset" needs to refresh the index when working in a working
   tree (it can also be used to match the index to the HEAD in an
   otherwise bare repository), but it failed to set up the working
   tree properly, causing GIT_WORK_TREE to be ignored.
   (merge b7756d4 nd/reset-setup-worktree later to maint).

 * "git check-attr" when working on a repository with a working tree
   did not work well when the working tree was specified via the
   "--work-tree" (and obviously with "--git-dir") option.
   (merge cdbf623 jc/check-attr-honor-working-tree later to maint).

 * "merge-recursive" was broken in 1.7.7 era and stopped working in
   an empty (temporary) working tree, when there are renames
   involved.  This has been corrected.
   (merge 6e2068a bk/refresh-missing-ok-in-merge-recursive later to maint.)

 * "git rev-parse" was loose in rejecting command-line arguments
   that do not make sense, e.g. "--default" without the required
   value for that option.
   (merge a43219f ds/rev-parse-required-args later to maint.)

 * "include.path" variable (or any variable that expects a path that
   can use ~username expansion) in the configuration file is not a
   boolean, but the code failed to check it.
   (merge 67beb60 jk/config-path-include-fix later to maint.)

 * Commands that take pathspecs on the command line misbehaved when
   the pathspec is given as an absolute pathname (which is a
   practice not particularly encouraged) that points at a symbolic
   link in the working tree.
   (merge 6127ff6 mw/symlinks later to maint.)

 * "git diff --quiet -- pathspec1 pathspec2" sometimes did not return
   the correct status value.
   (merge f34b205 nd/diff-quiet-stat-dirty later to maint.)

 * Attempting to deepen a shallow repository by fetching over smart
   HTTP transport failed in the protocol exchange, when the no-done
   extension was used.  The fetching side waited for the list of
   shallow boundary commits after the sending side stopped talking to
   it.
   (merge 0232852 nd/http-fetch-shallow-fix later to maint.)

 * Allow "git cmd path/", when the 'path' is where a submodule is
   bound to the top-level working tree, to match 'path', despite the
   extra and unnecessary trailing slash (such a slash is often
   given by command-line completion).
   (merge 2e70c01 nd/submodule-pathspec-ending-with-slash later to maint.)

 * Documentation and in-code comments had many instances of mistaken
   use of "nor", which have been corrected.
   (merge 235e8d5 jl/nor-or-nand-and later to maint).

========================

 * We used to unconditionally disable the pager in the pager process
   we spawn to feed out output, but that prevented people who want to
   run "less" within "less" from doing so.

 * Tools that read diagnostic output in our standard error stream do
   not want to see terminal control sequence (e.g. erase-to-eol).
   Detect them by checking if the standard error stream is connected
   to a tty.
 * Reworded the error message given upon a failure to open an existing
   loose object file due to e.g. permission issues; it was reported as
   the object being corrupt, but that is not quite true.

 * "git log -2master" is a common typo that shows two commits starting
   from whichever random branch that is not 'master' that happens to
   be checked out currently.

 * The "%<(10,trunc)%s" pretty format specifier in the log family of
   commands is used to truncate the string to a given length (e.g. 10
   in the example) with padding to column-align the output, but did
   not take into account that number of bytes and number of display
   columns are different.

 * The "mailmap.file" configuration option did not support the tilde
   expansion (i.e. ~user/path and ~/path).

 * The completion scripts (in contrib/) did not know about quite a few
   options that are common between "git merge" and "git pull", and a
   couple of options unique to "git merge".

 * "--ignore-space-change" option of "git apply" ignored the spaces
   at the beginning of line too aggressively, which is inconsistent
   with the option of the same name "diff" and "git diff" have.

 * "git blame" miscounted number of columns needed to show localized
   timestamps, resulting in jaggy left-side-edge of the source code
   lines in its output.

 * "git blame" assigned the blame to the copy in the working-tree if
   the repository is set to core.autocrlf=input and the file used CRLF
   line endings.

 * "git commit --allow-empty-message -C $commit" did not work when the
   commit did not have any log message.

 * "git diff --find-copies-harder" sometimes pretended as if the mode
   bits have changed for paths that are marked with assume-unchanged
   bit.

 * "git format-patch" did not enforce the rule that the "--follow"
   option from the log/diff family of commands must be used with
   exactly one pathspec.

 * "git gc --auto" was recently changed to run in the background to
   give control back early to the end-user sitting in front of the
   terminal, but it forgot that housekeeping involving reflogs should
   be done without other processes competing for accesses to the refs.

 * "git grep -O" to show the lines that hit in the pager did not work
   well with case insensitive search.  We now spawn "less" with its
   "-I" option when it is used as the pager (which is the default).

 * We used to disable threaded "git index-pack" on platforms without
   thread-safe pread(); use a different workaround for such
   platforms to allow threaded "git index-pack".

 * The error reporting from "git index-pack" has been improved to
   distinguish missing objects from type errors.

 * "git mailinfo" used to read beyond the end of header string while
   parsing an incoming e-mail message to extract the patch.

 * On a case insensitive filesystem, merge-recursive incorrectly
   deleted the file that is to be renamed to a name that is the same
   except for case differences.

 * "git pack-objects" unnecessarily copied the previous contents when
   extending the hashtable, even though it will populate the table
   from scratch anyway.

 * "git rerere forget" did not work well when merge.conflictstyle
   was set to a non-default value.

 * "git remote rm" and "git remote prune" can involve removing many
   refs at once, which is not a very efficient thing to do when very
   many refs exist in the packed-refs file.

 * "git log --exclude=<glob> --all | git shortlog" worked as expected,
   but "git shortlog --exclude=<glob> --all", which is supposed to be
   identical to the above pipeline, was not accepted at the command
   line argument parser level.

 * The autostash mode of "git rebase -i" did not restore the dirty
   working tree state if the user aborted the interactive rebase by
   emptying the insn sheet.

 * "git show -s" (i.e. show log message only) used to incorrectly emit
   an extra blank line after a merge commit.

 * "git status", even though it is a read-only operation, tries to
   update the index with refreshed lstat(2) info to optimize future
   accesses to the working tree opportunistically, but this could
   race with a "read-write" operation that modify the index while it
   is running.  Detect such a race and avoid overwriting the index.

 * "git status" (and "git commit") behaved as if changes in a modified
   submodule are not there if submodule.*.ignore configuration is set,
   which was misleading.  The configuration is only to unclutter diff
   output during the course of development, and should not to hide
   changes in the "status" output to cause the users forget to commit
   them.

 * The mode to run tests with HTTP server tests disabled was broken.

========================

 * Documentation for "git submodule sync" forgot to say that the subcommand
   can take the "--recursive" option.

 * Mishandling of patterns in .gitignore that has trailing SPs quoted
   with backslashes (e.g. ones that end with "\ ") have been
   corrected.

 * Recent updates to "git repack" started to duplicate objects that
   are in packfiles marked with .keep flag into the new packfile by
   mistake.

 * "git clone -b brefs/tags/bar" would have mistakenly thought we were
   following a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch,
   because it incorrectly used strstr().

 * "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier, but
   the parser did not notice it as garbage.

 * Code to avoid adding the same alternate object store twice was
   subtly broken for a long time, but nobody seems to have noticed.

 * A handful of code paths had to read the commit object more than
   once when showing header fields that are usually not parsed.  The
   internal data structure to keep track of the contents of the commit
   object has been updated to reduce the need for this double-reading,
   and to allow the caller find the length of the object.

 * During "git rebase --merge", a conflicted patch could not be
   skipped with "--skip" if the next one also conflicted.

========================

 * An ancient rewrite passed a wrong pointer to a curl library
   function in a rarely used code path.

 * "filter-branch" left an empty single-parent commit that results when
   all parents of a merge commit gets mapped to the same commit, even
   under "--prune-empty".

 * "log --show-signature" incorrectly decided the color to paint a
   mergetag that was and was not correctly validated.

 * "log --show-signature" did not pay attention to "--graph" option.

Also a lot of fixes to the tests and some updates to the docs are
included.

========================

Fixes since v2.0.4
------------------

 * We used to allow committing a path ".Git/config" with Git that is
   running on a case sensitive filesystem, but an attempt to check out
   such a path with Git that runs on a case insensitive filesystem
   would have clobbered ".git/config", which is definitely not what
   the user would have expected.  Git now prevents you from tracking
   a path with ".Git" (in any case combination) as a path component.

 * On Windows, certain path components that are different from ".git"
   are mapped to ".git", e.g. "git~1/config" is treated as if it were
   ".git/config".  HFS+ has a similar issue, where certain unicode
   codepoints are ignored, e.g. ".g\u200cit/config" is treated as if
   it were ".git/config".  Pathnames with these potential issues are
   rejected on the affected systems.  Git on systems that are not
   affected by this issue (e.g. Linux) can also be configured to
   reject them to ensure cross platform interoperability of the hosted
   projects.

 * "git fsck" notices a tree object that records such a path that can
   be confused with ".git", and with receive.fsckObjects configuration
   set to true, an attempt to "git push" such a tree object will be
   rejected.  Such a path may not be a problem on a well behaving
   filesystem but in order to protect those on HFS+ and on case
   insensitive filesystems, this check is enabled on all platforms.

A big "thanks!" for bringing this issue to us goes to our friends in
the Mercurial land, namely, Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

======================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

 * The default value we give to the environment variable LESS has been
   changed from "FRSX" to "FRX", losing "S" (chop long lines instead
   of wrapping).  Existing users who prefer not to see line-wrapped
   output may want to set

     $ git config core.pager "less -S"

   to restore the traditional behaviour.  It is expected that people
   find output from most subcommands easier to read with the new
   default, except for "blame" which tends to produce really long
   lines.  To override the new default only for "git blame", you can
   do this:

     $ git config pager.blame "less -S"

 * A few disused directories in contrib/ have been retired.


Updates since v2.0
------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Since the very beginning of Git, we gave the LESS environment a
   default value "FRSX" when we spawn "less" as the pager.  "S" (chop
   long lines instead of wrapping) has been removed from this default
   set of options, because it is more or less a personal taste thing,
   as opposed to the others that have good justifications (i.e. "R" is
   very much justified because many kinds of output we produce are
   colored and "FX" is justified because output we produce is often
   shorter than a page).

 * The logic and data used to compute the display width needed for
   UTF-8 strings have been updated to match Unicode 7.0 better.

 * HTTP-based transports learned to better propagate the error messages from
   the webserver to the client coming over the HTTP transport.

 * The completion script for bash (in contrib/) has been updated to
   better handle aliases that define a complex sequence of commands.

 * The "core.preloadindex" configuration variable is enabled by default,
   allowing modern platforms to take advantage of their
   multiple cores.

 * "git clone" applies the "if cloning from a local disk, physically
   copy the repository using hardlinks, unless otherwise told not to with
   --no-local" optimization when the url.*.insteadOf mechanism rewrites a
   remote-repository "git clone $URL" into a
   clone from a local disk.

 * "git commit --date=<date>" option learned more
   timestamp formats, including "--date=now".

 * The `core.commentChar` configuration variable is used to specify a
   custom comment character (other than the default "#") for
   the commit message editor.  This can be set to `auto` to attempt to
   choose a different character that does not conflict with any that
   already starts a line in the message being edited, for cases like
   "git commit --amend".

 * "git format-patch" learned --signature-file=<file> to add the contents
   of a file as a signature to the mail message it produces.

 * "git grep" learned the grep.fullname configuration variable to force
   "--full-name" to be the default.  This may cause regressions for
   scripted users who do not expect this new behaviour.

 * "git imap-send" learned to ask the credential helper for auth
   material.

 * "git log" and friends now understand the value "auto" for the
   "log.decorate" configuration variable to enable the "--decorate"
   option automatically when the output is sent to tty.

 * "git merge" without an argument, even when there is an upstream
   defined for the current branch, refused to run until
   merge.defaultToUpstream is set to true.  Flip the default of that
   configuration variable to true.

 * "git mergetool" learned to drive the vimdiff3 backend.

 * mergetool.prompt used to default to 'true', always asking "do you
   really want to run the tool on this path?".  The default has been
   changed to 'false'.  However, the prompt will still appear if
   mergetool used its autodetection system to guess which tool to use.
   Users who explicitly specify or configure a tool will no longer see
   the prompt by default.

   Strictly speaking, this is a backward incompatible change and
   users need to explicitly set the variable to 'true' if they want
   to be prompted to confirm running the tool on each path.

 * "git replace" learned the "--edit" subcommand to create a
   replacement by editing an existing object.

 * "git replace" learned a "--graft" option to rewrite the parents of a
   commit.

 * "git send-email" learned "--to-cover" and "--cc-cover" options, to
   tell it to copy To: and Cc: headers found in the first input file
   when emitting later input files.

 * "git svn" learned to cope with malformed timestamps with only one
   digit in the hour part, e.g. 2014-01-07T5:01:02.048176Z, emitted
   by some broken subversion server implementations.

 * "git tag" when editing the tag message shows the name of the tag
   being edited as a comment in the editor.

 * "git tag" learned to pay attention to "tag.sort" configuration, to
   be used as the default sort order when no --sort=<value> option
   is given.

 * A new "git verify-commit" command, to check GPG signatures in signed
   commits, in a way similar to "git verify-tag" is used to check
   signed tags, was added.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * Build procedure for 'subtree' (in contrib/) has been cleaned up.

 * Support for the profile-feedback build, which has
   bit-rotted for quite a while, has been updated.

 * An experimental format to use two files (the base file and
   incremental changes relative to it) to represent the index has been
   introduced; this may reduce I/O cost of rewriting a large index
   when only small part of the working tree changes.

 * Effort to shrink the size of patches Windows folks maintain on top
   by upstreaming them continues.  More tests that are not applicable
   to the Windows environment are identified and either skipped or
   made more portable.

 * Eradication of "test $condition -a $condition" from our scripts
   continues.

 * The `core.deltabasecachelimit` used to default to 16 MiB , but this
   proved to be too small, and has been bumped to 96 MiB.

 * "git blame" has been optimized greatly by reorganising the data
   structure that is used to keep track of the work to be done.

 * "git diff" that compares 3-or-more trees (e.g. parents and the
   result of a merge) has been optimized.

 * The API to update/delete references are being converted to handle
   updates to multiple references in a transactional way.  As an
   example, "update-ref --stdin [-z]" has been updated to use this
   API.

 * skip_prefix() and strip_suffix() API functions are used a lot more
   widely throughout the codebase now.

 * Parts of the test scripts can be skipped by using a range notation,
   e.g. "sh t1234-test.sh --run='1-4 6 8-'" to omit test piece 5 and 7
   and run everything else.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.0
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.0 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * We used to unconditionally disable the pager in the pager process
   we spawn to feed out output, but that prevented people who want to
   run "less" within "less" from doing so.
   (merge c0459ca je/pager-do-not-recurse later to maint).

 * Tools that read diagnostic output in our standard error stream do
   not want to see terminal control sequence (e.g. erase-to-eol).
   Detect them by checking if the standard error stream is connected
   to a tty.
   (merge 38de156 mn/sideband-no-ansi later to maint).

 * Mishandling of patterns in .gitignore that have trailing SPs quoted
   with backslashes (e.g. ones that end with "\ ") has been
   corrected.
   (merge 97c1364be6b pb/trim-trailing-spaces later to maint).

 * Reworded the error message given upon a failure to open an existing
   loose object file due to e.g. permission issues; it was reported as
   the object being corrupt, but that is not quite true.
   (merge d6c8a05 jk/report-fail-to-read-objects-better later to maint).

 * "git log -2master" is a common typo that shows two commits starting
   from whichever random branch that is not 'master' that happens to
   be checked out currently.
   (merge e3fa568 jc/revision-dash-count-parsing later to maint).

 * Code to avoid adding the same alternate object store twice was
   subtly broken for a long time, but nobody seems to have noticed.
   (merge 80b4785 rs/fix-alt-odb-path-comparison later to maint).
   (merge 539e750 ek/alt-odb-entry-fix later to maint).

 * The "%<(10,trunc)%s" pretty format specifier in the log family of
   commands is used to truncate the string to a given length (e.g. 10
   in the example) with padding to column-align the output, but did
   not take into account that number of bytes and number of display
   columns are different.
   (merge 7d50987 as/pretty-truncate later to maint).

 * "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier, but
   the parser did not notice it as garbage.
   (merge 958b2eb jk/pretty-G-format-fixes later to maint).

 * A handful of code paths had to read the commit object more than
   once when showing header fields that are usually not parsed.  The
   internal data structure to keep track of the contents of the commit
   object has been updated to reduce the need for this double-reading,
   and to allow the caller find the length of the object.
   (merge 218aa3a jk/commit-buffer-length later to maint).

 * The "mailmap.file" configuration option did not support tilde
   expansion (i.e. ~user/path and ~/path).
   (merge 9352fd5 ow/config-mailmap-pathname later to maint).

 * The completion scripts (in contrib/) did not know about quite a few
   options that are common between "git merge" and "git pull", and a
   couple of options unique to "git merge".
   (merge 8fee872 jk/complete-merge-pull later to maint).

 * The unix-domain socket used by the sample credential cache daemon
   tried to unlink an existing stale one at a wrong path, if the path
   to the socket was given as an overlong path that does not fit in
   the sun_path member of the sockaddr_un structure.
   (merge 2869b3e rs/fix-unlink-unix-socket later to maint).

 * An ancient rewrite passed a wrong pointer to a curl library
   function in a rarely used code path.
   (merge 479eaa8 ah/fix-http-push later to maint).

 * "--ignore-space-change" option of "git apply" ignored the spaces
   at the beginning of lines too aggressively, which is inconsistent
   with the option of the same name that "diff" and "git diff" have.
   (merge 14d3bb4 jc/apply-ignore-whitespace later to maint).

 * "git blame" miscounted the number of columns needed to show localized
   timestamps, resulting in a jaggy left-side-edge for the source code
   lines in its output.
   (merge dd75553 jx/blame-align-relative-time later to maint).

 * "git blame" assigned the blame to the copy in the working-tree if
   the repository is set to core.autocrlf=input and the file used CRLF
   line endings.
   (merge 4d4813a bc/blame-crlf-test later to maint).

 * "git clone -b brefs/tags/bar" would have mistakenly thought we were
   following a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch,
   because it incorrectly used strstr().
   (merge 60a5f5f jc/fix-clone-single-starting-at-a-tag later to maint).

 * "git commit --allow-empty-message -C $commit" did not work when the
   commit did not have any log message.
   (merge 076cbd6 jk/commit-C-pick-empty later to maint).

 * "git diff --find-copies-harder" sometimes pretended as if the mode
   bits have changed for paths that are marked with the assume-unchanged
   bit.
   (merge 5304810 jk/diff-files-assume-unchanged later to maint).

 * "filter-branch" left an empty single-parent commit that results when
   all parents of a merge commit get mapped to the same commit, even
   under "--prune-empty".
   (merge 79bc4ef cb/filter-branch-prune-empty-degenerate-merges later to maint).

 * "git format-patch" did not enforce the rule that the "--follow"
   option from the log/diff family of commands must be used with
   exactly one pathspec.
   (merge dd63f16 jk/diff-follow-must-take-one-pathspec later to maint).

 * "git gc --auto" was recently changed to run in the background to
   give control back early to the end-user sitting in front of the
   terminal, but it forgot that housekeeping involving reflogs should
   be done without other processes competing for accesses to the refs.
   (merge 62aad18 nd/daemonize-gc later to maint).

 * "git grep -O" to show the lines that hit in the pager did not work
   well with case insensitive search.  We now spawn "less" with its
   "-I" option when it is used as the pager (which is the default).
   (merge f7febbe sk/spawn-less-case-insensitively-from-grep-O-i later to maint).

 * We used to disable threaded "git index-pack" on platforms without
   thread-safe pread(); use a different workaround for such
   platforms to allow threaded "git index-pack".
   (merge 3953949 nd/index-pack-one-fd-per-thread later to maint).

 * The error reporting from "git index-pack" has been improved to
   distinguish missing objects from type errors.
   (merge 77583e7 jk/index-pack-report-missing later to maint).

 * "log --show-signature" incorrectly decided the color to paint a
   mergetag that was and was not correctly validated.
   (merge 42c55ce mg/fix-log-mergetag-color later to maint).

 * "log --show-signature" did not pay attention to the "--graph" option.
   (merge cf3983d zk/log-graph-showsig later to maint).

 * "git mailinfo" used to read beyond the ends of header strings while
   parsing an incoming e-mail message to extract the patch.
   (merge b1a013d rs/mailinfo-header-cmp later to maint).

 * On a case insensitive filesystem, merge-recursive incorrectly
   deleted the file that is to be renamed to a name that is the same
   except for case differences.
   (merge baa37bf dt/merge-recursive-case-insensitive later to maint).

 * Merging changes into a file that ends in an incomplete line made the
   last line into a complete one, even when the other branch did not
   change anything around the end of file.
   (merge ba31180 mk/merge-incomplete-files later to maint).

 * "git pack-objects" unnecessarily copied the previous contents when
   extending the hashtable, even though it will populate the table
   from scratch anyway.
   (merge fb79947 rs/pack-objects-no-unnecessary-realloc later to maint).

 * Recent updates to "git repack" started to duplicate objects that
   are in packfiles marked with the .keep flag into the new packfile by
   mistake.
   (merge d078d85 jk/repack-pack-keep-objects later to maint).

 * "git rerere forget" did not work well when merge.conflictstyle
   was set to a non-default value.
   (merge de3d8bb fc/rerere-conflict-style later to maint).

 * "git remote rm" and "git remote prune" can involve removing many
   refs at once, which is not a very efficient thing to do when very
   many refs exist in the packed-refs file.
   (merge e6bea66 jl/remote-rm-prune later to maint).

 * "git log --exclude=<glob> --all | git shortlog" worked as expected,
   but "git shortlog --exclude=<glob> --all", which is supposed to be
   identical to the above pipeline, was not accepted at the command
   line argument parser level.
   (merge eb07774 jc/shortlog-ref-exclude later to maint).

 * The autostash mode of "git rebase -i" did not restore the dirty
   working tree state if the user aborted the interactive rebase by
   emptying the insn sheet.
   (merge ddb5432 rr/rebase-autostash-fix later to maint).

 * "git rebase --fork-point" did not filter out patch-identical
   commits correctly.

 * During "git rebase --merge", a conflicted patch could not be
   skipped with "--skip" if the next one also conflicted.
   (merge 95104c7 bc/fix-rebase-merge-skip later to maint).

 * "git show -s" (i.e. show log message only) used to incorrectly emit
   an extra blank line after a merge commit.
   (merge ad2f725 mk/show-s-no-extra-blank-line-for-merges later to maint).

 * "git status", even though it is a read-only operation, tries to
   update the index with refreshed lstat(2) info to optimize future
   accesses to the working tree opportunistically, but this could
   race with a "read-write" operation that modifies the index while it
   is running.  Detect such a race and avoid overwriting the index.
   (merge 426ddee ym/fix-opportunistic-index-update-race later to maint).

 * "git status" (and "git commit") behaved as if changes in a modified
   submodule are not there if submodule.*.ignore configuration is set,
   which was misleading.  The configuration is only to unclutter diff
   output during the course of development, and not to hide
   changes in the "status" output to cause the users forget to commit
   them.
   (merge c215d3d jl/status-added-submodule-is-never-ignored later to maint).

 * Documentation for "git submodule sync" forgot to say that the subcommand
   can take the "--recursive" option.
   (merge 9393ae7 mc/doc-submodule-sync-recurse later to maint).

 * "git update-index --cacheinfo" in 2.0 release crashed on a
   malformed command line.
   (merge c8e1ee4 jc/rev-parse-argh-dashed-multi-words later to maint).

 * The mode to run tests with HTTP server tests disabled was broken.
   (merge afa53fe na/no-http-test-in-the-middle later to maint).

========================

 * Git 2.0 had a regression where "git fetch" into a shallowly
   cloned repository from a repository with bitmap object index
   enabled did not work correctly.  This has been corrected.

 * Git 2.0 had a regression which broke (rarely used) "git diff-tree
   -t".  This has been corrected.

 * "git log --pretty/format=" with an empty format string did not
   mean the more obvious "No output whatsoever" but "Use default
   format", which was counterintuitive.  Now it means "nothing shown
   for the log message part".

 * "git -c section.var command" and "git -c section.var= command"
   should pass the configuration differently (the former should be a
   boolean true, the latter should be an empty string), but they
   didn't work that way.  Now it does.

 * Applying a patch not generated by Git in a subdirectory used to
   check the whitespace breakage using the attributes for incorrect
   paths. Also whitespace checks were performed even for paths
   excluded via "git apply --exclude=<path>" mechanism.

 * "git bundle create" with date-range specification were meant to
   exclude tags outside the range, but it did not work correctly.

 * "git add x" where x that used to be a directory has become a
   symbolic link to a directory misbehaved.

 * The prompt script checked $GIT_DIR/ref/stash file to see if there
   is a stash, which was a no-no.

 * "git checkout -m" did not switch to another branch while carrying
   the local changes forward when a path was deleted from the index.

 * With sufficiently long refnames, fast-import could have overflown
   an on-stack buffer.

 * After "pack-refs --prune" packed refs at the top-level, it failed
   to prune them.

 * "git gc --auto" triggered from "git fetch --quiet" was not quiet.

========================

 * "git push" over HTTP transport had an artificial limit on number of
   refs that can be pushed imposed by the command line length.

 * When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same object
   twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.

 * An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "git fast-import" input
   stream caused it to misbehave.

 * Reachability check (used in "git prune" and friends) did not add a
   detached HEAD as a starting point to traverse objects still in use.

 * "git config --add section.var val" used to lose existing
   section.var whose value was an empty string.

 * "git fsck" failed to report that it found corrupt objects via its
   exit status in some cases.

========================

 * Some MUAs mangled a line in a message that begins with "From " to
   ">From " when writing to a mailbox file and feeding such an input to
   "git am" used to lose such a line.

 * "git daemon" (with NO_IPV6 build configuration) used to incorrectly
   use the hostname even when gethostbyname() reported that the given
   hostname is not found.

 * Newer versions of 'meld' breaks the auto-detection we use to see if
   they are new enough to support the `--output` option.

 * "git pack-objects" forgot to disable the codepath to generate
   object recheability bitmap when it needs to split the resulting
   pack.

 * "gitweb" used deprecated CGI::startfrom, which was removed from
   CGI.pm as of 4.04; use CGI::start_from instead.

 * "git log" documentation had an example section marked up not
   quite correctly, which passed AsciiDoc but failed with
   AsciiDoctor.

Also contains some documentation updates.

========================

Fixes since v2.1.3
------------------

 * We used to allow committing a path ".Git/config" with Git that is
   running on a case sensitive filesystem, but an attempt to check out
   such a path with Git that runs on a case insensitive filesystem
   would have clobbered ".git/config", which is definitely not what
   the user would have expected.  Git now prevents you from tracking
   a path with ".Git" (in any case combination) as a path component.

 * On Windows, certain path components that are different from ".git"
   are mapped to ".git", e.g. "git~1/config" is treated as if it were
   ".git/config".  HFS+ has a similar issue, where certain unicode
   codepoints are ignored, e.g. ".g\u200cit/config" is treated as if
   it were ".git/config".  Pathnames with these potential issues are
   rejected on the affected systems.  Git on systems that are not
   affected by this issue (e.g. Linux) can also be configured to
   reject them to ensure cross platform interoperability of the hosted
   projects.

 * "git fsck" notices a tree object that records such a path that can
   be confused with ".git", and with receive.fsckObjects configuration
   set to true, an attempt to "git push" such a tree object will be
   rejected.  Such a path may not be a problem on a well behaving
   filesystem but in order to protect those on HFS+ and on case
   insensitive filesystems, this check is enabled on all platforms.

A big "thanks!" for bringing this issue to us goes to our friends in
the Mercurial land, namely, Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.

Although these pieces are available as part of the official git
source tree, they are in somewhat different status.  The
intention is to keep interesting tools around git here, maybe
even experimental ones, to give users an easier access to them,
and to give tools wider exposure, so that they can be improved
faster.

I am not expecting to touch these myself that much.  As far as
my day-to-day operation is concerned, these subdirectories are
owned by their respective primary authors.  I am willing to help
if users of these components and the contrib/ subtree "owners"
have technical/design issues to resolve, but the initiative to
fix and/or enhance things _must_ be on the side of the subtree
owners.  IOW, I won't be actively looking for bugs and rooms for
enhancements in them as the git maintainer -- I may only do so
just as one of the users when I want to scratch my own itch.  If
you have patches to things in contrib/ area, the patch should be
first sent to the primary author, and then the primary author
should ack and forward it to me (git pull request is nicer).
This is the same way as how I have been treating gitk, and to a
lesser degree various foreign SCM interfaces, so you know the
drill.

I expect that things that start their life in the contrib/ area
to graduate out of contrib/ once they mature, either by becoming
projects on their own, or moving to the toplevel directory.  On
the other hand, I expect I'll be proposing removal of disused
and inactive ones from time to time.

If you have new things to add to this area, please first propose
it on the git mailing list, and after a list discussion proves
there are some general interests (it does not have to be a
list-wide consensus for a tool targeted to a relatively narrow
audience -- for example I do not work with projects whose
upstream is svn, so I have no use for git-svn myself, but it is
of general interest for people who need to interoperate with SVN
repositories in a way git-svn works better than git-svnimport),
submit a patch to create a subdirectory of contrib/ and put your
stuff there.

# Generate buildsystem files
#
# This script generate buildsystem files based on the output of a
# GNU Make --dry-run, enabling Windows users to develop Git with their
# trusted IDE with native projects.
#
# Note:
# It is not meant as *the* way of building Git with MSVC, but merely a
# convenience. The correct way of building Git with MSVC is to use the
# GNU Make tool to build with the maintained Makefile in the root of
# the project. If you have the msysgit environment installed and
# available in your current console, together with the Visual Studio
# environment you wish to build for, all you have to do is run the
# command:
#     make MSVC=1

NAME
----
git-contacts - List people who might be interested in a set of changes


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git contacts' (<patch>|<range>|<rev>)...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Given a set of changes, specified as patch files or revisions, determine people
who might be interested in those changes.  This is done by consulting the
history of each patch or revision hunk to find people mentioned by commits
which touched the lines of files under consideration.

Input consists of one or more patch files or revision arguments.  A revision
argument can be a range or a single `<rev>` which is interpreted as
`<rev>..HEAD`, thus the same revision arguments are accepted as for
linkgit:git-format-patch[1]. Patch files and revision arguments can be combined
in the same invocation.

This command can be useful for determining the list of people with whom to
discuss proposed changes, or for finding the list of recipients to Cc: when
submitting a patch series via `git send-email`. For the latter case, `git
contacts` can be used as the argument to `git send-email`'s `--cc-cmd` option.


DISCUSSION
----------

`git blame` is invoked for each hunk in a patch file or revision.  For each
commit mentioned by `git blame`, the commit message is consulted for people who
authored, reviewed, signed, acknowledged, or were Cc:'d.  Once the list of
participants is known, each person's relevance is computed by considering how
many commits mentioned that person compared with the total number of commits
under consideration.  The final output consists only of participants who exceed
a minimum threshold of participation.


OUTPUT
------

For each person of interest, a single line is output, terminated by a newline.
If the person's name is known, ``Name $$<user@host>$$'' is printed; otherwise
only ``$$<user@host>$$'' is printed.


EXAMPLES
--------

* Consult patch files:
+
------------
$ git contacts feature/*.patch
------------

* Revision range:
+
------------
$ git contacts R1..R2
------------

* From a single revision to `HEAD`:
+
------------
$ git contacts origin
------------

* Helper for `git send-email`:
+
------------
$ git send-email --cc-cmd='git contacts' feature/*.patch
------------


LIMITATIONS
-----------

Several conditions controlling a person's significance are currently
hard-coded, such as minimum participation level (10%), blame date-limiting (5
years), and `-C` level for detecting moved and copied lines (a single `-C`). In
the future, these conditions may become configurable.

Version $VERSION by tzz\@lifelogs.com.  License: BSD.

Options:

  -f|--file AUTHFILE : specify netrc-style files.  Files with the .gpg extension
                       will be decrypted by GPG before parsing.  Multiple -f
                       arguments are OK.  They are processed in order, and the
                       first matching entry found is returned via the credential
                       helper protocol (see below).

                       When no -f option is given, .authinfo.gpg, .netrc.gpg,
		       .authinfo, and .netrc files in your home directory are used
		       in this order.

  -k|--insecure      : ignore bad file ownership or permissions

  -d|--debug         : turn on debugging (developer info)

  -v|--verbose       : be more verbose (show files and information found)

To enable this credential helper:

  git config credential.helper '$shortname -f AUTHFILE1 -f AUTHFILE2'

(Note that Git will prepend "git-credential-" to the helper name and look for it
in the path.)

...and if you want lots of debugging info:

  git config credential.helper '$shortname -f AUTHFILE -d'

...or to see the files opened and data found:

  git config credential.helper '$shortname -f AUTHFILE -v'

Only "get" mode is supported by this credential helper.  It opens every AUTHFILE
and looks for the first entry that matches the requested search criteria:

 'port|protocol':
   The protocol that will be used (e.g., https). (protocol=X)

 'machine|host':
   The remote hostname for a network credential. (host=X)

 'path':
   The path with which the credential will be used. (path=X)

 'login|user|username':
   The credentials username, if we already have one. (username=X)

Thus, when we get this query on STDIN:

host=github.com
protocol=https
username=tzz

this credential helper will look for the first entry in every AUTHFILE that
matches

machine github.com port https login tzz

OR

machine github.com protocol https login tzz

OR... etc. acceptable tokens as listed above.  Any unknown tokens are
simply ignored.

Then, the helper will print out whatever tokens it got from the entry, including
"password" tokens, mapping back to Git's helper protocol; e.g. "port" is mapped
back to "protocol".  Any redundant entry tokens (part of the original query) are
skipped.

Again, note that only the first matching entry from all the AUTHFILEs, processed
in the sequence given on the command line, is used.

Netrc/authinfo tokens can be quoted as 'STRING' or "STRING".

No caching is performed by this credential helper.

==============

Line oriented diffs are great for reviewing code, because for most
hunks, you want to see the old and the new segments of code next to each
other. Sometimes, though, when an old line and a new line are very
similar, it's hard to immediately see the difference.

You can use "--color-words" to highlight only the changed portions of
lines. However, this can often be hard to read for code, as it loses
the line structure, and you end up with oddly formatted bits.

Instead, this script post-processes the line-oriented diff, finds pairs
of lines, and highlights the differing segments.  It's currently very
simple and stupid about doing these tasks. In particular:

  1. It will only highlight hunks in which the number of removed and
     added lines is the same, and it will pair lines within the hunk by
     position (so the first removed line is compared to the first added
     line, and so forth). This is simple and tends to work well in
     practice. More complex changes don't highlight well, so we tend to
     exclude them due to the "same number of removed and added lines"
     restriction. Or even if we do try to highlight them, they end up
     not highlighting because of our "don't highlight if the whole line
     would be highlighted" rule.

  2. It will find the common prefix and suffix of two lines, and
     consider everything in the middle to be "different". It could
     instead do a real diff of the characters between the two lines and
     find common subsequences. However, the point of the highlight is to
     call attention to a certain area. Even if some small subset of the
     highlighted area actually didn't change, that's OK. In practice it
     ends up being more readable to just have a single blob on the line
     showing the interesting bit.

The goal of the script is therefore not to be exact about highlighting
changes, but to call attention to areas of interest without being
visually distracting.  Non-diff lines and existing diff coloration is
preserved; the intent is that the output should look exactly the same as
the input, except for the occasional highlight.

Use
---

You can try out the diff-highlight program with:

---------------------------------------------
git log -p --color | /path/to/diff-highlight
---------------------------------------------

If you want to use it all the time, drop it in your $PATH and put the
following in your git configuration:

---------------------------------------------
[pager]
	log = diff-highlight | less
	show = diff-highlight | less
	diff = diff-highlight | less
---------------------------------------------

Bugs
----

Because diff-highlight relies on heuristics to guess which parts of
changes are important, there are some cases where the highlighting is
more distracting than useful. Fortunately, these cases are rare in
practice, and when they do occur, the worst case is simply a little
extra highlighting. This section documents some cases known to be
sub-optimal, in case somebody feels like working on improving the
heuristics.

1. Two changes on the same line get highlighted in a blob. For example,
   highlighting:

----------------------------------------------
-foo(buf, size);
+foo(obj->buf, obj->size);
----------------------------------------------

   yields (where the inside of "+{}" would be highlighted):

----------------------------------------------
-foo(buf, size);
+foo(+{obj->buf, obj->}size);
----------------------------------------------

   whereas a more semantically meaningful output would be:

----------------------------------------------
-foo(buf, size);
+foo(+{obj->}buf, +{obj->}size);
----------------------------------------------

   Note that doing this right would probably involve a set of
   content-specific boundary patterns, similar to word-diff. Otherwise
   you get junk like:

-----------------------------------------------------
-this line has some -{i}nt-{ere}sti-{ng} text on it
+this line has some +{fa}nt+{a}sti+{c} text on it
-----------------------------------------------------

   which is less readable than the current output.

2. The multi-line matching assumes that lines in the pre- and post-image
   match by position. This is often the case, but can be fooled when a
   line is removed from the top and a new one added at the bottom (or
   vice versa). Unless the lines in the middle are also changed, diffs
   will show this as two hunks, and it will not get highlighted at all
   (which is good). But if the lines in the middle are changed, the
   highlighting can be misleading. Here's a pathological case:

-----------------------------------------------------
-one
-two
-three
-four
+two 2
+three 3
+four 4
+five 5
-----------------------------------------------------

   which gets highlighted as:

-----------------------------------------------------
-one
-t-{wo}
-three
-f-{our}
+two 2
+t+{hree 3}
+four 4
+f+{ive 5}
-----------------------------------------------------

   because it matches "two" to "three 3", and so forth. It would be
   nicer as:

-----------------------------------------------------
-one
-two
-three
-four
+two +{2}
+three +{3}
+four +{4}
+five 5
-----------------------------------------------------

   which would probably involve pre-matching the lines into pairs
   according to some heuristic.
