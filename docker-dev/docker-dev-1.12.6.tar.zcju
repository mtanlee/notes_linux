/* This class lets an application manually drive the rendering of a
 * layer tree into an OpenGL rendering context. This is _not_ the
 * best solution for real-time output, use an NSView to host a layer
 * tree for that.
 *
 * The contract between CARenderer and the provided OpenGL context is
 * as follows:
 *
 * 1. the context should have an orthographic projection matrix and an
 *    identity model-view matrix, such that vertex position (0,0) is in
 *    the bottom left corner. (That is, window coordinates must match
 *    vertex coordinates.)
 *
 *    Sample code to initialize the OpenGL context for a window of width
 *    W and height H could be:
 *
 *      glViewport (0, 0, W, H);
 *      glMatrixMode (GL_PROJECTION);
 *      glLoadIdentity ();
 *      glOrtho (0, W, 0, H, -1, 1);
 *
 * 2. all OpenGL state apart from the viewport and projection matrices
 *    must have their default values when -render is called. On return
 *    from the -render method, the default values will be preserved.

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the preferences of an image decompressor for the chunking

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    If you are writing image data to a container, you can optimize
 *    the subsequent loading of the image data for playback and other
 *    operations by chunking multiple samples of image data together.
 *    This function can be called to determine whether an image

 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    ci:

 *    
 *    desc:
 *      The image description for the image data to be chunked.

 *    alignment:
 *      Points to a variable to receive the preferred boundary for
 *      chunk alignment in bytes, e.g. 512. It is not safe to pass NULL

 *  ImageCodecEncodeFrame()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Presents the compressor with a frame to encode.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The compressor may encode the frame immediately or queue it for
 *    later encoding. If the compressor queues the frame for later
 *    decode, it must retain it (by calling
 *    ICMCompressorSourceFrameRetain) and release it when it is done
 *    with it (by calling ICMCompressorSourceFrameRelease). 
 *    Pixel buffers are guaranteed to conform to the pixel buffer
 *    attributes returned by ImageCodecPrepareToCompressFrames. 
 *     During multipass encoding, if the compressor requested the
 *    kICMCompressionPassMode_NoSourceFrames flag, the source frame
 *    pixel buffers may be NULL. 
 *    (Note: this replaces ImageCodecBandCompress.)

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The session will retain the pixel buffer as long as necessary;
 *    the client should not modify the pixel data until the session
 *    releases it. (The most practical way to deal with this is by
 *    allocating pixel buffers from a pool.) 
 *    The client may fill in both, either or neither of
 *    displayTimeStamp and displayDuration, but should set the
 *    appropriate flags to indicate which is valid. If the client needs
 *    to track the progress of a source frame, it should provide a
 *    sourceTrackingCallback. 
 *    Note: If multipass compression is enabled, calls to
 *    ICMCompressionSessionEncodeFrame must be bracketed by
 *    ICMCompressionSessionBeginPass ... ICMCompressionSessionEndPass.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    session:
 *      Identifies the compression session.
 *    
 *    pixelBuffer:
 *      Contains the source image to be compressed. PixelBuffer must
 *      have a nonzero reference count. The session will retain it as
 *      long as necessary. The client should not modify pixel buffer's
 *      pixels until the pixel buffer release callback is called. In a
 *      multipass encoding session pass where the compressor suggested
 *      the flag kICMCompressionPassMode_NoSourceFrames, you may pass
 *      NULL for pixelBuffer.
 *    
 *    displayTimeStamp:
 *      The display timestamp of the frame, using the timescale passed
 *      to ICMCompressionSessionCreate. If you pass a valid value, set
 *      the kICMValidTime_DisplayTimeStampIsValid flag in
 *      validTimeFlags.

 *    
 *    validTimeFlags:
 *      Flags to indicate which of displayTimeStamp and displayDuration
 *      are valid.
 *    
 *    frameOptions:

 *  Discussion:

 *    or output frames at a different frame rate from the original.
 *    This feature is controlled by the "allow frame time changes"

 *    compressors to emit one encoded frame for every source frame, and
 *    to preserve frame display times. 
 *    (Note: this feature replaces the practice of having compressors
 *    return special high similarity values to indicate that frames
 *    could be dropped.) 
 *    If you want to allow the compressor to modify frame times in
 *    order to improve compression performance, enable frame time
 *    changes.
