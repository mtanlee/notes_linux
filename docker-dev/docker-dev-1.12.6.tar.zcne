completes only logged\-on users after `\fBtalk\fP\&'\&.  Note that `\fBwhoson\fP' must
return an array, so `\fBreply=`users`\fP\&' would be incorrect\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-H\fP \fInum pattern\fP
The possible completions are taken from the last \fInum\fP history
lines\&.  Only words matching \fIpattern\fP are taken\&.  If \fInum\fP is
zero or negative the whole history is searched and if \fIpattern\fP is
the empty string all words are taken (as with `\fB*\fP\&')\&.  A typical
use is
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-D \-f + \-H 0 \&''\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
which forces completion to look back in the history list for a word if
no filename matches\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Control Flags"
These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but
manipulate the options that do:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-Q\fP
This instructs the shell not to quote any metacharacters in the possible
completions\&.  Normally the results of a completion are inserted into
the command line with any metacharacters quoted so that they are
interpreted as normal characters\&.  This is appropriate for filenames
and ordinary strings\&.  However, for special effects, such as inserting
a backquoted expression from a completion array (\fB\-k\fP) so that
the expression will not be evaluated until the complete line is
executed, this option must be used\&.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP \fIprefix\fP
The \fIprefix\fP is inserted just before the completed string; any
initial part already typed will be completed and the whole \fIprefix\fP
ignored for completion purposes\&.  For example,
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-j \-P "%" kill\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
inserts a `%\&' after the kill command and then completes job names\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIsuffix\fP
When a completion is found the \fIsuffix\fP is inserted after
the completed string\&.  In the case of menu completion the suffix is
inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle through the
list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key\&.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP \fIfile\-prefix\fP
With directory \fIfile\-prefix\fP:  for command, file, directory and
globbing completion (options \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-/\fP, \fB\-g\fP), the file
prefix is implicitly added in front of the completion\&.  For example,
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-/ \-W ~/Mail maildirs\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory
\fB~/Mail\fP, although that prefix does not appear on the command line\&.
The \fIfile\-prefix\fP may also be of the form accepted by the \fB\-k\fP
flag, i\&.e\&. the name of an array or a literal list in parenthesis\&. In
this case all the directories in the list will be searched for
possible completions\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
If used with a suffix as specified by the \fB\-S\fP option, this
causes the suffix to be removed if the next character typed is a blank
or does not insert anything or if the suffix consists of only one character
and the next character typed is the same character; this the same rule used
for the \fBAUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\fP option\&.  The option is most useful for list
separators (comma, colon, etc\&.)\&.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIcmd\fP
This option restricts the range
of command line words that are considered to be arguments\&.  If
combined with one of the extended completion patterns `\fBp[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP\&',
`\fBr[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP\&', or `\fBR[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP'  (see the section `Extended Completion'
below) the range is restricted to the range of arguments
specified in the brackets\&.  Completion is then performed as if these
had been given as arguments to the \fIcmd\fP supplied with the
option\&. If the \fIcmd\fP string is empty the first word in the range
is instead taken as the command name, and command name completion
performed on the first word in the range\&.  For example,
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-x \&'r[\-exec,;]' \-l '' \-\- find\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
completes arguments between `\fB\-exec\fP\&' and the following `\fB;\fP' (or the end
of the command line if there is no such string) as if they were
a separate command line\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-h\fP \fIcmd\fP
Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole\&. With this option,
completion can be done separately on different parts of such
strings\&. It works like the \fB\-l\fP option but makes the completion code 
work on the parts of the current word that are separated by
spaces\&. These parts are completed as if they were arguments to the
given \fIcmd\fP\&. If \fIcmd\fP is the empty string, the first part is
completed as a command name, as with \fB\-l\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP
Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not they
actually match the word on the command line\&.  The word typed so far
will be deleted\&.  This is most useful with a function (given by the
\fB\-K\fP option) which can examine the word components passed to it
(or via the \fBread\fP builtin\&'s \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-l\fP flags) and
use its own criteria to decide what matches\&.  If there is no
completion, the original word is retained\&.  Since the produced 
possible completions seldom have interesting common prefixes
and suffixes, menu completion is started immediately if \fBAUTO_MENU\fP is
set and this flag is used\&.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP \fIfunc\-or\-var\fP
The list provided by \fIfunc\-or\-var\fP is displayed instead of the list
of completions whenever a listing is required; the actual completions
to be inserted are not affected\&.  It can be provided in two
ways\&. Firstly, if \fIfunc\-or\-var\fP begins with a \fB$\fP it defines a
variable, or if it begins with a left parenthesis a literal
array, which contains the list\&.  A variable may have been set by a
call to a function using the \fB\-K\fP option\&.  Otherwise it contains the
name of a function which will be executed to create the list\&.  The
function will be passed as an argument list all matching completions,
including prefixes and suffixes expanded in full, and should set the
array \fBreply\fP to the result\&.  In both cases, the display list will
only be retrieved after a complete list of matches has been created\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in
length, to the original set of matches, and may be passed as a scalar
instead of an array\&.  No special formatting of characters is
performed on the output in this case; in particular, newlines are
printed literally and if they appear output in columns is suppressed\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-X\fP \fIexplanation\fP
Print \fIexplanation\fP when trying completion on the current set of
options\&. A `\fB%n\fP\&' in this string is replaced by the number of
matches that were added for this explanation string\&.
The explanation only appears if completion was tried and there was
no unique match, or when listing completions\&. Explanation strings 
will be listed together with the matches of the group specified
together with the \fB\-X\fP option (using the \fB\-J\fP or \fB\-V\fP
option)\&. If the same explanation string is given to multiple \fB\-X\fP
options, the string appears only once (for each group) and the number
of matches shown for the `\fB%n\fP\&' is the total number of all matches
for each of these uses\&. In any case, the explanation string will only
be shown if there was at least one match added for the explanation
string\&.
.RS
.PP
The sequences \fB%B\fP, \fB%b\fP, \fB%S\fP, \fB%s\fP, \fB%U\fP, and \fB%u\fP specify
output attributes (bold, standout, and underline), \fB%F\fP, \fB%f\fP, \fB%K\fP,
\fB%k\fP specify foreground and background colours, and \fB%{\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB%}\fP can

.RE
.TP
\fB\-Y\fP \fIexplanation\fP
Identical to \fB\-X\fP, except that the \fIexplanation\fP first undergoes
expansion following the usual rules for strings in double quotes\&.
The expansion will be carried out after any functions are called for
the \fB\-K\fP or \fB\-y\fP options, allowing them to set variables\&.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIcontinue\fP
The \fIcontinue\fP\-string contains a character that specifies which set
of completion flags should be used next\&.  It is useful:
.RS
.PP
(i) With \fB\-T\fP, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when
\fBcompctl\fP would usually continue with ordinary processing after
finding matches; this can be suppressed with `\fB\-tn\fP\&'\&.
.PP
(ii) With a list of alternatives separated by \fB+\fP, when \fBcompctl\fP
would normally stop when one of the alternatives generates matches\&.  It
can be forced to consider the next set of completions by adding `\fB\-t+\fP\&'
to the flags of the alternative before the `\fB+\fP\&'\&.
.PP
(iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when \fBcompctl\fP would
normally continue until a set of conditions succeeded, then use only
the immediately following flags\&.  With `\fB\-t\-\fP\&', \fBcompctl\fP will
continue trying extended completions after the next `\fB\-\fP\&'; with
`\fB\-tx\fP\&' it will attempt completion with the default flags, in other
words those before the `\fB\-x\fP\&'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-J\fP \fIname\fP
This gives the name of the group the matches should be placed in\&. Groups
are listed and sorted separately; likewise, menu completion will offer
the matches in the groups in the order in which the groups were
defined\&. If no group name is explicitly given, the matches are stored in
a group named \fBdefault\fP\&. The first time a group name is encountered,
a group with that name is created\&. After that all matches with the same
group name are stored in that group\&.
.RS
.PP
This can be useful with non\-exclusive alternative completions\&.  For
example, in
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-f \-J files \-t+ + \-v \-J variables foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
both files and variables are possible completions, as the \fB\-t+\fP forces
both sets of alternatives before and after the \fB+\fP to be considered at
once\&.  Because of the \fB\-J\fP options, however, all files are listed
before all variables\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-V\fP \fIname\fP
Like \fB\-J\fP, but matches within the group will not be sorted in listings
nor in menu completion\&. These unsorted groups are in a different name
space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as \fB\-J files\fP and \fB\-V
files\fP are distinct\&.
.TP
\fB\-1\fP
If given together with the \fB\-V\fP option, makes

.\" Yodl file: Zsh/compsys.yo
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This describes the shell code for the `new\&' completion system, referred
to as \fBcompsys\fP\&.  It is written in shell functions based on the
features described in
\fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion is
started\&.  Many completions are already provided\&.
For this reason, a user can perform a great many tasks without
knowing any details beyond how to initialize the system, which is
described
below in INITIALIZATION\&.
.PP
The context that decides what completion is to be performed may be
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
an argument or option position: these describe the position on the
command line at which completion is requested\&.  For example `first argument
to rmdir, the word being completed names a directory\&';

.TP
\(bu
a special context, denoting an element in the shell\&'s syntax\&.  For example
`a word in command position\&' or `an array subscript'\&.

.PP
A full context specification contains other elements, as we shall describe\&.
.PP
Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs two more
concepts, \fIstyles\fP and \fItags\fP\&.  These provide ways for the user
to configure the system\&'s behaviour\&.
.PP
Tags play a dual role\&.  They serve as a classification system for
the matches, typically indicating a class of object that the user
may need to distinguish\&.  For example, when completing arguments of the
\fBls\fP command the user may prefer to try \fBfiles\fP before \fBdirectories\fP,
so both of these are tags\&.  They also appear as the rightmost
element in a context specification\&.
.PP
Styles modify various operations of the completion system, such as
output formatting, but also what kinds of completers are used (and in
what order), or which tags are examined\&.  Styles may accept arguments
and are manipulated using the \fBzstyle\fP command described in
see \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.
.PP
In summary, tags describe \fIwhat\fP the completion objects are, and style
\fBhow\fP they are to be completed\&.  At various points of execution, the
completion system checks what styles and/or tags are defined for the
current context, and uses that to modify its behavior\&.  The full
description of context handling, which determines how tags and other
elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles, is described
below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\&.
.PP
When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is called;
see the description of \fB_main_complete\fP in the list of control functions
below\&. This dispatcher decides which function should
be called to produce the completions, and calls it\&. The result is
passed to one or more \fIcompleters\fP, functions that implement
individual completion strategies: simple completion, error correction,
completion with error correction, menu selection, etc\&.
.PP
More generally, the shell functions contained in the completion system are
of two types:
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
those beginning `\fBcomp\fP\&' are to be called directly; there are only
a few of these;

.TP
\(bu
those beginning `\fB_\fP\&' are called by the
completion code\&.  The shell functions of this set, which implement
completion behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are referred to
as `widgets\&'\&.  These proliferate as new completions are required\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "INITIALIZATION"
.PP
If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to
call the shell function \fBcompinit\fP from your initialization file; see the
next section\&.  However, the function \fBcompinstall\fP can be run by a user
to configure various aspects of the completion system\&.
.PP
Usually, \fBcompinstall\fP will insert code into \fB\&.zshrc\fP, although if
that is not writable it will save it in another file and tell you that
file\&'s location\&.  Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines
added to \fB\&.zshrc\fP are actually run; you may, for example, need to move
them to an earlier place in the file if \fB\&.zshrc\fP usually returns early\&.
So long as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at the
start and finish), you can rerun \fBcompinstall\fP and it will correctly
locate and modify these lines\&.  Note, however, that any code you add to
this section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun \fBcompinstall\fP,
although lines using the command `\fBzstyle\fP\&' should be gracefully handled\&.
.PP
The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run
\fB\&.zshrc\fP by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect
immediately\&.  However, if \fBcompinstall\fP has removed definitions, you will
need to restart the shell to see the changes\&.
.PP
To run \fBcompinstall\fP you will need to make sure it is in a directory
mentioned in your \fBfpath\fP parameter, which should already be the case if
zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove the
appropriate directories from \fBfpath\fP\&.  Then it must be autoloaded
(`\fBautoload \-U compinstall\fP\&' is recommended)\&.  You can abort the
installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your
\fB\&.zshrc\fP will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at the
end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation\&.
.PP
.SS "Use of compinit"
.PP
This section describes the use of \fBcompinit\fP to initialize completion for
the current session when called directly; if you have run
\fBcompinstall\fP it will be called automatically from your \fB\&.zshrc\fP\&.
.PP
To initialize the system, the function \fBcompinit\fP should be in a
directory mentioned in the \fBfpath\fP parameter, and should be autoloaded
(`\fBautoload \-U compinit\fP\&' is recommended), and then run simply as
`\fBcompinit\fP\&'\&.  This will define a
few utility functions, arrange for all the necessary shell functions to be
autoloaded, and will then re\-define all widgets that do completion to use the
new system\&.  If you use the \fBmenu\-select\fP widget, which is part of the
\fBzsh/complist\fP module, you should make sure that that module is loaded
before the call to \fBcompinit\fP so that that widget is also
re\-defined\&.  If completion styles (see below) are set up to perform
expansion as well as completion by default, and the TAB key is bound to
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP, \fBcompinit\fP will rebind it to \fBcomplete\-word\fP;
this is necessary to use the correct form of expansion\&.
.PP
Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still
bind keys to the old widgets by putting a `\fB\&.\fP\&' in front of the
widget name, e\&.g\&. `\fB\&.expand\-or\-complete\fP\&'\&.
.PP
To speed up the running of \fBcompinit\fP, it can be made to produce a dumped
configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is the
default, but can be turned off by calling \fBcompinit\fP with the
option \fB\-D\fP\&.  The dumped file is \fB\&.zcompdump\fP in the same
directory as the startup files (i\&.e\&. \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP or \fB$HOME\fP);
alternatively, an explicit file name can be given by `\fBcompinit \-d\fP
\fIdumpfile\fP\&'\&.  The next invocation of \fBcompinit\fP will read the dumped
file instead of performing a full initialization\&.
.PP
If the number of completion files changes, \fBcompinit\fP will recognise this
and produce a new dump file\&.  However, if the name of a function or the
arguments in the first line of a \fB#compdef\fP function (as described below)
change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that
\fBcompinit\fP will re\-create it the next time it is run\&.  The check
performed to see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving
the option \fB\-C\fP\&.  In this case the dump file will only be created if
there isn\&'t one already\&.
.PP
The dumping is actually done by another function, \fBcompdump\fP, but you
will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration
(e\&.g\&. using \fBcompdef\fP) and then want to dump the new one\&.  The name of
the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose\&.
.PP
If the parameter \fB_compdir\fP is set, \fBcompinit\fP uses it as a directory
where completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they are
not already in the function search path\&.
.PP
For security reasons \fBcompinit\fP also checks if the completion system
would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in
directories that are world\- or group\-writable or that are not owned by 
root or by the current user\&.  If such files or directories are found,
\fBcompinit\fP will ask if the completion system should really be used\&.  To
avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use the
option \fB\-u\fP, and to make \fBcompinit\fP silently ignore all insecure files
and directories use the option \fB\-i\fP\&.  This security check is skipped
entirely when the \fB\-C\fP option is given\&.
.PP
The security check can be retried at any time by running the function
\fBcompaudit\fP\&.  This is the same check used by \fBcompinit\fP, but when it
is executed directly any changes to \fBfpath\fP are made local to the
function so they do not persist\&.  The directories to be checked may be
passed as arguments; if none are given, \fBcompaudit\fP uses \fBfpath\fP and
\fB_compdir\fP to find completion system directories, adding missing ones
to \fBfpath\fP as necessary\&.  To force a check of exactly the directories
currently named in \fBfpath\fP, set \fB_compdir\fP to an empty string before
calling \fBcompaudit\fP or \fBcompinit\fP\&.
.PP
The function \fBbashcompinit\fP provides compatibility with bash\&'s programmable
completion system\&.  When run it will define the functions, \fBcompgen\fP and
\fBcomplete\fP which correspond to the bash builtins with the same names\&.
It will then be possible to use completion specifications and functions
written for bash\&.
.PP
.SS "Autoloaded files"
.PP
The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they
start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the \fBfpath/FPATH\fP
parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored\&.  If \fBzsh\fP
was properly installed on your system, then \fBfpath/FPATH\fP automatically
contains the required directories for the standard functions\&.
.PP
For incomplete installations, if \fBcompinit\fP does not find enough files
beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it
will try to find more by adding the directory \fB_compdir\fP to the search
path\&.  If that directory has a subdirectory named \fBBase\fP, all
subdirectories will be added to the path\&.  Furthermore, if the subdirectory
\fBBase\fP has a subdirectory named \fBCore\fP, \fBcompinit\fP will add all
subdirectories of the subdirectories to the path: this allows
the functions to be in the same format as in the \fBzsh\fP source
distribution\&.
.PP
When \fBcompinit\fP is run, it searches all such files accessible via
\fBfpath/FPATH\fP and reads the first line of each of them\&.  This line should
contain one of the tags described below\&.  Files whose first line does not
start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the
completion system and will not be treated specially\&.
.PP
The tags are:

\fB#compdef\fP \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. [ \fB\-\fP{\fBp\fP|\fBP\fP} \fIpattern\fP \&.\&.\&. [ \fB\-N\fP \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. ] ]
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined 
in it will be called when completing \fIname\fPs, each of which is
either the name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one of
a number of special contexts in the form \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP described
below\&.
.RS
.PP
Each \fIname\fP may also be of the form `\fIcmd\fP\fB=\fP\fIservice\fP\&'\&.
When completing the command \fIcmd\fP, the function typically behaves as
if the command (or special context) \fIservice\fP was being completed
instead\&.  This provides a way of altering the behaviour of functions
that can perform many different completions\&.  It is implemented
by setting the parameter \fB$service\fP when calling the function;
the function may choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it\&.
.PP
If the \fB#compdef\fP line contains one of the options \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-P\fP,
the words following are taken to be patterns\&.  The function will be
called when completion is attempted for a command or context that matches
one of the patterns\&.  The options \fB\-p\fP and \fB\-P\fP are used to specify
patterns to be tried before or after other completions respectively\&.
Hence \fB\-P\fP may be used to specify default actions\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-N\fP is used after a list following \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-P\fP; it
specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns\&.  It is
possible to toggle between the three options as many times as necessary\&.

\fB#compdef \-k\fP \fIstyle key\-sequence\fP \&.\&.\&.
This option creates a widget behaving like the
builtin widget \fIstyle\fP and binds it to the given \fIkey\-sequence\fPs,
if any\&.  The \fIstyle\fP must be one of the builtin widgets that perform
completion, namely \fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP,
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBlist\-choices\fP,
\fBmenu\-complete\fP, \fBmenu\-expand\-or\-complete\fP, or
\fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP\&.  If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded (see
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)) the widget \fBmenu\-select\fP is also available\&.
.RS
.PP
When one of the \fIkey\-sequence\fPs is typed, the function in the file will
be invoked to generate the matches\&.  Note that a key will not be re\-bound
if it already was (that is, was bound to something other than
\fBundefined\-key\fP)\&.  The widget created has the same name as the file and
can be bound to any other keys using \fBbindkey\fP as usual\&.

\fB#compdef \-K\fP \fIwidget\-name\fP \fIstyle\fP \fIkey\-sequence\fP [ \fIname\fP \fIstyle\fP \fIseq\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This is similar to \fB\-k\fP except that only one \fIkey\-sequence\fP
argument may be given for each \fIwidget\-name\fP \fIstyle\fP pair\&.
However, the entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a
different set of arguments\&.  Note in particular that the
\fIwidget\-name\fP must be distinct in each set\&.  If it does not begin with
`\fB_\fP\&' this will be added\&.  The \fIwidget\-name\fP should not clash with
the name of any existing widget: names based on the name of the function
are most useful\&.  For example,

\fB#autoload\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ]
Functions with the \fB#autoload\fP tag are marked for autoloading but
are not otherwise treated specially\&.  Typically they are to be called
from within one of the completion functions\&.  Any \fIoptions\fP supplied
will be passed to the \fBautoload\fP builtin; a typical use is \fB+X\fP to
force the function to be loaded immediately\&.  Note that the \fB\-U\fP and
\fB\-z\fP flags are always added implicitly\&.
.PP
The \fB#\fP is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it\&.
The \fB#compdef\fP tags use the \fBcompdef\fP function described below; the

On the right hand side of an assignment\&.
.PP
Default implementations are supplied for each of these
contexts\&.  In most cases the context \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP is
implemented by a corresponding function \fB_\fP\fIcontext\fP, for example
the context `\fB\-tilde\-\fP\&' and the function `\fB_tilde\fP')\&.
.PP
The contexts \fB\-redirect\-\fP and \fB\-value\-\fP allow extra context\-specific
information\&.  (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each
context calling the function \fB_dispatch\fP\&.)  The extra
information is added separated by commas\&.
.PP
For the \fB\-redirect\-\fP context, the extra information is in the form
`\fB\-redirect\-,\fP\fIop\fP\fB,\fP\fIcommand\fP\&', where \fIop\fP is the
redirection operator and \fIcommand\fP is the name of the command on
the line\&.  If there is no command on the line yet, the \fIcommand\fP
field will be empty\&.
.PP
For the \fB\-value\-\fP context, the form is
`\fB\-value\-,\fP\fIname\fP\fB,\fP\fIcommand\fP\&', where \fIname\fP is the name of
the parameter on the left hand side of the assignment\&.
In the case of elements of an associative array, for
example `\fBassoc=(key <TAB>\fP\&', \fIname\fP is expanded to
`\fIname\fP\fB\-\fP\fIkey\fP\&'\&.  In certain special contexts, such as
completing after `\fBmake CFLAGS=\fP\&', the \fIcommand\fP part gives the
name of the command, here \fBmake\fP; otherwise it is empty\&.
.PP
It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the
functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively
replacing the elements with `\fB\-default\-\fP\&'\&.  For example, when
completing after `\fBfoo=<TAB>\fP\&', \fB_value\fP will try the names
`\fB\-value\-,foo,\fP\&' (note the empty \fIcommand\fP part),
`\fB\-value\-,foo,\-default\-\fP\&' and`\fB\-value\-,\-default\-,\-default\-\fP', in
that order, until it finds a function to handle the context\&.

Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form

argument is to be evaluated as shell code even if it contains an equal
sign\&.  The string will be executed using the \fBeval\fP builtin command to
generate completions\&.  This provides a way of avoiding having to define
a new completion function\&.  For example, to complete files ending in

The form with \fB\-k\fP defines a widget with the same name as the \fIfunction\fP

and will otherwise behave like the builtin widget whose name is given as
the \fIstyle\fP argument\&.  The widgets usable for this are:
\fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP,
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBlist\-choices\fP, \fBmenu\-complete\fP,
\fBmenu\-expand\-or\-complete\fP, and \fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP, as well as
\fBmenu\-select\fP if the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded\&.  The option \fB\-n\fP
prevents the key being bound if it is already to bound to something other

The form with \fB\-K\fP is similar and defines multiple widgets based on the

\fIname\fP, \fIstyle\fP and \fIkey\-seq\fPuence, where the latter two are as
for \fB\-k\fP and the first must be a unique widget name beginning with an

.SH "COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
.PP
This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,
and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches are
generated\&.
.PP
.SS "Overview"
.PP
When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the
completion system begins building the context\&.  The context represents
everything that the shell knows about the meaning of the command line
and the significance of the cursor position\&.  This takes account of a
number of things including the command word (such as `\fBgrep\fP\&' or
`\fBzsh\fP\&') and options to which the current word may be an argument
(such as the `\fB\-o\fP\&' option to \fBzsh\fP which takes a shell option as an
argument)\&.
.PP
The context starts out very generic ("we are beginning a completion")
and becomes more specific as more is learned ("the current word is in a
position that is usually a command name" or "the current word might be a
variable name" and so on)\&.  Therefore the context will vary during the
same call to the completion system\&.
.PP
This context information is condensed into a string consisting of multiple
fields separated by colons, referred to simply as `the context\&' in the
remainder of the documentation\&.  Note that a user of the completion system
rarely needs to compose a context string, unless for example a new
function is being written to perform completion for a new command\&.  What a
user may need to do is compose a \fIstyle\fP pattern, which is matched
against a context when needed to look up context\-sensitive options that
configure the completion system\&.
.PP
The next few paragraphs explain how a context is composed within the
completion function suite\&.  Following that is discussion of how \fIstyles\fP
are defined\&.  Styles determine such things as how the matches are
generated, similarly to shell options but with much more control\&.  They
are defined with the \fBzstyle\fP builtin command (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.
.PP
The context string always consists of a fixed set of fields, separated
by colons and with a leading colon before the first\&.  Fields which are
not yet known are left empty, but the surrounding colons appear anyway\&.
The fields are always in the order
\fB:completion:\fP\fIfunction\fP\fB:\fP\fIcompleter\fP\fB:\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB:\fP\fIargument\fP\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&.  These have the following meaning:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
The literal string \fBcompletion\fP, saying that this style is used by
the completion system\&.  This distinguishes the context from those used
by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIfunction\fP, if completion is called from a named widget rather
than through the normal completion system\&.  Typically this is blank, but
it is set by special widgets such as \fBpredict\-on\fP and the various
functions in the \fBWidget\fP directory of the distribution to the name of
that function, often in an abbreviated form\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIcompleter\fP currently active, the name of the function without the
leading underscore and with other underscores converted to hyphens\&.  A
`completer\&' is in overall control of how completion is to be performed;
`\fBcomplete\fP\&' is the simplest, but other completers exist to perform
related tasks such as correction, or to modify the behaviour of a later
completer\&.  See
the section `Control Functions\&' below 
for more information\&.  

.TP
\(bu
The \fIcommand\fP or a special \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP, just at it appears
following the \fB#compdef\fP tag or the \fBcompdef\fP function\&.  Completion
functions for commands that have sub\-commands usually modify this field
to contain the name of the command followed by a minus sign and the
sub\-command\&.  For example, the completion function for the \fBcvs\fP
command sets this field to \fBcvs\-add\fP when completing arguments to
the \fBadd\fP subcommand\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIargument\fP; this indicates which command line or option argument
we are completing\&.  For command arguments this generally takes the form
\fBargument\-\fP\fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is the number of the argument,
and for arguments to options the form \fBoption\-\fP\fIopt\fP\fB\-\fP\fIn\fP
where \fIn\fP is the number of the argument to option \fIopt\fP\&.  However,
this is only the case if the command line is parsed with standard
UNIX\-style options and arguments, so many completions do not set this\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fItag\fP\&.  As described previously, tags are used to discriminate between
the types of matches a completion function can generate in a certain context\&.
Any completion function may use any tag name it likes, but a list of the
more common ones is given below\&.

.PP
The context is gradually put together as the functions are executed, starting
with the main entry point, which adds \fB:completion:\fP and the \fIfunction\fP
element if necessary\&.  The completer then adds the \fIcompleter\fP element\&.
The contextual completion adds the \fIcommand\fP and \fIargument\fP options\&.
Finally, the \fItag\fP is added when the types of completion are known\&.
For example, the context name
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fB:completion::complete:dvips:option\-o\-1:files\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
says that normal completion was attempted as the first argument to the
option \fB\-o\fP of the command \fBdvips\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBdvips \-o \&.\&.\&.\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and the completion function will generate filenames\&.
.PP
Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags in an order given
by the completion function\&.  However, this can be altered by using the
\fBtag\-order\fP style\&.  Completion is then restricted to the list of given
tags in the given order\&.
.PP
The \fB_complete_help\fP bindable command shows all the contexts and tags
available for completion at a particular point\&.  This provides an easy
way of finding information for \fBtag\-order\fP and other styles\&.  It is
described in
the section `Bindable Commands\&' below\&.
.PP
When looking up styles the completion system uses full context names,
including the tag\&.  Looking up the value of a style therefore consists of
two things: the context, which is matched to the most specific (best
fitting) style pattern, and the name of the style itself, which must be
matched exactly\&.  The following examples demonstrate that style patterns
may be loosely defined for styles that apply broadly, or as tightly
defined as desired for styles that apply in narrower circumstances\&.
.PP
For example, many completion functions can generate matches in a
simple and a verbose form and use the \fBverbose\fP style to decide
which form should be used\&.  To make all such functions use the verbose form,
put
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' verbose yes\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
in a startup file (probably \fB\&.zshrc\fP)\&.
This gives the \fBverbose\fP style the value \fByes\fP in every
context inside the completion system, unless that context has a more
specific definition\&.  It is best to avoid giving the context as `\fB*\fP\&'
in case the style has some meaning outside the completion system\&.
.PP
Many such general purpose styles can be configured simply by using the
\fBcompinstall\fP function\&.
.PP
A more specific example of the use of the \fBverbose\fP style is by the
completion for the \fBkill\fP builtin\&.  If the style is set, the builtin
lists full job texts and process command lines; otherwise it shows the
bare job numbers and PIDs\&.  To turn the style off for this use only:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:kill:*:*' verbose no\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
For even more control, the style can use one of the tags `\fBjobs\fP\&' or

.RE
.PP
The \fB\-e\fP option to \fBzstyle\fP even allows completion function code to
appear as the argument to a style; this requires some understanding of
the internals of completion functions (see
see \fIzshcompwid\fP(1)))\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBzstyle \-e \&':completion:*' hosts 'reply=($myhosts)'\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This forces the value of the \fBhosts\fP style to be read from the
variable \fBmyhosts\fP each time a host name is needed; this is useful
if the value of \fBmyhosts\fP can change dynamically\&.
For another useful example, see the example in the description of the
\fBfile\-list\fP style below\&.  This form can be
slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such
as \fBmenu\fP and \fBlist\-rows\-first\fP\&.
.PP
Note that the order in which styles are \fIdefined\fP does not matter; the
style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
style to determine the set of values\&.  More precisely, strings are
preferred over patterns (for example, `\fB:completion::complete:::foo\fP\&' is
more specific than `\fB:completion::complete:::*\&'\fP), and longer patterns are
preferred over shorter patterns\&.
.PP
A good rule of thumb is that any completion style pattern that needs to
include more than one wildcard (\fB*\fP) and that does not end in a tag
name, should include all six colons (\fB:\fP), possibly surrounding
additional wildcards\&.
.PP
Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the completion
function\&.  However, the following two sections list some of the most
common tags and styles\&.

.SS "Standard Styles"
.PP
Note that the values of several of these styles represent boolean
values\&.  Any of the strings `\fBtrue\fP\&', `\fBon\fP',
`\fByes\fP\&', and `\fB1\fP' can be used for the value `true' and
any of the strings `\fBfalse\fP\&', `\fBoff\fP', `\fBno\fP', and `\fB0\fP' for
the value `false\&'\&.  The behavior for any other value is undefined 
except where explicitly mentioned\&.  The default value may
be either `true\&' or `false' if the style is not set\&.
.PP
Some of these styles are tested first for every possible tag
corresponding to a type of match, and if no style was found, for the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  The most notable styles of this type are \fBmenu\fP, 
\fBlist\-colors\fP and styles controlling completion listing such as 
\fBlist\-packed\fP and \fBlast\-prompt\fP\&.  When tested for the \fBdefault\fP
tag, only the \fIfunction\fP field of the context will be set so that
a style using the default tag will normally be defined along the lines of:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:default' menu \&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBaccept\-exact\fP
This is tested for the default tag in addition to the tags valid for
the current context\&.  If it is set to `true\&' and any of the trial
matches is the same as the string on the command line, this match will
immediately be accepted (even if it would otherwise be considered
ambiguous)\&.
.RS
.PP
When completing pathnames (where the tag used is `\fBpaths\fP\&')
this style accepts any number of patterns as the value in addition to
the boolean values\&.  Pathnames matching one of these
patterns will be accepted immediately even if the command line contains
some more partially typed pathname components and these match no file
under the directory accepted\&.
.PP
This style is also used by the \fB_expand\fP completer to decide if
words beginning with a tilde or parameter expansion should be
expanded\&.  For example, if there are parameters
\fBfoo\fP and \fBfoobar\fP, the string `\fB$foo\fP\&' will only be expanded if 
\fBaccept\-exact\fP is set to `true\&'; otherwise the completion system will
be allowed to complete \fB$foo\fP to \fB$foobar\fP\&. If the style is set to
`\fBcontinue\fP\&', \fB_expand\fP will add the expansion as a match and the completion
system will also be allowed to continue\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBaccept\-exact\-dirs\fP
This is used by filename completion\&.  Unlike \fBaccept\-exact\fP it is
a boolean\&.  By default, filename completion examines all components
of a path to see if there are completions of that component, even if
the component matches an existing directory\&.  For example, when
completion after \fB/usr/bin/\fP, the function examines possible
completions to \fB/usr\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
When this style is `true\&', any prefix of a path that matches an existing
directory is accepted without any attempt to complete it further\&.
Hence, in the given example, the path \fB/usr/bin/\fP is accepted
immediately and completion tried in that directory\&.
.PP
If you wish to inhibit this behaviour entirely, set the \fBpath\-completion\fP
style (see below) to `false\&'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBadd\-space\fP
This style is used by the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  If it is `true\&' (the
default), a space will be inserted after all words resulting from the 
expansion, or a slash in the case of directory names\&.  If the value
is `\fBfile\fP\&', the completer will only add a space
to names of existing files\&.  Either a boolean `true\&' or the value
`\fBfile\fP\&' may be combined with `\fBsubst\fP', in which case the completer
will not add a space to words generated from the expansion of a
substitution of the form `\fB$(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\&' or `\fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP'\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB_prefix\fP completer uses this style as a simple boolean value
to decide if a space should be inserted before the suffix\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBambiguous\fP
This applies when completing non\-final components of filename paths, in
other words those with a trailing slash\&.  If it is set, the cursor is
left after the first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use\&.  The style is always tested with the \fBpaths\fP tag\&.
.TP
\fBassign\-list\fP
When completing after an equals sign that is being treated as an
assignment, the completion system normally completes only one filename\&.
In some cases the value  may be a list of filenames separated by colons,
as with \fBPATH\fP and similar parameters\&.  This style can be set to a
list of patterns matching the names of such parameters\&.
.RS
.PP
The default is to complete lists when the word on the line already
contains a colon\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBauto\-description\fP
If set, this style\&'s value will be used as the description for options that
are not described by the completion functions, but that have exactly
one argument\&.  The sequence `\fB%d\fP\&' in the value will be replaced by
the description for this argument\&.  Depending on personal preferences,
it may be useful to set this style to something like `\fBspecify: %d\fP\&'\&. 
Note that this may not work for some commands\&.
.TP
\fBavoid\-completer\fP
This is used by the \fB_all_matches\fP completer to decide if the string 
consisting of all matches should be added to the list currently being
generated\&.  Its value is a list of names of completers\&.  If any of
these is the name of the completer that generated the matches in this
completion, the string will not be added\&.
.RS
.PP
The default value for this style is `\fB_expand _old_list _correct
_approximate\fP\&', i\&.e\&. it contains the completers for which a string
with all matches will almost never be wanted\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcache\-path\fP
This style defines the path where any cache files containing dumped
completion data are stored\&.  It defaults to `\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zcompcache\fP\&', or
`\fB$HOME/\&.zcompcache\fP\&' if \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP is not defined\&.  The completion
cache will not be used unless the \fBuse\-cache\fP style is set\&.
.TP
\fBcache\-policy\fP
This style defines the function that will be used to determine whether
a cache needs rebuilding\&.  See the section on the \fB_cache_invalid\fP
function below\&.
.TP
\fBcall\-command\fP
This style is used in the function for commands such as \fBmake\fP and
\fBant\fP where calling the command directly to generate matches suffers
problems such as being slow or, as in the case of \fBmake\fP can
potentially cause actions in the makefile to be executed\&. If it is set
to `true\&' the command is called to generate matches\&. The default value
of this style is `false\&'\&.
.TP
\fBcommand\fP
In many places, completion functions need to call external commands to
generate the list of completions\&.  This style can be used to override the
command that is called in some such cases\&.  The elements of the value are
joined with spaces to form a command line to execute\&.  The value can also
start with a hyphen, in which case the usual command will be added to the
end; this is most useful for putting `\fBbuiltin\fP\&' or `\fBcommand\fP' in
front to make sure the appropriate version of a command is called, for
example to avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an external
command\&.
.RS
.PP
As an example, the completion function for process IDs uses this
style with the \fBprocesses\fP tag to generate the IDs to complete and
the list of processes to display (if the \fBverbose\fP style is `true\&')\&.
The list produced by the command should look like the output of the
\fBps\fP command\&.  The first line is not displayed, but is searched for
the string `\fBPID\fP\&' (or `\fBpid\fP') to find the position of the
process IDs in the following lines\&.  If the line does not contain
`\fBPID\fP\&', the first numbers in each of the other lines are taken as the 
process IDs to complete\&.
.PP
Note that the completion function generally has to call the specified
command for each attempt to generate the completion list\&.  Hence
care should be taken to specify only commands that take a short
time to run, and in particular to avoid any that may never terminate\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcommand\-path\fP
This is a list of directories to search for commands to complete\&.  The
default for this style is the value of the special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.
.TP
\fBcommands\fP
This is used by the function completing sub\-commands for the system
initialisation scripts (residing in \fB/etc/init\&.d\fP or somewhere not
too far away from that)\&.  Its values give the default commands to
complete for those commands for which the completion function isn\&'t
able to find them out automatically\&.  The default for this style are
the two strings `\fBstart\fP\&' and `\fBstop\fP'\&.
.TP
\fBcomplete\fP
This is used by the \fB_expand_alias\fP function when invoked as a
bindable command\&.  If set to `true\&' and the word on the command
line is not the name of an alias, matching alias names will be
completed\&.
.TP
\fBcomplete\-options\fP
This is used by the completer for \fBcd\fP, \fBchdir\fP and \fBpushd\fP\&.
For these commands a \fB\-\fP is used to introduce a directory stack entry
and completion of these is far more common than completing options\&.
Hence unless the value of this style is `true\&' options will not be
completed, even after an initial \fB\-\fP\&.  If it is `true\&', options will
be completed after an initial \fB\-\fP unless there is a preceding
\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP on the command line\&.
.TP
\fBcompleter\fP
The strings given as the value of this style provide the names of the
completer functions to use\&. The available completer functions are
described in
the section `Control Functions\&' below\&.
.RS
.PP
Each string may be either the name of a completer function or a string
of the form `\fIfunction\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\&'\&.  In the first case the
\fIcompleter\fP field of the context will contain the name of the
completer without the leading underscore and with all other
underscores replaced by hyphens\&.  In the second case the
\fIfunction\fP is the name of the completer to call, but the context
will contain the user\-defined \fIname\fP in the \fIcompleter\fP field of
the context\&.  If the \fIname\fP starts with a hyphen, the string for the
context will be build from the name of the completer function as in
the first case with the \fIname\fP appended to it\&.  For example: 
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer _complete _complete:\-foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, completion will call the \fB_complete\fP completer twice, once
using `\fBcomplete\fP\&' and once using `\fBcomplete\-foo\fP' in the
\fIcompleter\fP field of the context\&.  Normally, using the same
completer more than once only makes sense when used with the
`\fIfunctions\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\&' form, because otherwise the context
name will be the same in all calls to the completer; possible
exceptions to this rule are the \fB_ignored\fP and \fB_prefix\fP
completers\&.
.PP
The default value for this style is `\fB_complete _ignored\fP\&':
only completion will be done, first using the \fBignored\-patterns\fP style
and the \fB$fignore\fP array and then without ignoring matches\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcondition\fP
This style is used by the \fB_list\fP completer function to decide if
insertion of matches should be delayed unconditionally\&. The default is 
`true\&'\&.
.TP
\fBdelimiters\fP
This style is used when adding a delimiter for use with history
modifiers or glob qualifiers that have delimited arguments\&.  It is
an array of preferred delimiters to add\&.  Non\-special characters are
preferred as the completion system may otherwise become confused\&.
The default list is \fB:\fP, \fB+\fP, \fB/\fP, \fB\-\fP, \fB%\fP\&.  The list
may be empty to force a delimiter to be typed\&.
.TP
\fBdisabled\fP
If this is set to `true\&', the \fB_expand_alias\fP completer and bindable 
command will try to expand disabled aliases, too\&.  The default is
`false\&'\&.

\fBdomains\fP
A list of names of network domains for completion\&.
If this is not set, domain names will be taken from
the file \fB/etc/resolv\&.conf\fP\&.
.TP
\fBenviron\fP
The environ style is used when completing for `\fBsudo\fP\&'\&.  It is set to an
array of `\fIVAR\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\&' assignments to be exported into the
local environment before the completion for the target command is invoked\&.
.RS

\fBexpand\fP

parts, such as path names\&.
.RS
.PP
If one of its values is the string `\fBprefix\fP\&', the partially typed
word from the line will be expanded as far as possible even if trailing
parts cannot be completed\&.
.PP
If one of its values is the string `\fBsuffix\fP\&', matching names for
components after the first ambiguous one will also be added\&.  This means
that the resulting string is the longest unambiguous string possible\&.
However, menu completion can be used to cycle through all matches\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfake\fP
This style may be set for any completion context\&.  It
specifies additional strings that will always be completed in that
context\&.  The form of each string is `\fIvalue\fP\fB:\fP\fIdescription\fP\&'; 
the colon and description may be omitted, but any literal colons in
\fIvalue\fP must be quoted with a backslash\&.  Any \fIdescription\fP
provided is shown alongside the value in completion listings\&.

.RE

\fBfake\-always\fP
This works identically to the \fBfake\fP style except that

The following shows a way of supplementing any tag with arbitrary data, but
having it behave for display purposes like a separate tag\&.  In this example
we use the features of the \fBtag\-order\fP style to divide the
\fBnamed\-directories\fP tag into two when performing completion with
the standard completer \fBcomplete\fP for arguments of \fBcd\fP\&.  The tag
\fBnamed\-directories\-normal\fP behaves as normal, but the tag
\fBnamed\-directories\-mine\fP contains a fixed set of directories\&.

\fBfake\-files\fP
This style is used when completing files and looked up 
without a tag\&.  Its values are of the form
`\fIdir\fP\fB:\fP\fInames\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'\&.  This will add the \fInames\fP (strings
separated by spaces) as
possible matches when completing in the directory \fIdir\fP, even if no 
such files really exist\&.  The dir may be a pattern; pattern characters
or colons in \fIdir\fP should be quoted with a backslash to be treated
literally\&.

This can be useful on systems that support special file systems whose
top\-level pathnames can not be listed or generated with glob patterns\&.
It can also be used for directories for which one does not have read
permission\&.

to all directories on a particular file system\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfake\-parameters\fP
This is used by the completion function for parameter names\&.
Its values are names of parameters that might not yet be
set but should be completed nonetheless\&.  Each name may also be 
followed by a colon and a string specifying the type of the parameter
(like `\fBscalar\fP\&', `\fBarray\fP' or `\fBinteger\fP')\&.  If the type is
given, the name will only be completed if parameters of that type are
required in the particular context\&.  Names for which no type is
specified will always be completed\&.
.TP
\fBfile\-list\fP
This style controls whether files completed using the standard builtin
mechanism are to be listed with a long list similar to \fBls \-l\fP\&.
Note that this feature uses the shell module
\fBzsh/stat\fP for file information; this loads the builtin \fBstat\fP
which will replace any external \fBstat\fP executable\&.  To avoid
this the following code can be included in an initialization file:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzmodload \-i zsh/stat
disable stat\fP
.fi
.RE

The style may either be set to a `true\&' value (or `\fBall\fP'), or
one of the values `\fBinsert\fP\&' or `\fBlist\fP', indicating that files
are to be listed in long format in all circumstances, or when
attempting to insert a file name, or when listing file names
without attempting to insert one\&.

More generally, the value may be an array of any of the above values,
optionally followed by \fB=\fP\fInum\fP\&.  If \fInum\fP is present it

\fBfile\-patterns\fP
This is used by the standard function for completing filenames,
\fB_files\fP\&.  If the style is unset up to three tags are offered,
`\fBglobbed\-files\fP\&',`\fBdirectories\fP' and `\fBall\-files\fP', depending on
the types of files  expected by the caller of \fB_files\fP\&.  The first two
(`\fBglobbed\-files\fP\&' and `\fBdirectories\fP') are normally offered
together to make it easier to complete files in sub\-directories\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fBfile\-patterns\fP style provides alternatives to the default tags,
which are not used\&.  Its value consists of elements of the form
`\fIpattern\fP\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&'; each string may contain any number of
such specifications separated by spaces\&.
.PP
The \fIpattern\fP is a pattern that is to be used to generate filenames\&.
Any occurrence of the sequence `\fB%p\fP\&' is replaced by any
pattern(s)
passed by the function calling \fB_files\fP\&.  Colons in the pattern must
be preceded by a backslash to make them distinguishable from the colon
before the \fItag\fP\&.  If more than one pattern is needed, the patterns
can be given inside braces, separated by commas\&.
.PP
The \fItag\fPs of all strings in the value will be offered by \fB_files\fP
and used when looking up other styles\&.  Any \fItag\fPs in the same
word will be offered at the same time and before later words\&.
If no `\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&' is given the `\fBfiles\fP' tag will be used\&.
.PP
The \fItag\fP may also be followed by an optional second colon and a
description, which will be used for the `\fB%d\fP\&' in the value of
the \fBformat\fP style (if that is set) instead of the default
description supplied by the completion function\&.  If the description
given here contains itself a `\fB%d\fP\&', that is replaced with the
description supplied by the completion function\&.
.PP
For example, to make the \fBrm\fP command first complete only names of
object files and then the names of all files if there is no matching
object file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:rm:*:*' file\-patterns \e

.fi
.RE

To alter the default behaviour of file completion \-\- offer files

.fi
.RE

This works even where there is no special pattern: \fB_files\fP matches
all files using the pattern `\fB*\fP\&' at the first step and stops when it
sees this pattern\&.  Note also it will never try a pattern more than once
for a single completion attempt\&.
.PP
During the execution of completion functions, the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP
option is in effect, so the characters `\fB#\fP\&', `\fB~\fP' and `\fB^\fP' have
special meanings in the patterns\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfile\-sort\fP
The standard filename completion function uses this style without a tag
to determine in which order the names should be listed; menu completion
will cycle through them in the same order\&.  The possible
values are: `\fBsize\fP\&' to sort by the size of the file;
`\fBlinks\fP\&' to sort by the number of links to the file;
`\fBmodification\fP\&' (or `\fBtime\fP' or `\fBdate\fP') to sort by the last
modification time; `\fBaccess\fP\&' to sort by the last access time; and
`\fBinode\fP\&' (or `\fBchange\fP') to sort by the last inode change
time\&.  If the style is set to any other value, or is unset, files will be
sorted alphabetically by name\&.  If the value contains the string
`\fBreverse\fP\&', sorting is done in the opposite order\&.  If the value
contains the string `\fBfollow\fP\&', timestamps are associated with the
targets of symbolic links; the default is to use the timestamps
of the links themselves\&.
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
This is used by the LDAP plugin for e\-mail address completion to specify
the attributes to match against when filtering entries\&.  So for example, if
the style is set to `\fBsn\fP\&', matching is done against surnames\&.  Standard
LDAP filtering is used so normal completion matching is bypassed\&.  If this
style is not set, the LDAP plugin is skipped\&.  You may also need to set the
\fBcommand\fP style to specify how to connect to your LDAP server\&.
.TP
\fBforce\-list\fP
This forces a list of completions to be shown at any point where listing is
done, even in cases where the list would usually be suppressed\&.
For example, normally the list is only shown if
there are at least two different matches\&.  By setting this style to
`\fBalways\fP\&', the list will always be shown, even if there is only a
single match that will immediately be accepted\&.  The style may also
be set to a number\&.  In this case the list will be shown if there are
at least that many matches, even if they would all insert the same
string\&.
.RS
.PP
This style is tested for the default tag as well as for each tag valid
for the current completion\&.  Hence the listing can be forced only for
certain types of match\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBformat\fP
If this is set for the \fBdescriptions\fP tag, its value is used as a
string to display above matches in completion lists\&.  The sequence
`\fB%d\fP\&' in this string will be replaced with a short description of
what these matches are\&.  This string may also contain the following
sequences to specify output attributes
as described in the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1):
`\fB%B\fP\&', `\fB%S\fP', `\fB%U\fP', `\fB%F\fP', `\fB%K\fP' and their lower case
counterparts, as well as `\fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP\&'\&.  `\fB%F\fP', `\fB%K\fP' and
`\fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP\&' take arguments in the same form as prompt
expansion\&.  Note that the sequence `\fB%G\fP\&' is not available; an argument
to `\fB%{\fP\&' should be used instead\&.
.RS
.PP
The style is tested with each tag valid for the current completion
before it is tested for the \fBdescriptions\fP tag\&.  Hence different format 
strings can be defined for different types of match\&.
.PP
Note also that some completer functions define additional
`\fB%\fP\&'\-sequences\&.  These are described for the completer functions that 
make use of them\&.
.PP
Some completion functions display messages that may be customised by
setting this style for the \fBmessages\fP tag\&.  Here, the `\fB%d\fP\&' is
replaced with a message given by the completion function\&.
.PP
Finally, the format string is looked up with the \fBwarnings\fP tag, 
for use when no matches could be generated at all\&.  In this case the
`\fB%d\fP\&' is replaced with the descriptions for the matches that were
expected separated by spaces\&.  The sequence `\fB%D\fP\&' is replaced with
the same descriptions separated by newlines\&.
.PP
It is possible to use printf\-style field width specifiers with `\fB%d\fP\&'
and similar escape sequences\&.  This is handled by the \fBzformat\fP
builtin command from the \fBzsh/zutil\fP module, see
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.

\fBglob\fP
This is used by the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  If

completer and bindable command will try to expand global aliases\&.
.TP
\fBgroup\-name\fP
The completion system can group different types of matches, which appear
in separate lists\&.  This style can be used to give the names of groups
for particular tags\&.  For example, in command position the completion
system generates names of builtin and external commands, names of
aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words as possible
completions\&.  To have the external commands and shell functions listed
separately:
.RS

.RE
.PP
As a consequence, any match with the same tag will be displayed in the
same group\&.
.PP
If the name given is the empty string the name of the tag for
the matches will be used as the name of the group\&.  So, to have all
different types of matches displayed separately, one can just set:
.PP

\fBgroup\-order\fP
This style is additional to the \fBgroup\-name\fP style to specify the
order for display of the groups defined by that style (compare \fBtag\-order\fP,
which determines which completions appear at all)\&.  The groups named
are shown in the given order; any other groups
are shown in the order defined by the completion function\&.

For example, to have names of builtin commands, shell functions and
external commands appear in that order when completing in command

\fBhosts\-ports\fP
This style is used by commands that need or accept hostnames and
network ports\&.  The strings in the value should be of the form
`\fIhost\fP\fB:\fP\fIport\fP\&'\&.  Valid ports are determined by the presence
of hostnames; multiple ports for the same host may appear\&.
.TP
\fBignore\-line\fP
This is tested for each tag valid for the current completion\&.  If
it is set to `true\&', none of the words that are already on the line
will be considered as possible completions\&.  If it is set to
`\fBcurrent\fP\&', the word the cursor is on will not be considered as a
possible completion\&.  The value `\fBcurrent\-shown\fP\&' is similar but only
applies if the list of completions is currently shown on the screen\&.
Finally, if the style is set to `\fBother\fP\&', all words on the line except
for the current one will be excluded from the possible completions\&.
.RS
.PP
The values `\fBcurrent\fP\&' and `\fBcurrent\-shown\fP' are a bit like the
opposite of the \fBaccept\-exact\fP style:  only strings with
missing characters will be completed\&.

Note that you almost certainly don\&'t want to set this to `true' or
`\fBother\fP\&' for a general

.RS
.PP

\fBparent\fP
The name of any directory whose path is already contained in the word on

directory \fBfoo\fP will not be considered a valid completion\&.
.TP
\fBpwd\fP
The name of the current working directory will not be completed; hence,
for example, completion after \fB\&.\&./\fP will not use the name of the current

In addition, the value may include one or both of:
.PP

.TP
.PD
\fB\&.\&.\fP

.TP
\fBinsert\-ids\fP
When completing process IDs, for example as arguments to the \fBkill\fP and
\fBwait\fP builtins the name of a
command may be converted to the appropriate process ID\&.  A problem
arises when the process name typed is not unique\&.  By default (or if this
style is set explicitly to `\fBmenu\fP\&') the name will be converted
immediately to a set of possible IDs, and menu completion will be started
to cycle through them\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value of the style is `\fBsingle\fP\&',
the shell will wait until the user has typed enough to make the command
unique before converting the name to an ID; attempts at completion will
be unsuccessful until that point\&.  If the value is any other
string, menu completion will be started when the string typed by the
user is longer than the common prefix to the corresponding IDs\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBinsert\-tab\fP
If this is set to `true\&', the completion system will

.RS
.PP
The value may also contain the substrings `\fBpending\fP\&' or
`\fBpending=\fP\fIval\fP\&'\&.  In this case, the typed character will be
inserted instead of starting completion when there is unprocessed input
pending\&.  If a \fIval\fP is given, completion will not be done if there
are at least that many characters of unprocessed input\&.  This is often
useful when pasting characters into a terminal\&.  Note
however, that it relies on the \fB$PENDING\fP special parameter from the
\fBzsh/zle\fP module being set properly which is not guaranteed on all

\fBinsert\-unambiguous\fP
This is used by the \fB_match\fP and \fB_approximate\fP completers\&.
These completers are often used with menu completion since the word typed

completion only if it could find no unambiguous initial string at
least as long as the original string typed by the user\&.

In the case of the \fB_approximate\fP completer, the completer

unchanged if it does not match unambiguously\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBkeep\-prefix\fP
This style is used by the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  If it is `true\&', the
completer will try to keep a prefix containing a tilde or parameter
expansion\&.  Hence, for example, the string `\fB~/f*\fP\&' would be expanded to
`\fB~/foo\fP\&' instead of `\fB/home/user/foo\fP'\&.  If the style is set to
`\fBchanged\fP\&' (the default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if
there were other changes between the expanded words and the original
word from the command line\&.  Any other value forces the prefix to be
expanded unconditionally\&.
.RS
.PP
The behaviour of \fB_expand\fP when this style is `true\&' is to cause \fB_expand\fP
to give up when a single expansion with the restored prefix is the same
as the original; hence any remaining completers may be called\&.

\fBlast\-prompt\fP
This is a more flexible form of the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option\&.
If it is `true\&', the completion system will try to return the cursor to
the previous command line after displaying a completion list\&.  It is
tested for all tags valid for the current completion, then the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  The cursor will be moved back to the
previous line if this style is `true\&' for all types of match\&.  Note
that unlike the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option this is independent of the
numeric argument\&.

\fBknown\-hosts\-files\fP
This style should contain a list of files to search for host names and

ssh \fBknown_hosts\fP files\&.  If it is not set, the files
\fB/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\fP and \fB~/\&.ssh/known_hosts\fP are used\&.

\fBlist\fP
This style is used by the \fB_history_complete_word\fP bindable command\&.
If it is set to `true\&' it has no effect\&.  If it is set to `false'

controlling listing behaviour, in particular \fBAUTO_LIST\fP\&.  The context
always starts with `\fB:completion:history\-words\fP\&'\&.

\fBlist\-colors\fP
If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded, this style can be used to set
color specifications\&.  This mechanism replaces the use of the

the section `The zsh/complist Module\&' in \fIzshmodules\fP(1), but the syntax is the same\&.

In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is also possible to
use group names specified explicitly by the \fBgroup\-name\fP tag together

\fBlist\-grouped\fP
If this style is `true\&' (the default), the completion system will try to
make certain completion listings more compact by grouping matches\&.
For example, options for commands that have the same description (shown

entry\&.  However, menu selection can be used to cycle through all the
matches\&.

\fBlist\-packed\fP
This is tested for each tag valid in the current context as well as the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  If it is set to `true\&', the corresponding matches

The value may contain the escape sequences:
`\fB%l\fP\&' or `\fB%L\fP', which will be replaced by the number of the last line

case\-insensitive completion only with \fB_complete\fP:

User\-defined names, as explained for the \fBcompleter\fP style, are
available\&.  This makes it possible to try the same completer more than
once with different match specifications each time\&.  For example, to try
normal completion without a match specification, then normal completion

partial\-word completion:
.PP

If the style is unset in any context no match specification is applied\&.
Note also that some completers such as \fB_correct\fP and \fB_approximate\fP
do not use the match specifications at all, though these completers will
only ever be called once even if the \fBmatcher\-list\fP contains more than
one element\&.
.PP
Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the \fIentire\fP
completion is done for each element of \fBmatcher\-list\fP, which can
quickly reduce the shell\&'s performance\&.  As a rough rule of thumb,
one to three strings will give acceptable performance\&.  On the other
hand, putting multiple space\-separated values into the same string does
not have an appreciable impact on performance\&.
.PP
If there is no current matcher or it is empty, and the option
\fBNO_CASE_GLOB\fP is in effect, the matching for files is performed
case\-insensitively in any case\&.  However, any matcher must
explicitly specify case\-insensitive matching if that is required\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBmax\-errors\fP
This is used by the \fB_approximate\fP and \fB_correct\fP completer functions
to determine the maximum number of errors to allow\&.  The completer will try
to generate completions by first allowing one error, then two errors, and
so on, until either a match or matches were found or the maximum number of
errors given by this style has been reached\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value for this style contains the string `\fBnumeric\fP\&', the 
completer function will take any numeric argument as the
maximum number of errors allowed\&. For example, with
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:approximate:::' max\-errors 2 numeric\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given, but with
a numeric argument of six (as in `\fBESC\-6 TAB\fP\&'), up to six
errors are accepted\&.  Hence with a value of `\fB0 numeric\fP\&', no correcting
completion will be attempted unless a numeric argument is given\&.
.PP
If the value contains the string `\fBnot\-numeric\fP\&', the completer
will \fInot\fP try to generate corrected
completions when given a numeric argument, so in this case the number given
should be greater than zero\&.  For example, `\fB2 not\-numeric\fP\&' specifies that
correcting completion with two errors will usually be performed, but if a
numeric argument is given, correcting completion will not be
performed\&.
.PP
The default value for this style is `\fB2 numeric\fP\&'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBmax\-matches\-width\fP
This style is used to determine the trade off between the width of the
display used for matches and the width used for their descriptions when
the \fBverbose\fP style is in effect\&.  The value gives the number of
display columns to reserve for the matches\&.  The default is half the
width of the screen\&.
.RS
.PP
This has the most impact when several matches have the
same description and so will be grouped together\&.  Increasing the style
will allow more matches to be grouped together; decreasing it will allow
more of the description to be visible\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBmenu\fP
If this is `true\&' in the context of any of the tags defined
for the current completion menu completion will be used\&.  The value for
a specific tag will take precedence over that for the `\fBdefault\fP\&' tag\&.
.RS
.PP
If none of the values found in this way is `true\&' but at least
one is set to `\fBauto\fP\&', the shell behaves as if the \fBAUTO_MENU\fP
option is set\&.
.PP
If one of the values is explicitly set to `false\&', menu
completion will be explicitly turned off, overriding the
\fBMENU_COMPLETE\fP option and other settings\&.
.PP
In the form `\fByes=\fP\fInum\fP\&', where `\fByes\fP' may be any of the
`true\&' values (`\fByes\fP', `\fBtrue\fP', `\fBon\fP' and `\fB1\fP'),
menu completion will be turned on if there are at least \fInum\fP matches\&.
In the form `\fByes=long\fP\&', menu completion will be turned on
if the list does not fit on the screen\&.  This does not activate menu
completion if the widget normally only lists completions, but menu
completion can be activated in that case with the value `\fByes=long\-list\fP\&'
(Typically, the value `\fBselect=long\-list\fP\&' described later is more
useful as it provides control over scrolling\&.)
.PP
Similarly, with any of the `false\&' values (as in `\fBno=10\fP'), menu
completion will \fInot\fP be used if there are \fInum\fP or more matches\&.  
.PP
The value of this widget also controls menu selection, as implemented by
the \fBzsh/complist\fP module\&.  The following values may appear either
alongside or instead of the values above\&.
.PP
If the value contains the string `\fBselect\fP\&', menu selection
will be started unconditionally\&.
.PP
In the form `\fBselect=\fP\fInum\fP\&', menu selection will only be started if
there are at least \fInum\fP matches\&.  If the values for more than one
tag provide a number, the smallest number is taken\&.
.PP
Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining a value
containing the string`\fBno\-select\fP\&'\&.
.PP
It is also possible to start menu selection only if the list of
matches does not fit on the screen by using the value
`\fBselect=long\fP\&'\&.  To start menu selection even if the current widget
only performs listing, use the value `\fBselect=long\-list\fP\&'\&.
.PP
To turn on menu completion or menu selection when a there are a certain
number of matches \fIor\fP the list of matches does not fit on the
screen, both of `\fByes=\fP\&' and `\fBselect=\fP' may be given twice, once
with a number and once with `\fBlong\fP\&' or `\fBlong\-list\fP'\&.
.PP
Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu selection\&.
The word `\fBinteractive\fP\&' in the value causes interactive mode
to be entered immediately when menu selection is started; see
the description of the \fBzsh/complist\fP module in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)
for a description of interactive mode\&.  Including the string
`\fBsearch\fP\&' does the same for incremental search mode\&.  To select backward
incremental search, include the string `\fBsearch\-backward\fP\&'\&.

\fBmuttrc\fP
If set, gives the location of the mutt configuration file\&.  It defaults

.TP
\fBnumbers\fP
This is used with the \fBjobs\fP tag\&.  If it is `true\&', the shell will
complete job numbers instead of the shortest unambiguous prefix
of the job command text\&.  If the value is a number, job numbers will
only be used if that many words from the job descriptions are required to
resolve ambiguities\&.  For example, if the value is `\fB1\fP\&', strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their command lines\&.
.TP
\fBold\-list\fP
This is used by the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.  If it is set to `\fBalways\fP\&',
then standard widgets which perform listing will retain the current list of
matches, however they were generated; this can be turned off explicitly
with the value `\fBnever\fP\&', giving the behaviour without the \fB_oldlist\fP
completer\&.  If the style is unset, or any other value, then the existing
list of completions is displayed if it is not already; otherwise, the
standard completion list is generated; this is the default behaviour of
\fB_oldlist\fP\&.  However, if there is an old list and this style contains
the name of the completer function that generated the list, then the
old list will be used even if it was generated by a widget which does
not do listing\&.
.RS
.PP
For example, suppose you type \fB^Xc\fP to use the \fB_correct_word\fP
widget, which generates a list of corrections for the word under the
cursor\&.  Usually, typing \fB^D\fP would generate a standard list of
completions for the word on the command line, and show that\&.  With
\fB_oldlist\fP, it will instead show the list of corrections already
generated\&.
.PP
As another example consider the \fB_match\fP completer: with the
\fBinsert\-unambiguous\fP style set to `true\&' it inserts only a common prefix
string, if there is any\&.  However, this may remove parts of the original
pattern, so that further completion could produce more matches than on the
first attempt\&.  By using the \fB_oldlist\fP completer and setting this style
to \fB_match\fP, the list of matches generated on the first attempt will be
used again\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBold\-matches\fP
This is used by the \fB_all_matches\fP completer to decide if an old
list of matches should be used if one exists\&.  This is selected by one of
the `true\&' values or by the string `\fBonly\fP'\&.  If
the value is `\fBonly\fP\&', \fB_all_matches\fP will only use an old list
and won\&'t have any effect on the list of matches currently being
generated\&.
.RS
.PP
If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the \fB_all_matches\fP
completer unconditionally\&.  One possible use is for either this style or
the \fBcompleter\fP style to be defined with the \fB\-e\fP option to
\fBzstyle\fP to make the style conditional\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBold\-menu\fP
This is used by the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.  It controls how menu
completion behaves when a completion has already been inserted and the
user types a standard completion key such as \fBTAB\fP\&.  The default
behaviour of \fB_oldlist\fP is that menu completion always continues
with the existing list of completions\&.  If this style is set to
`false\&', however, a new completion is started if the old list was
generated by a different completion command; this is the behaviour without
the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.
.RS
.PP
For example, suppose you type \fB^Xc\fP to generate a list of corrections,
and menu completion is started in one of the usual ways\&.  Usually, or with
this style set to `false\&', typing \fBTAB\fP at this point would start
trying to complete the line as it now appears\&.  With \fB_oldlist\fP, it
instead continues to cycle through the list of corrections\&.

\fBoriginal\fP
This is used by the \fB_approximate\fP and \fB_correct\fP
completers to decide if the original string should be added as
a possible completion\&.  Normally, this is done only if there are
at least two possible corrections, but if this style is set to `true\&', it
is always added\&.  Note that the style will be examined with the

The function that completes color names uses this style with the

the style is not set but this file is found in one of various standard
locations it will be used as the default\&.
.TP
\fBpath\-completion\fP
This is used by filename completion\&.  By default, filename completion
examines all components of a path to see if there are completions of
that component\&.  For example, \fB/u/b/z\fP can be completed to
\fB/usr/bin/zsh\fP\&.  Explicitly setting this style to `false\&' inhibits this
behaviour for path components up to the \fB/\fP before the cursor; this
overrides the setting of \fBaccept\-exact\-dirs\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
Even with the style set to `false\&', it is still possible to complete
multiple paths by setting the option \fBCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\fP and moving the
cursor back to the first component in the path to be completed\&.  For

\fBrecursive\-files\fP
If this style is set, its value is an array of patterns to be

just attempted, then the elements tested against \fB$PWD/\fP in turn\&.
If one matches, then the shell reattempts completion by prepending the word
on the command line with each directory in the expansion of \fB**/*(/)\fP

\fBselect\-scroll\fP
This style is tested for the \fBdefault\fP tag and determines how a
completion list is scrolled during a menu selection (see the \fBmenu\fP
style above) when the completion list does not fit on the screen as a
whole\&.  If the value is `\fB0\fP\&' (zero), the list is scrolled by
half\-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the list is scrolled by the
given number of lines; if it is a negative number, the list is scrolled by a
screenful minus the absolute value of the given number of lines\&.
The default is to scroll by single lines\&.

\fBseparate\-sections\fP
This style is used with the \fBmanuals\fP tag when completing names of
manual pages\&.  If it is `true\&', entries for different sections are
added separately using tag names of the form `\fBmanual\&.\fP\fIX\fP\&',
where \fIX\fP is the section number\&.  When the \fBgroup\-name\fP style is
also in effect, pages from different sections will appear separately\&.

\fBshow\-ambiguity\fP
If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded, this style can be used to

\fBshow\-completer\fP
Tested whenever a new completer is tried\&.  If it is `true\&', the completion

match and the original string are both added as matches and menu completion

\fBsort\fP
Many completion widgets call \fB_description\fP at some point which
decides whether the matches are added sorted or unsorted (often
indirectly via \fB_wanted\fP or \fB_requested\fP)\&.  This style can be set
explicitly to one of the usual `true\&' or `false' values as an override\&.

supplying different style settings for each attempt; see below for an
example\&.

As before, but \fBdescription\fP will replace the `\fB%d\fP\&' in

In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several
patterns in the form `\fB{\fP\fIpat1\fP\fB,\fP\fIpat2\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&'\&.  In this

for any given explicitly in the same string\&.
.PP
One use of these features is to try
one tag more than once, setting other styles differently on
each attempt, but still to use all the other tags without having to
repeat them all\&.  For example, to make completion of function names in
command position ignore all the completion functions starting with an
underscore the first time completion is tried:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:\-command\-:*:*' tag\-order \e

zstyle \&':completion:*:functions\-non\-comp' \e

.fi
.RE
.PP
On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the \fBfunctions\fP tag
will be replaced by \fBfunctions\-non\-comp\fP\&.  The \fBignored\-patterns\fP style 
is set for this tag to exclude functions starting with an underscore\&.
If there are no matches, the second value of the
\fBtag\-order\fP style is used which completes functions using the default
tag, this time presumably including all function names\&.
.PP
The matches for one tag can be split into different groups\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' tag\-order \e

With the \fBgroup\-names\fP style set, options beginning with

displayed in separate groups with different descriptions\&.
.PP
Another use of patterns is to
try multiple match specifications one after another\&.  The
\fBmatcher\-list\fP style offers something similar, but it is tested very
early in the completion system and hence can\&'t be set for single
commands nor for more specific contexts\&.  Here is how to
try normal completion without any match specification and, if that
generates no matches, try again with case\-insensitive matching, restricting
the effect to arguments of the command \fBfoo\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' tag\-order '*' '*:\-case'
zstyle \&':completion:*\-case' matcher 'm:{a\-z}={A\-Z}'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
First, all the tags offered when completing after \fBfoo\fP are tried using
the normal tag name\&.  If that generates no matches, the second value of
\fBtag\-order\fP is used, which tries all tags again except that this time
each has \fB\-case\fP appended to its name for lookup of styles\&.  Hence this
time the value for the \fBmatcher\fP style from the second call to \fBzstyle\fP
in the example is used to make completion case\-insensitive\&.
.PP
It is possible to use the \fB\-e\fP option of the \fBzstyle\fP builtin
command to specify conditions for the use of particular tags\&.  For
example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \-e \&'*:\-command\-:*' tag\-order '
    if [[ \-n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then
      reply=( )
    else

    fi\&'\fP

.RE
.PP
Completion in command position will be attempted only if the string
typed so far is not empty\&.  This is tested using the \fBPREFIX\fP
special parameter; see
zshcompwid
for a description of parameters which are special inside completion widgets\&.
Setting \fBreply\fP to an empty array provides the default
behaviour of trying all tags at once; setting it to an
array containing only a hyphen disables the use of all tags and hence of
all completions\&.
.PP
If no \fBtag\-order\fP style has been defined for a context, the strings
`\fB(|*\-)argument\-* (|*\-)option\-* values\fP\&' and `\fBoptions\fP' plus all
tags offered by the completion function will be used to provide a
sensible default behavior that causes arguments (whether normal command
arguments or arguments of options) to be completed before option names for
most commands\&.
.RE

\fBurls\fP
This is used together with the \fBurls\fP tag by
functions completing URLs\&.
.RS

Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the

`\fBdefault\fP\&' to use the completion defined with `\fBcompctl \-D\fP'\&.

there is no specific completion function for the command in question\&.  For
example, if there is a function \fB_foo\fP to complete arguments to the

.SH "CONTROL FUNCTIONS"
.PP
The initialization script \fBcompinit\fP redefines all the widgets
which perform completion to call the supplied widget function
\fB_main_complete\fP\&.  This function acts as a wrapper calling the
so\-called `completer\&' functions that generate matches\&.  If
\fB_main_complete\fP is called with arguments, these are taken as the
names of completer functions to be called in the order given\&.  If no
arguments are given, the set of functions to try is taken from the
\fBcompleter\fP style\&.  For example, to use normal completion and
correction if that doesn\&'t generate any matches:
.PP

after calling \fBcompinit\fP\&. The default value for this style is
`\fB_complete _ignored\fP\&', i\&.e\&. normally only ordinary completion is tried,
first with the effect of the \fBignored\-patterns\fP style and then without
it\&.  The \fB_main_complete\fP function uses the return status of the completer
functions to decide if other completers should be called\&.  If the return
status is zero, no other completers are tried and the \fB_main_complete\fP
function returns\&.
.PP
If the first argument to \fB_main_complete\fP is a single hyphen, the
arguments will not be taken as names of completers\&.  Instead, the
second argument gives a name to use in the \fIcompleter\fP field of the 
context and the other arguments give a command name and arguments to
call to generate the matches\&.
.PP
The following completer functions are contained in the distribution,

\fB_approximate\fP
This is similar to the basic \fB_complete\fP completer but allows the

This will give correcting completion if and only if
normal completion yields no possible completions\&.  When
corrected completions are found, the completer will normally start
menu completion allowing you to cycle through these strings\&.
.PP
This completer uses the tags \fBcorrections\fP and \fBoriginal\fP when
generating the possible corrections and the original string\&.  The
\fBformat\fP style for the former may contain the additional sequences
`\fB%e\fP\&' and `\fB%o\fP' which will be replaced by the number of errors
accepted to generate the corrections and the original string,
respectively\&.
.PP
The completer progressively increases the number of errors allowed up to
the limit by the \fBmax\-errors\fP style, hence if a completion is found
with one error, no completions with two errors will be shown, and so on\&.
It modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the number of
errors being tried: on the first try the completer field contains
`\fBapproximate\-1\fP\&', on the second try `\fBapproximate\-2\fP', and so on\&.
.PP
When \fB_approximate\fP is called from another function, the number of
errors to accept may be passed with the \fB\-a\fP option\&.  The argument

.PP
Note that this completer (and the \fB_correct\fP completer mentioned
below) can be quite expensive to call, especially when a large number
of errors are allowed\&.  One way to avoid this is to set up the
\fBcompleter\fP style using the \fB\-e\fP option to zstyle so that some
completers are only used when completion is attempted a second time on 
the same string, e\&.g\&.:

\fB_complete\fP
This completer generates all possible completions in a context\-sensitive

explained above and the current settings of all special parameters\&.
This gives the normal completion behaviour\&.
.RS
.PP
To complete arguments of commands, \fB_complete\fP uses the utility function
\fB_normal\fP, which is in turn responsible for finding the particular
function; it is described below\&.  Various contexts of the form
\fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP are handled specifically\&. These are all
mentioned above as possible arguments to the \fB#compdef\fP tag\&.
.PP
Before trying to find a function for a specific context, \fB_complete\fP 
checks if the parameter `\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set\&. Setting
`\fBcompcontext\fP\&' allows the usual completion dispatching to be
overridden which is useful in places such as a function that uses
\fBvared\fP for input\&. If it is set to an array, the elements are taken
to be the possible matches which will be completed using the tag
`\fBvalues\fP\&' and the description `\fBvalue\fP'\&. If it is set to an
associative array, the keys are used as the possible completions and
the values (if non\-empty) are used as descriptions for the matches\&.  If
`\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set to a string containing colons, it should be of
the form `\fItag\fP\fB:\fP\fIdescr\fP\fB:\fP\fIaction\fP\&'\&.  In this case the
\fItag\fP and \fIdescr\fP give the tag and description to use and the
\fIaction\fP indicates what should be completed in one of the forms
accepted by the \fB_arguments\fP utility function described below\&.
.PP
Finally, if `\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set to a string without colons, the
value is taken as the name of the context to use and the function
defined for that context will be called\&.  For this purpose, there is a
special context named \fB\-command\-line\-\fP that completes whole command
lines (commands and their arguments)\&.  This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly called\&.

correction will accept up to two errors\&.  If a numeric argument is

\fB_expand\fP
This completer function does not really perform completion, but instead
checks if the word on the command line is eligible for expansion and,

\fBcomplete\-word\fP, not \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP (the default binding for

\fB_user_expand\fP
This completer behaves similarly to the \fB_expand\fP completer but
instead performs expansions defined by users\&.  The styles \fBadd\-space\fP and
\fBsort\fP styles specific to the \fB_expand\fP completer are usable with
\fB_user_expand\fP in addition to other styles handled more generally by
the completion system\&.  The tag \fBall\-expansions\fP is also available\&.

The expansion depends on the array style \fBuser\-expand\fP being defined

specific than that for contextual completion as the full context has not
yet been determined\&.  Elements of the array may have one of the following
forms:

\fB$\fP\fIhash\fP

\fIhash\fP is the name of an associative array\&.  Note this is not a full
parameter expression, merely a \fB$\fP, suitably quoted to prevent immediate
expansion, followed by the name of an associative array\&.  If the trial
expansion word matches a key in \fIhash\fP, the resulting expansion is the
corresponding value\&.

\fI_func\fP

\fI_func\fP is the name of a shell function whose name must begin with

is called with the trial word as an argument\&.  If the word is to be
expanded, the function should set the array \fBreply\fP to a list of

be used as a description for the set of expansions\&.

In addition to the context\-dependent completions provided, which are

.PD
\fB_bash_completions\fP
This function is used by two widgets, \fB_bash_complete\-word\fP and
\fB_bash_list\-choices\fP\&.  It exists to provide compatibility with
completion bindings in bash\&.  The last character of the binding determines
what is completed: `\fB!\fP\&', command names; `\fB$\fP', environment variables;
`\fB@\fP\&', host names; `\fB/\fP', file names; `\fB~\fP' user names\&.  In bash, the
binding preceded by `\fB\ee\fP\&' gives completion, and preceded by `\fB^X\fP'
lists options\&.  As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh
bindings, only `\fB\ee~\fP\&' and `\fB^X~\fP' are bound by default\&.  To add the
rest, the following should be added to \fB\&.zshrc\fP after \fBcompinit\fP has
been run:

\fB_correct_filename\fP (\fB^XC\fP)
Correct the filename path at the cursor position\&.  Allows up to six errors

a filename path, independently of zle; the correction is printed on
standard output\&.
.TP
\fB_correct_word\fP (\fB^Xc\fP)
Performs correction of the current argument using the usual contextual
completions as possible choices\&. This stores the string
`\fBcorrect\-word\fP\&' in the \fIfunction\fP field of the context name and
then calls the \fB_correct\fP completer\&.
.TP
\fB_expand_alias\fP (\fB^Xa\fP)
This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable command\&.
It expands the word the cursor is on if it is an alias\&.  The types of
alias expanded can be controlled with the styles \fBregular\fP, \fBglobal\fP
and \fBdisabled\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature that
can be selected by setting the \fBcomplete\fP style to `true\&'\&.  In this
case, if the word is not the name of an alias, \fB_expand_alias\fP tries
to complete the word to a full alias name without expanding it\&.  It
leaves the cursor directly after the completed word so that invoking
\fB_expand_alias\fP once more will expand the now\-complete alias name\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_expand_word\fP (\fB^Xe\fP)
Performs expansion on the current word:  equivalent to the standard
\fBexpand\-word\fP command, but using the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  Before
calling it, the \fIfunction\fP field of the context is set to
`\fBexpand\-word\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fB_generic\fP
This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by
default\&.  However, it can be used to define a widget and will then
store the name of the widget in the \fIfunction\fP field of the context 
and call the completion system\&.  This allows custom completion widgets
with their own set of style settings to be defined easily\&.  For example, 
to define a widget that performs normal completion and starts
menu selection:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzle \-C foo complete\-word _generic
bindkey \&'\&.\&.\&.' foo
zstyle \&':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note in particular that the \fBcompleter\fP style may be set for the context
in order to change the set of functions used to generate possible matches\&.
If \fB_generic\fP is called with arguments, those are passed through to
\fB_main_complete\fP as the list of completers in place of those defined by
the \fBcompleter\fP style\&.
.RE

\fB_history_complete_word\fP (\fB\ee/\fP)

\fBlist\fP, \fBremove\-all\-dups\fP, \fBsort\fP, and \fBstop\fP styles\&.
.TP
\fB_most_recent_file\fP (\fB^Xm\fP)
Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching the pattern
on the command line (which may be blank)\&.  If given a numeric argument
\fIN\fP, complete the \fIN\fPth most recently modified file\&.  Note the
completion, if any, is always unique\&.
.TP
\fB_next_tags\fP (\fB^Xn\fP)
This command alters the set of matches used to that for the next tag, or
set of tags, either as given by the \fBtag\-order\fP style or as set by
default; these matches would otherwise not be available\&.
Successive invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets of
tags\&.
.TP
\fB_read_comp\fP (\fB^X^R\fP)
Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion on the
current word\&.  There are two possibilities for the string\&.  First, it can
be a set of words beginning `\fB_\fP\&', for example `\fB_files \-/\fP', in which
case the function with any arguments will be called to generate the
completions\&.  Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed
automatically (normal completion is not available at this point) until a
space is typed\&.
.RS
.PP
Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to
\fBcompadd\fP and should hence be an expression specifying what should
be completed\&.
.PP
A very restricted set of editing commands is available when reading the
string:  `\fBDEL\fP\&' and `\fB^H\fP' delete the last character; `\fB^U\fP' deletes
the line, and `\fB^C\fP\&' and `\fB^G\fP' abort the function, while `\fBRET\fP'
accepts the completion\&.  Note the string is used verbatim as a command
line, so arguments must be quoted in accordance with standard shell rules\&.
.PP
Once a string has been read, the next call to \fB_read_comp\fP will use the
existing string instead of reading a new one\&.  To force a new string to be
read, call \fB_read_comp\fP with a numeric argument\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_complete_debug\fP (\fB^X?\fP)
This widget performs ordinary completion, but captures in a temporary file
a trace of the shell commands executed by the completion system\&.  Each
completion attempt gets its own file\&.  A command to view each of these
files is pushed onto the editor buffer stack\&.
.TP
\fB_complete_help\fP (\fB^Xh\fP)
This widget displays information about the context names, 
the tags, and the completion functions used 
when completing at the current cursor position\&. If given a numeric
argument other than \fB1\fP (as in `\fBESC\-2 ^Xh\fP\&'), then the styles
used and the contexts for which they are used will be shown, too\&.

information available from the completion functions called, which in turn
is determined by the user\&'s own styles and other settings\&.

\fB_complete_help_generic\fP
Unlike other commands listed here, this must be created as a normal ZLE
widget rather than a completion widget (i\&.e\&. with \fBzle \-N\fP)\&.  It

widget that is described above\&.

If this widget is created using the name of the function, as it is by
default, then when executed it will read a key sequence\&.  This is expected
to be bound to a call to a completion function that uses the \fB_generic\fP
widget\&.  That widget will be executed, and information provided in
the same format that the \fB_complete_help\fP widget displays for
contextual completion\&.
.PP
If the widget\&'s name contains \fBdebug\fP, for example if it is created
as `\fBzle \-N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic\fP\&', it
will read and execute the keystring for a generic widget as before,
but then generate debugging information as done by \fB_complete_debug\fP
for contextual completion\&.
.PP
If the widget\&'s name contains \fBnoread\fP, it will not read a keystring
but instead arrange that the next use of a generic widget run in
the same shell will have the effect as described above\&.
.PP
The widget works by setting the shell parameter
\fBZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET\fP which is read by \fB_generic\fP\&.  Unsetting
the parameter cancels any pending effect of the \fBnoread\fP form\&.

bindkey \&'^x:' _complete_debug_generic\fP

programmes (note there is no connection with the completion system\&'s tags)
stored in a file \fBTAGS\fP, in the format used by \fBetags\fP, or \fBtags\fP, in the
format created by \fBctags\fP\&.  It will look back up the path hierarchy for
the first occurrence of either file; if both exist, the file \fBTAGS\fP is
preferred\&.  You can specify the full path to a \fBTAGS\fP or \fBtags\fP file by
setting the parameter \fB$TAGSFILE\fP or \fB$tagsfile\fP respectively\&.
The corresponding completion tags used are \fBetags\fP and \fBvtags\fP, after

.SH "UTILITY FUNCTIONS"

Descriptions follow for utility functions that may be
useful when writing completion functions\&.  If functions are installed in
subdirectories, most of these reside in the
\fBBase\fP subdirectory\&.  Like the example 
functions for commands in the distribution, the utility functions
generating matches all follow the convention of returning status zero if they
generated completions and non\-zero if no matching completions could be 
added\&.
.PP
Two more features are offered by the \fB_main_complete\fP function\&.  The
arrays \fBcompprefuncs\fP and \fBcomppostfuncs\fP may contain
names of functions that are to be called immediately before or after
completion has been tried\&.  A function will only be called once unless

This is a convenient interface to the \fB_next_label\fP function below,
implementing the loop shown in the \fB_next_label\fP example\&.  The
\fIcommand\fP and its arguments are called to generate the matches\&.  The
options stored in the parameter \fIname\fP will automatically be inserted

directly after the \fIcommand\fP, but if one of the \fIarg\fPs is a single
hyphen, they are inserted directly before that\&.  If the hyphen is the last
argument, it will be removed from the argument list before the
\fIcommand\fP is called\&.  This allows \fB_all_labels\fP to be used in almost all

by the \fB_arguments\fP function (described below), excluding the
`\fB\->\fP\fIstate\fP\&' and `\fB=\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP' forms\&.

For example, the \fIaction\fP may be a simple function call:

.fi
.RE
.PP
offers usernames and hostnames as possible matches,
generated by the \fB_users\fP and \fB_hosts\fP functions respectively\&.

Like \fB_arguments\fP, this function uses \fB_all_labels\fP to execute 
the actions, which will loop over all sets of tags\&.  Special handling is
only required if there is an additional valid tag, for example inside a
function called from \fB_alternative\fP\&.

Multiple colons are treated as for the `\fB*:\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' forms for

the \fBwords\fP special array and the \fBCURRENT\fP special parameter are

only to the words after the option\&.  When preceded by three colons, they

Any literal colon in an \fIoptname\fP, \fImessage\fP, or \fIaction\fP

Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in parentheses
of option names and argument numbers\&.  If the given option is on
the command line, the options and arguments indicated in parentheses
will not be offered\&.  For example, 
`\fB(\-two \-three 1)\-one:\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' completes the option `\fB\-one\fP'; if this
appears on the command line, the options \fB\-two\fP and \fB\-three\fP and the
first ordinary argument will not be completed after it\&.
`\fB(\-foo):\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' specifies an ordinary argument completion;
\fB\-foo\fP will not be completed if that argument is already present\&.
.PP
Other items may appear in the list of excluded options to indicate
various other items that should not be applied when the current
specification is matched: a single star (\fB*\fP) for the rest arguments
(i\&.e\&. a specification of the form `\fB*:\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'); a colon (\fB:\fP)
for all normal (non\-option\-) arguments; and a hyphen (\fB\-\fP) for all
options\&.  For example, if `\fB(*)\fP\&' appears before an option and the
option appears on the command line, the list of remaining arguments
(those shown in the above table beginning with `\fB*:\fP\&') will not be
completed\&.
.PP
To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to precede any of the
forms above with `\fB!\fP\&'; then the form will no longer be completed,
although if the option or argument appears on the command line they will
be skipped as normal\&.  The main use for this is when the arguments are
given by an array, and \fB_arguments\fP is called repeatedly for more
specific contexts: on the first call `\fB_arguments $global_options\fP\&' is
used, and on subsequent calls `\fB_arguments !$^global_options\fP\&'\&.
.PP
In each of the forms above the \fIaction\fP determines how
completions should be generated\&.  Except for the `\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&'
form below, the \fIaction\fP will be executed by calling the
\fB_all_labels\fP function to process all tag labels\&.  No special handling
of tags is needed unless a function call introduces a new one\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-O\fP \fIname\fP\&' specifies the name of an array whose elements

For example, this can be used to pass the same set of options for the
\fBcompadd\fP builtin to all \fIaction\fPs\&.

\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP
In this form, \fB_arguments\fP processes the arguments and options and then
returns control to the calling function with parameters set to indicate the
state of processing; the calling function then makes its own arrangements
for generating completions\&.  For example, functions that implement a state
machine can use this type of action\&.
.RS
.PP
Where \fB_arguments\fP encounters \fIaction\fP in the `\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&'
format, it will strip all leading and trailing whitespace from \fIstring\fP
and set the array \fBstate\fP to the set of all \fIstring\fPs for which an
action is to be performed\&.  The elements of the array \fBstate_descr\fP are
assigned the corresponding \fImessage\fP field from each \fIoptarg\fP
containing such an \fIaction\fP\&.
.PP
By default and in common with all other well behaved completion
functions, _arguments returns status zero if it was able to add matches and
non\-zero otherwise\&. However, if the \fB\-R\fP option is given,
\fB_arguments\fP will instead return a status of 300 to indicate that
\fB$state\fP is to be handled\&.
.PP
In addition to \fB$state\fP and \fB$state_descr\fP, \fB_arguments\fP also
sets the global
parameters `\fBcontext\fP\&', `\fBline\fP' and `\fBopt_args\fP' as described
below, and does not reset any changes made to the special parameters
such as \fBPREFIX\fP and \fBwords\fP\&.  This gives the calling function the
choice of resetting these parameters or propagating changes in them\&.
.PP
A function calling \fB_arguments\fP with at least
one action containing a `\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&' must therefore declare
appropriate local parameters:

.TP
\fB= \fP\fIaction\fP
If the \fIaction\fP starts with `\fB= \fP\&' (an equals sign followed by a
space), \fB_arguments\fP will insert the contents of the \fIargument\fP
field of the current context as the new first element in the \fBwords\fP 
special array and increment the value of the \fBCURRENT\fP special
parameter\&.  This has the effect of inserting a dummy word onto the
completion command line while not changing the point at which completion is
taking place\&.
.RS

This is most useful with one of the specifiers that restrict the words on
the command line on which the \fIaction\fP is to operate (the two\- and
three\-colon forms above)\&.  One particular use is when an \fIaction\fP itself
causes \fB_arguments\fP on a restricted range; it is necessary to use this
trick to insert an appropriate command name into the range for the second

Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings placed after the
first word; these are to be passed down as options to the \fBcompadd\fP
builtin\&.  They ensure that the state specified by \fB_arguments\fP, in
particular the descriptions of options and arguments, is correctly passed
to the completion command\&.  These additional arguments
are taken from the array parameter `\fBexpl\fP\&'; this will be set up
before executing the \fIaction\fP and hence may be referred to inside it,
typically in an expansion of the form `\fB$expl[@]\fP\&' which preserves empty
elements of the array\&.

During the performance of the action the array `\fBline\fP\&' will be set to
the normal arguments from the command line, i\&.e\&. the words from the
command line after the command name excluding all options and their
arguments\&.  Options are stored in the associative array
`\fBopt_args\fP\&' with option names as keys and their arguments as
the values\&.  For options that have more than one argument these are
given as one string, separated by colons\&.  All colons in the original
arguments are preceded with backslashes\&.
.PP
The parameter `\fBcontext\fP\&' is set when returning to the calling function
to perform an action of the form `\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&'\&.  It is set to an
array of elements corresponding to the elements of \fB$state\fP\&.  Each
element is a suitable name for the argument field of the context: either a
string of the form `\fBoption\fP\fI\-opt\fP\fB\-\fP\fIn\fP\&' for the \fIn\fP'th
argument of the option \fI\-opt\fP, or a string of the form
`\fBargument\-\fP\fIn\fP\&' for the \fIn\fP'th argument\&.  For `rest' arguments,
that is those in the list at the end not handled by position, \fIn\fP is the
string `\fBrest\fP\&'\&.  For example, when completing the argument of the \fB\-o\fP
option, the name is `\fBoption\-o\-1\fP\&', while for the second normal
(non\-option\-) argument it is `\fBargument\-2\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Furthermore, during the evaluation of the \fIaction\fP the context name in
the \fBcurcontext\fP parameter is altered to append the same string that is
stored in the \fBcontext\fP parameter\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-C\fP tells \fB_arguments\fP to modify the \fBcurcontext\fP
parameter for an action of the form `\fB\->\fP\fIstate\fP\&'\&.  This is the
standard parameter used to keep track of the current context\&.  Here it
(and not the \fBcontext\fP array) should be made local to the calling
function to avoid passing back the modified value and should be
initialised to the current value at the start of the function:

This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to be valid

It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and
arguments with the sets separated by single hyphens\&.  The specifications

The first word in every other set provides a name for the

either alone or before one of the possible values described above\&.
In the second case a `\fB\-\fP\&' should appear between this name and the
remainder\&.

This defines two sets\&.  When the command line contains the option
`\fB\-c\fP\&', the `\fB\-d\fP' option and the argument will not be considered
possible completions\&.  When it contains `\fB\-d\fP\&' or an argument, the
option `\fB\-c\fP\&' will not be considered\&.  However, after `\fB\-a\fP'
both sets will still be considered valid\&.
.PP
If the name given for one of the mutually exclusive sets is of the form
`\fB(\fP\fIname\fP\fB)\fP\&' then only one value from each set will ever
be completed; more formally, all specifications are mutually
exclusive to all other specifications in the same set\&.  This is
useful for defining multiple sets of options which are mutually
exclusive and in which the options are aliases for each other\&.  For
example:
.PP
.RS

As the completion code has to parse the command line separately for each
set this form of argument is slow and should only be used when necessary\&.
A useful alternative is often an option specification with rest\-arguments
(as in `\fB\-foo:*:\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'); here the option \fB\-foo\fP swallows up all
remaining arguments as described by the \fIoptarg\fP definitions\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' allows \fB_arguments\fP to work out the names of long
options that support the `\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' option which is standard in many
GNU commands\&.  The command word is called with the argument
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' and the output examined for option names\&.  Clearly, it can
be dangerous to pass this to commands which may not support this option as
the behaviour of the command is unspecified\&.
.PP
In addition to options, `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' will try to deduce the
types of arguments available for options when the form
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\fIopt\fP\fB=\fP\fIval\fP\&' is valid\&.  It is also possible to provide
hints by examining the help text of the command and adding \fIhelpspec\fP of
the form `\fIpattern\fP\fB:\fP\fImessage\fP\fB:\fP\fIaction\fP\&'; note that other
\fB_arguments\fP \fIspec\fP forms are not used\&.  The \fIpattern\fP is matched
against the help text for an option, and if it matches the \fImessage\fP and
\fIaction\fP are used as for other argument specifiers\&.  The special case
of `\fB*:\fP\&' means both \fImessage\fP and \fIaction\fP are empty, which has
the effect of causing options having no description in the help output to
be ordered in listings ahead of options that have a description\&.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \-\- \&'*\e*:toggle:(yes no)' \e 
              \&'*=FILE*:file:_files' \e 
              \&'*=DIR*:directory:_files \-/' \e 
              \&'*=PATH*:directory:_files \-/'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, `\fByes\fP\&' and `\fBno\fP' will be completed as the argument of
options whose description ends in a star; file names will be completed for
options that contain the substring `\fB=FILE\fP\&' in the description; and
directories will be completed for options whose description contains
`\fB=DIR\fP\&' or `\fB=PATH\fP'\&.  The last three are in fact the default and so
need not be given explicitly, although it is possible to override the use
of these patterns\&.  A typical help text which uses this feature is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB  \-C, \-\-directory=DIR          change to directory DIR\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
so that the above specifications will cause directories to be completed
after `\fB\-\fP\fB\-directory\fP\&', though not after `\fB\-C\fP'\&.
.PP
Note also that \fB_arguments\fP tries to find out automatically if the
argument for an option is optional\&.  This can be specified explicitly by
doubling the colon before the \fImessage\fP\&.
.PP
If the \fIpattern\fP ends in `\fB(\-)\fP\&', this will be removed from the
pattern and the \fIaction\fP will be used only directly after the
`\fB=\fP\&', not in the next word\&.  This is the behaviour of a normal
specification defined with the form `\fB=\-\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' can be followed by the option `\fB\-i\fP
\fIpatterns\fP\&' to give patterns for options which are not to be
completed\&.  The patterns can be given as the name of an array parameter
or as a literal list in parentheses\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \-\- \-i \e 
    "(\-\-(en|dis)able\-FEATURE*)"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will cause completion to ignore the options
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-enable\-FEATURE\fP\&' and `\fB\-\fP\fB\-disable\-FEATURE\fP' (this example is
useful with GNU \fBconfigure\fP)\&.
.PP
The `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' form can also be followed by the option `\fB\-s\fP
\fIpair\fP\&' to describe option aliases\&.  The \fIpair\fP consists of a list
of alternating patterns and corresponding replacements, enclosed in parens
and quoted so that it forms a single argument word in the \fB_arguments\fP
call\&.
.PP
For example, some \fBconfigure\fP\-script help output describes options only
as `\fB\-\fP\fB\-enable\-foo\fP\&', but the script also accepts the negated form
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-disable\-foo\fP\&'\&.  To allow completion of the second form:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \-\- \-s "((#s)\-\-enable\- \-\-disable\-)"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Finally, note that \fB_arguments\fP generally expects to be the primary
function handling any completion for which it is used\&.  It may have side
effects which change the treatment of any matches added by other functions
called after it\&.  To combine \fB_arguments\fP with other functions, those
functions should be called either before \fB_arguments\fP, as an \fIaction\fP
within a \fIspec\fP, or in handlers for `\fB\->\fP\fIstate\fP\&' actions\&.

Here is a more general example of the use of \fB_arguments\fP:

This describes three options: `\fB\-l\fP\&', `\fB\-format\fP', and
`\fB\-copy\fP\&'\&.  The first takes one argument described as `\fIleft
border\fP\&' for which no completion will be offered because of the empty
action\&.  Its argument may come directly after the `\fB\-l\fP\&' or it may be 
given as the next word on the line\&.

The `\fB\-format\fP\&' option takes one
argument in the next word, described as `\fIpaper size\fP\&' for which
only the strings `\fBletter\fP\&' and `\fBA4\fP' will be completed\&.

The `\fB\-copy\fP\&' option may appear more than once on the command line and
takes two arguments\&.  The first is mandatory and will be completed as a

the description `\fIresolution\fP\&') and will be completed from the strings
`\fB300\fP\&' and `\fB600\fP'\&.

The last two descriptions say what should be completed as
arguments\&.  The first describes the first argument as a

\fB_description\fP [ \fB\-x\fP ] [ \fB\-12VJ\fP ] \fItag\fP \fIname\fP \fIdescr\fP [ \fIspec\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This function is not to be confused with the previous one; it is used as
a helper function for creating options to \fBcompadd\fP\&.  It is buried
inside many of the higher level completion functions and so often does
not need to be called directly\&.
.RS
.PP
The styles listed below are tested in the current context using the
given \fItag\fP\&.  The resulting options for \fBcompadd\fP are put into the
array named \fIname\fP (this is traditionally `\fBexpl\fP\&', but this
convention is not enforced)\&.  The description for the corresponding set
of matches is passed to the function in \fIdescr\fP\&.
.PP
The styles tested are: \fBformat\fP, \fBhidden\fP, \fBmatcher\fP,
\fBignored\-patterns\fP and \fBgroup\-name\fP\&.  The \fBformat\fP style is first
tested for the given \fItag\fP and then for the \fBdescriptions\fP tag if
no value was found, while the remainder are only tested for the tag
given as the first argument\&.  The function also calls \fB_setup\fP
which tests some more styles\&.
.PP
The string returned by the \fBformat\fP style (if any) will be modified so
that the sequence `\fB%d\fP\&' is replaced by the \fIdescr\fP given as the third
argument without any leading or trailing white space\&.  If, after
removing the white space, the \fIdescr\fP is the empty string, the format
style will not be used and the options put into the \fIname\fP array will
not contain an explanation string to be displayed above the matches\&.
.PP
If \fB_description\fP is called with more than three arguments,
the additional \fIspec\fPs should be of the form `\fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstr\fP\&'\&.
These supply escape sequence replacements for the \fBformat\fP style:
every appearance of `\fB%\fP\fIchar\fP\&' will be
replaced by \fIstring\fP\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-x\fP option is given, the description will be passed to
\fBcompadd\fP using the \fB\-x\fP option instead of the default \fB\-X\fP\&.  This
means that the description will be displayed even if there are no
corresponding matches\&.
.PP
The options placed in the array \fIname\fP take account of the
\fBgroup\-name\fP style, so matches are placed in a separate group where
necessary\&.  The group normally has its elements sorted (by passing the
option \fB\-J\fP to \fBcompadd\fP), but if an option starting with `\fB\-V\fP\&',
`\fB\-J\fP\&', `\fB\-1\fP', or `\fB\-2\fP' is passed to \fB_description\fP, that
option will be included in the array\&.  Hence it is possible for the
completion group to be unsorted by giving the option `\fB\-V\fP\&',
`\fB\-1V\fP\&', or `\fB\-2V\fP'\&.

In most cases, the function will be used like this:

Note the use of the parameter \fBexpl\fP, the hyphen, and the list of

This sets the current context to \fIcontext\fP and looks for completion
functions to handle this context by hunting through the list of command

given as \fIstring\fPs\&.  The first completion function to be defined
for one of the contexts in the list is used to generate matches\&.
Typically, the last \fIstring\fP is \fB\-default\-\fP to cause the function

generated\&.  This is useful for displaying a help message in places where

If the \fB\-r\fP option is given, no style is used; the \fIdescr\fP is
taken literally as the string to display\&.  This is most useful

option specification\&.  The tag can be omitted and if so the tag is taken
from the parameter \fB$curtag\fP; this is maintained by the completion

additional matches generated later are not inserted on the command line\&.

`\fB(foo bar\fP\fB)\fP\&', a parenthesised list of words separated
by whitespace\&.  The possible completions are the
strings from the array\&.  However, each chunk delimited by \fIsep\fP will be
completed separately\&.  For example, the \fB_tar\fP function uses
`\fB_multi_parts\fP \fB/\fP \fIpatharray\fP\&' to complete partial file paths
from the given array of complete file paths\&.
.RS

The \fB\-i\fP option causes \fB_multi_parts\fP to insert a unique match even

the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain other types of

more suited to this form\&.

A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the \fB$words\fP

For example, the function \fB_precommand\fP, which
completes after pre\-command specifiers such as \fBnohup\fP, removes the
first word from the \fBwords\fP array, decrements the \fBCURRENT\fP parameter,

This function is called to decide whether a tag already registered by a

\fB_store_cache\fP \fIcache_identifier\fP \fIparam\fP \&.\&.\&.
This function, together with \fB_retrieve_cache\fP and

in any completion function\&.  Data obtained by
costly operations are stored in parameters;
this function then dumps the values of those parameters to a file\&.  The
data can then be retrieved quickly from that file via \fB_retrieve_cache\fP,
even in different instances of the shell\&.

The \fIcache_identifier\fP specifies the file which the data should be
dumped to\&.  The file is stored in a directory specified by the

The return status is zero if storage was successful\&.  The function will

The completion function may avoid calling \fB_retrieve_cache\fP when it

Next, \fB_tags\fP is called repeatedly without arguments from the same

If the first argument is the option `\fB\-O\fP \fIname\fP\&', it will be used

.PP
If the first argument (or the first argument after `\fB\-O\fP \fIname\fP\&')
is `\fB\-s\fP\&', the next argument is used as the character that separates
multiple values\&.  This character is automatically added after each value
in an auto\-removable fashion (see below); all values completed by
`\fB_values \-s\fP\&' appear in the same word on the command line, unlike
completion using \fB_arguments\fP\&.  If this option is not present, only a
single value will be completed per word\&.
.PP
Normally, \fB_values\fP will only use the current word to determine
which values are already present on the command line and hence are not
to be completed again\&.  If the \fB\-w\fP option is given, other arguments
are examined as well\&.
.PP
The first non\-option argument is used as a string to print as a
description before listing the values\&.
.PP
All other arguments describe the possible values and their
arguments in the same format used for the description of options by
the \fB_arguments\fP function (see above)\&.  The only differences are that
no minus or plus sign is required at the beginning,
values can have only one argument, and the forms of action
beginning with an equal sign are not supported\&.
.PP
The character separating a value from its argument can be set using the
option \fB\-S\fP (like \fB\-s\fP, followed by the character to use as the

`\fBnumber\fP\&', may appear more than once, and takes one mandatory
argument described as `\fBfirst count\fP\&'; no action is
specified, so it will not be completed\&.  The
`\fB(two)\fP\&' at the beginning says that if the value `\fBone\fP' is on
the line, the value `\fBtwo\fP\&' will no longer be considered a possible
completion\&.  Finally, the last value (`\fBtwo\fP\&') is described
as `\fBanother number\fP\&' and takes an optional argument described as
`\fBsecond count\fP\&' for which the completions (to appear after an

will complete lists of these values separated by commas\&.
.PP
Like \fB_arguments\fP, this function temporarily adds another context name
component to the arguments element (the fifth) of the current context
while executing the \fIaction\fP\&.  Here this name is just the name of the

The style \fBverbose\fP is used to decide if the descriptions for the

The associative array \fBval_args\fP is used to report values and their
arguments; this works similarly to the \fBopt_args\fP associative array
used by \fB_arguments\fP\&.  Hence the function calling \fB_values\fP should
declare the local parameters \fBstate\fP, \fBstate_descr\fP, \fBline\fP,

the \fBstate\fP and \fBstate_descr\fP are scalars rather than arrays\&.
Only a single matching state is returned\&.
.PP
Note also that \fB_values\fP normally adds the character used as the
separator between values as an auto\-removable suffix (similar to a
`\fB/\fP\&' after a directory)\&.  However, this is not possible for a
`\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&' action as the matches for the argument are
generated by the calling function\&.  To get the usual behaviour,
the calling function can add the separator \fIx\fP as a suffix by
passing the options `\fB\-qS\fP \fIx\fP\&' either directly or indirectly to
\fBcompadd\fP\&.

The shell\&'s programmable completion mechanism can be manipulated in two
ways; here the low\-level features supporting the newer, function\-based
mechanism are defined\&.  A complete set of shell functions based on these
features is described in
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1),
and users with no interest in adding to that system (or, potentially,
writing their own \-\- see dictionary entry for `hubris\&') should skip
the current section\&.  The older system based on the \fBcompctl\fP builtin
command is described in
\fIzshcompctl\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Completion widgets are defined by the \fB\-C\fP option to the \fBzle\fP
builtin command provided by the \fBzsh/zle\fP module (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&. For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf

defines a widget named `\fBcomplete\fP\&'\&.  The second argument is the name
of any of the builtin widgets that handle completions:
\fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP,
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBmenu\-complete\fP,
\fBmenu\-expand\-or\-complete\fP, \fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP,
\fBlist\-choices\fP, or \fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP\&.  Note that this will still
work even if the widget in question has been re\-bound\&.
.PP
When this newly defined widget is bound to a key
using the \fBbindkey\fP builtin command defined in the \fBzsh/zle\fP module
(see \fIzshzle\fP(1)), typing that key will call the shell function `\fBcompleter\fP\&'\&. This
function is responsible for generating the possible matches using the
builtins described below\&.  As with other ZLE widgets, the function is
called with its standard input closed\&.
.PP
Once the function returns, the completion code takes over control again
and treats the matches in the same manner as the specified builtin
widget, in this case \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP\&.

.SH "COMPLETION SPECIAL PARAMETERS"

The parameters \fBZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS\fP and \fBZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS\fP

.PP
Inside completion widgets, and any functions called from them, some
parameters have special meaning; outside these functions they are not
special to the shell in any way\&.  These parameters are used to pass
information between the completion code and the completion widget\&. Some of
the builtin commands and the condition codes use or change the current
values of these parameters\&.  Any existing values will be hidden during
execution of completion widgets; except for \fBcompstate\fP, the parameters
are reset on each function exit (including nested function calls from
within the completion widget) to the values they had when the function was
entered\&.

set to \fBaccept\fP if an exact match would be accepted, and will be unset
otherwise\&.

If it was set when at least one match equal to the string on the line

\fBexact_string\fP
The string of an exact match if one was found, otherwise unset\&.
.TP
\fBignored\fP
The number of words that were ignored because they matched one of the
patterns given with the \fB\-F\fP option to the \fBcompadd\fP builtin
command\&.
.TP
\fBinsert\fP
This controls the manner in which a match is inserted into the command
line\&.  On entry to the widget function, if it is unset the command line is
not to be changed; if set to \fBunambiguous\fP, any prefix common to all
matches is to be inserted; if set to \fBautomenu\-unambiguous\fP, the
common prefix is to be inserted and the next invocation of the
completion code may start menu completion (due to the \fBAUTO_MENU\fP
option being set); if set to \fBmenu\fP or \fBautomenu\fP menu completion
will be started for the matches currently generated (in the
latter case this will happen because the \fBAUTO_MENU\fP is set)\&. The
value may also contain the string `\fBtab\fP\&' when the completion code
would normally not really do completion, but only insert the TAB
character\&.
.RS
.PP
On exit it may be set to any of the values above (where setting it to
the empty string is the same as unsetting it), or to a number, in which
case the match whose number is given will be inserted into the command line\&.
Negative numbers count backward from the last match (with `\fB\-1\fP\&'
selecting the last match) and out\-of\-range values are wrapped
around, so that a value of zero selects the last match and a value
one more than the maximum selects the first\&. Unless the value of this
key ends in a space, the match is inserted as in a menu completion,
i\&.e\&. without automatically appending a space\&.
.PP
Both \fBmenu\fP and \fBautomenu\fP may also specify the number of the
match to insert, given after a colon\&.  For example, `\fBmenu:2\fP\&' says
to start menu completion, beginning with the second match\&.
.PP
Note that a value containing the substring `\fBtab\fP\&' makes the
matches generated be ignored and only the TAB be inserted\&.
.PP
Finally, it may also be set to \fBall\fP, which makes all matches
generated be inserted into the line\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBinsert_positions\fP
When the completion system inserts an unambiguous string into the
line, there may be multiple places where characters are missing or
where the character inserted differs from at least one match\&.  The
value of this key contains a colon separated list of all these
positions, as indexes into the command line\&.
.TP
\fBlast_prompt\fP
If this is set to a non\-empty string for every match added, the
completion code will move the cursor back to the previous prompt after
the list of completions has been displayed\&.  Initially this is set or
unset according to the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option\&.
.TP
\fBlist\fP
This controls whether or how the list of matches will be displayed\&.  If it
is unset or empty they will never be listed; if its value begins with
\fBlist\fP, they will always be listed; if it begins with \fBautolist\fP
or \fBambiguous\fP, they will be listed when the \fBAUTO_LIST\fP or
\fBLIST_AMBIGUOUS\fP options respectively would normally cause them to
be\&.
.RS
.PP
If the substring \fBforce\fP appears in the value, this makes the
list be shown even if there is only one match\&. Normally, the list
would be shown only if there are at least two matches\&.
.PP
The value contains the substring \fBpacked\fP if the \fBLIST_PACKED\fP
option is set\&. If this substring is given for all matches added to a
group, this group will show the \fBLIST_PACKED\fP behavior\&. The same is
done for the \fBLIST_ROWS_FIRST\fP option with the substring \fBrows\fP\&.
.PP
Finally, if the value contains the string \fBexplanations\fP, only the
explanation strings, if any, will be listed and if it contains
\fBmessages\fP, only the messages (added with the \fB\-x\fP option of
\fBcompadd\fP) will be listed\&.  If it contains both \fBexplanations\fP and
\fBmessages\fP both kinds of explanation strings will be listed\&.  It
will be set appropriately on entry to a completion widget and may be
changed there\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBlist_lines\fP
This gives the number of lines that are needed to display the full
list of completions\&.  Note that to calculate the total number of lines
to display you need to add the number of lines needed for the command
line to this value, this is available as the value of the \fBBUFFERLINES\fP
special parameter\&.
.TP
\fBlist_max\fP
Initially this is set to the value of the \fBLISTMAX\fP parameter\&.
It may be set to any other value; when the widget exits this value
will be used in the same way as the value of \fBLISTMAX\fP\&.
.TP
\fBnmatches\fP
The number of matches generated and accepted by the completion code so
far\&.
.TP
\fBold_insert\fP
On entry to the widget this will be set to the number of the match of
an old list of completions that is currently inserted into the command
line\&. If no match has been inserted, this is unset\&.
.RS
.PP
As with \fBold_list\fP, the value of this key will only be used if it is the
string \fBkeep\fP\&. If it was set to this value by the widget and there was an
old match inserted into the command line, this match will be kept and if
the value of the \fBinsert\fP key specifies that another match should be
inserted, this will be inserted after the old one\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBold_list\fP
This is set to \fByes\fP if there is still a valid list of completions
from a previous completion at the time the widget is invoked\&.  This will
usually be the case if and only if the previous editing operation was a
completion widget or one of the builtin completion functions\&.  If there is a
valid list and it is also currently shown on the screen, the value of this
key is \fBshown\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
After the widget has exited the value of this key is only used if it
was set to \fBkeep\fP\&.  In this case the completion code will continue
to use this old list\&.  If the widget generated new matches, they will
not be used\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBparameter\fP
The name of the parameter when completing in a subscript or in the
value of a parameter assignment\&.
.TP
\fBpattern_insert\fP
Normally this is set to \fBmenu\fP, which specifies that menu completion will
be used whenever a set of matches was generated using pattern matching\&.  If
it is set to any other non\-empty string by the user and menu completion is
not selected by other option settings, the code will instead insert any
common prefix for the generated matches as with normal completion\&.
.TP
\fBpattern_match\fP
Locally controls the behaviour given by the \fBGLOB_COMPLETE\fP option\&.
Initially it is set to `\fB*\fP\&' if and only if the option is set\&.
The completion widget may set it to this value, to an empty string
(which has the same effect as unsetting it), or to any
other non\-empty string\&.  If it is non\-empty, unquoted metacharacters on the
command line will be treated as patterns; if it is `\fB*\fP\&', then
additionally a wildcard `\fB*\fP\&' is assumed at the cursor position; if
it is empty or unset, metacharacters will be treated literally\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that the matcher specifications given to the \fBcompadd\fP builtin
command are not used if this is set to a non\-empty string\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBquote\fP
When completing inside quotes, this contains the quotation character
(i\&.e\&. either a single quote, a double quote, or a backtick)\&.  Otherwise it
is unset\&.
.TP
\fBquoting\fP
When completing inside single quotes, this is set to the string
\fBsingle\fP; inside double quotes, the string
\fBdouble\fP; inside backticks, the string \fBbacktick\fP\&.
Otherwise it is unset\&.
.TP
\fBredirect\fP
The redirection operator when completing in a redirection position,
i\&.e\&. one of \fB<\fP, \fB>\fP, etc\&.
.TP
\fBrestore\fP
This is set to \fBauto\fP before a function is entered, which forces the
special parameters mentioned above (\fBwords\fP, \fBCURRENT\fP, \fBPREFIX\fP,
\fBIPREFIX\fP, \fBSUFFIX\fP, and \fBISUFFIX\fP) to be restored to their
previous values when the function exits\&.   If a function unsets it or
sets it to any other string, they will not be restored\&.
.TP
\fBto_end\fP
Specifies the occasions on which the cursor is moved to the end of a string
when a match is inserted\&.  On entry to a widget function, it may be
\fBsingle\fP if this will happen when a single unambiguous match was inserted
or \fBmatch\fP if it will happen any time a match is inserted (for example,
by menu completion; this is likely to be the effect of the \fBALWAYS_TO_END\fP
option)\&.
.RS
.PP
On exit, it may be set to \fBsingle\fP as above\&.  It may also be set to
\fBalways\fP, or to the empty string or unset; in those cases the cursor will
be moved to the end of the string always or never respectively\&.  Any
other string is treated as \fBmatch\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBunambiguous\fP
This key is read\-only and will always be set to the common (unambiguous)
prefix the completion code has generated for all matches added so far\&.
.TP
\fBunambiguous_cursor\fP
This gives the position the cursor would be placed at if the
common prefix in the \fBunambiguous\fP key were inserted, relative to

.TP
\fBunambiguous_positions\fP

The first field

given with the \fB\-P\fP option\&.  The \fI<hpre>\fP field is a string
that is considered part of the match but that should not be shown when 
listing completions, given with the \fB\-p\fP option; for example,

.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIsuffix\fP
Like \fB\-P\fP, but gives a string to be inserted after the match\&.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIhidden\-prefix\fP
This gives a string that should be inserted into the command line before the

on the command line\&.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIhidden\-suffix\fP

\fB\-i\fP \fIignored\-prefix\fP

.TP
\fB\-I\fP \fIignored\-suffix\fP
Like \fB\-i\fP, but gives an ignored suffix\&.

\fB\-a\fP
With this flag the \fIwords\fP are taken as names of arrays and the
possible matches are their values\&.  If only some elements of the
arrays are needed, the \fIwords\fP may also contain subscripts, as in
`\fBfoo[2,\-1]\fP\&'\&.

space than groups created with the \fB\-J\fP flag\&.

\fB\-1\fP
If given together with the \fB\-V\fP option, makes
only consecutive duplicates in the group be removed\&. If combined with
the \fB\-J\fP option, this has no visible effect\&. Note that groups

\fB\-q\fP
The suffix given with \fB\-S\fP will be automatically removed if 
the next character typed is a blank or does not insert anything, or if
the suffix consists of only one character and the next character typed 
is the same character\&.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIremove\-chars\fP
This is a more versatile form of the \fB\-q\fP option\&.
The suffix given with \fB\-S\fP or the slash automatically added after
completing directories will be automatically removed if
the next character typed inserts one of the characters given in the
\fIremove\-chars\fP\&.  This string is parsed as a characters class and
understands the backslash sequences used by the \fBprint\fP command\&.  For
example, `\fB\-r "a\-z\et"\fP\&' removes the suffix if the next character typed
inserts a lower case character or a TAB, and `\fB\-r "^0\-9"\fP\&' removes the
suffix if the next character typed inserts anything but a digit\&. One extra
backslash sequence is understood in this string: `\fB\e\-\fP\&' stands for
all characters that insert nothing\&. Thus `\fB\-S "=" \-q\fP\&' is the same
as `\fB\-S "=" \-r "= \et\en\e\-"\fP\&'\&.
.RS
.PP
This option may also be used without the \fB\-S\fP option; then any
automatically added space will be removed when one of the characters in the
list is typed\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-R\fP \fIremove\-func\fP
This is another form of the \fB\-r\fP option\&. When a suffix 
has been inserted and the completion accepted, the function
\fIremove\-func\fP will be called after the next character typed\&.  It is
passed the length of the suffix as an argument and can use the special
parameters available in ordinary (non\-completion) zle widgets (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1)) to analyse and modify the command line\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
If this flag is given, all of the matches built from \fIwords\fP are
marked as being the names of files\&.  They are not required to be actual
filenames, but if they are, and the option \fBLIST_TYPES\fP is set, the
characters describing the types of the files in the completion lists will
be shown\&. This also forces a slash to be added when the name of a
directory is completed\&.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
This flag can be used to tell the completion code that the matches
added are parameter names for a parameter expansion\&. This will make
the \fBAUTO_PARAM_SLASH\fP and \fBAUTO_PARAM_KEYS\fP options be used for
the matches\&.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP \fIfile\-prefix\fP
This string is a pathname that will be
prepended to each of the matches formed by the given \fIwords\fP together 
with any prefix specified by the \fB\-p\fP option to form a complete filename
for testing\&.  Hence it is only useful if combined with the \fB\-f\fP flag, as
the tests will not otherwise be performed\&.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP \fIarray\fP
Specifies an array containing patterns\&. Words matching one of these
patterns are ignored, i\&.e\&. not considered to be possible matches\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIarray\fP may be the name of an array parameter or a list of
literal patterns enclosed in parentheses and quoted, as in `\fB\-F "(*?\&.o
*?\&.h)"\fP\&'\&. If the name of an array is given, the elements of the array are

\fB\-Q\fP
This flag instructs the completion 
code not to quote any metacharacters in the words when inserting them

\fB\-M\fP \fImatch\-spec\fP
This gives local match specifications as described below in
the section `Completion Matching Control\&'\&. This option may be given more than once\&.
In this case all \fImatch\-spec\fPs given are concatenated with spaces
between them to form the specification string to use\&.
Note that they will only be used if the \fB\-U\fP option is not given\&.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Specifies that the words added are to be used as possible
matches, but are not to appear in the completion listing\&.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP
If this flag is given, all words given will be accepted and no matching
will be done by the completion code\&. Normally this is used in
functions that do the matching themselves\&.
.TP
\fB\-O\fP \fIarray\fP
If this option is given, the \fIwords\fP are \fInot\fP added to the set of
possible completions\&.  Instead, matching is done as usual and all of the
\fIwords\fP given as arguments that match the string on the command line
will be stored in the array parameter whose name is given as \fIarray\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP \fIarray\fP
As the \fB\-O\fP option, except that instead of those of the \fIwords\fP which
match being stored in \fIarray\fP, the strings generated internally by the
completion code are stored\&. For example,
with a matching specification of `\fB\-M "L:|no="\fP\&', the string `\fBnof\fP'
on the command line and the string `\fBfoo\fP\&' as one of the \fIwords\fP, this
option stores the string `\fBnofoo\fP\&' in the array, whereas the \fB\-O\fP
option stores the `\fBfoo\fP\&' originally given\&.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fIarray\fP
As with \fB\-O\fP, the \fIwords\fP are not added to the set of possible
completions\&.  Instead, the completion code tests whether each \fIword\fP 
in turn matches what is on the line\&.  If the \fIn\fPth \fIword\fP does not
match, the \fIn\fPth element of the \fIarray\fP is removed\&.  Elements
for which the corresponding \fIword\fP is matched are retained\&.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
This option adds a special match which expands to all other matches
when inserted into the line, even those that are added after this
option is used\&.  Together with the \fB\-d\fP option it is possible to
specify a string that should be displayed in the list for this special 
match\&.  If no string is given, it will be shown as a string containing 
the strings that would be inserted for the other matches, truncated to 
the width of the screen\&.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP \fInumber\fP
This option adds \fInumber\fP empty matches after the \fIwords\fP have
been added\&.  An empty match takes up space in completion listings but
will never be inserted in the line and can\&'t be selected with menu
completion or menu selection\&.  This makes empty matches only useful to
format completion lists and to make explanatory string be shown in
completion lists (since empty matches can be given display strings
with the \fB\-d\fP option)\&.  And because all but one empty string would
otherwise be removed, this option implies the \fB\-V\fP and \fB\-2\fP

.SH "COMPLETION MATCHING CONTROL"
.PP
It is possible by use of the
\fB\-M\fP option of the \fBcompadd\fP builtin command to specify how the
characters in the string to be completed (referred to here as the
command line) map onto the characters in the list of matches produced by
the completion code (referred to here as the trial completions)\&. Note
that this is not used if the command line contains a glob pattern and
the \fBGLOB_COMPLETE\fP option is set or the \fBpattern_match\fP of the
\fBcompstate\fP special association is set to a non\-empty string\&.
.PP
The \fImatch\-spec\fP given as the argument to the \fB\-M\fP option (see
`Completion Builtin Commands\&' above) consists of one or more matching descriptions separated by
whitespace\&.  Each description consists of a letter followed by a colon
and then the patterns describing which character sequences on the line match
which character sequences in the trial completion\&.  Any sequence of
characters not handled in this fashion must match exactly, as usual\&.
.PP
The forms of \fImatch\-spec\fP understood are as follows\&. In each case, the
form with an upper case initial character retains the string already
typed on the command line as the final result of completion, while with
a lower case initial character the string on the command line is changed
into the corresponding part of the trial completion\&.

trial completion strings\&.

line and trial completion patterns are anchored on the right side\&.
Here an empty \fIranchor\fP and the \fBe\fP and \fBE\fP forms force the
match to the end of the trial completion or command line string\&.
.PP
Each \fIlpat\fP, \fItpat\fP or \fIanchor\fP is either an empty string or
consists of a sequence of literal characters (which may be quoted with a
backslash), question marks, character classes, and correspondence
classes; ordinary shell patterns are not used\&.  Literal characters match
only themselves, question marks match any character, and character
classes are formed as for globbing and match any character in the given
set\&.
.PP
Correspondence classes are defined like character classes, but with two
differences: they are delimited by a pair of braces, and negated classes
are not allowed, so the characters \fB!\fP and \fB^\fP have no special
meaning directly after the opening brace\&.  They indicate that a range of
characters on the line match a range of characters in the trial
completion, but (unlike ordinary character classes) paired according to
the corresponding position in the sequence\&.  For example, to make any
ASCII lower case letter on the line match the corresponding upper case
letter in the trial completion, you can use `\fBm:{a\-z}={A\-Z}\fP\&'
(however, see below for the recommended form for this)\&.  More
than one pair of classes can occur, in which case the first class before
the \fB=\fP corresponds to the first after it, and so on\&.  If one side has
more such classes than the other side, the superfluous classes behave
like normal character classes\&.  In anchor patterns correspondence classes
also behave like normal character classes\&.
.PP
The standard `\fB[:\fP\fIname\fP\fB:]\fP\&' forms described for standard shell
patterns (see
the section FILENAME GENERATION in \fIzshexpn\fP(1))
may appear in correspondence classes as well as normal character
classes\&.  The only special behaviour in correspondence classes is if
the form on the left and the form on the right are each one of
\fB[:upper:]\fP, \fB[:lower:]\fP\&.  In these cases the
character in the word and the character on the line must be the same up
to a difference in case\&.  Hence to make any lower case character on the
line match the corresponding upper case character in the trial
completion you can use `\fBm:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}\fP\&'\&.  Although the
matching system does not yet handle multibyte characters, this is likely
to be a future extension, at which point this syntax will handle
arbitrary alphabets; hence this form, rather than the use of explicit
ranges, is the recommended form\&.  In other cases
`\fB[:\fP\fIname\fP\fB:]\fP\&' forms are allowed\&.  If the two forms on the left
and right are the same, the characters must match exactly\&.  In remaining
cases, the corresponding tests are applied to both characters, but they
are not otherwise constrained; any matching character in one set goes
with any matching character in the other set:  this is equivalent to the
behaviour of ordinary character classes\&.
.PP
The pattern \fItpat\fP may also be one or two stars, `\fB*\fP\&' or
`\fB**\fP\&'\&. This means that the pattern on the command line can match
any number of characters in the trial completion\&. In this case the
pattern must be anchored (on either side); in the case of a single
star, the \fIanchor\fP then determines how much of the trial completion
is to be included \-\- only the characters up to the next appearance of
the anchor will be matched\&. With two stars, substrings matched by the
anchor can be matched, too\&.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
The keys of the \fBoptions\fP association defined by the \fBparameter\fP
module are the option names in all\-lower\-case form, without
underscores, and without the optional \fBno\fP at the beginning even
though the builtins \fBsetopt\fP and \fBunsetopt\fP understand option names
with upper case letters, underscores, and the optional \fBno\fP\&.  The
following alters the matching rules so that the prefix \fBno\fP and any
underscore are ignored when trying to match the trial completions
generated and upper case letters on the line match the corresponding
lower case letters in the words:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'L:|[nN][oO]= M:_= M:{[:upper:]}={[:lower:]}' \- \e 
  ${(k)options} \fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The first part says that the pattern `\fB[nN][oO]\fP\&' at the beginning
(the empty anchor before the pipe symbol) of the string on the
line matches the empty string in the list of words generated by
completion, so it will be ignored if present\&. The second part does the
same for an underscore anywhere in the command line string, and the
third part uses correspondence classes so that any
upper case letter on the line matches the corresponding lower case
letter in the word\&. The use of the upper case forms of the
specification characters (\fBL\fP and \fBM\fP) guarantees that what has
already been typed on the command line (in particular the prefix
\fBno\fP) will not be deleted\&.
.PP
Note that the use of \fBL\fP in the first part means that it matches
only when at the beginning of both the command line string and the
trial completion\&. I\&.e\&., the string `\fB_NO_f\fP\&' would not be
completed to `\fB_NO_foo\fP\&', nor would `\fBNONO_f\fP' be completed to
`\fBNONO_foo\fP\&' because of the leading underscore or the second
`\fBNO\fP\&' on the line which makes the pattern fail even though they are 
otherwise ignored\&. To fix this, one would use `\fBB:[nN][oO]=\fP\&'
instead of the first part\&. As described above, this matches at the
beginning of the trial completion, independent of other characters or
substrings at the beginning of the command line word which are ignored
by the same or other \fImatch\-spec\fPs\&.
.PP
The second example makes completion case insensitive\&.  This is just
the same as in the option example, except here we wish to retain the
characters in the list of completions:
.PP

.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'m:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}' \&.\&.\&. \fP

.RE
.PP
A nice example for the use of \fB*\fP patterns is partial word
completion\&. Sometimes you would like to make strings like `\fBc\&.s\&.u\fP\&'
complete to strings like `\fBcomp\&.source\&.unix\fP\&', i\&.e\&. the word on the
command line consists of multiple parts, separated by a dot in this
example, where each part should be completed separately \-\- note,
however, that the case where each part of the word, i\&.e\&. `\fBcomp\fP\&',
`\fBsource\fP\&' and `\fBunix\fP' in this example, is to be completed from
separate sets of matches
is a different problem to be solved by the implementation of the
completion widget\&.  The example can be handled by:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'r:|\&.=* r:|=*' \e 
  \- comp\&.sources\&.unix comp\&.sources\&.misc \&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The first specification says that \fIlpat\fP is the empty string, while
\fIanchor\fP is a dot; \fItpat\fP is \fB*\fP, so this can match anything
except for the `\fB\&.\fP\&' from the anchor in
the trial completion word\&.  So in `\fBc\&.s\&.u\fP\&', the matcher sees `\fBc\fP',
followed by the empty string, followed by the anchor `\fB\&.\fP\&', and
likewise for the second dot, and replaces the empty strings before the
anchors, giving `\fBc\fP[\fBomp\fP]\fB\&.s\fP[\fBources\fP]\fB\&.u\fP[\fBnix\fP]\&', where
the last part of the completion is just as normal\&.
.PP
With the pattern shown above, the string `\fBc\&.u\fP\&' could not be
completed to `\fBcomp\&.sources\&.unix\fP\&' because the single star means
that no dot (matched by the anchor) can be skipped\&. By using two stars 
as in `\fBr:|\&.=**\fP\&', however, `\fBc\&.u\fP' could be completed to
`\fBcomp\&.sources\&.unix\fP\&'\&. This also shows that in some cases,
especially if the anchor is a real pattern, like a character class,
the form with two stars may result in more matches than one would like\&.
.PP
The second specification is needed to make this work when the cursor is
in the middle of the string on the command line and the option
\fBCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\fP is set\&. In this case the completion code would
normally try to match trial completions that end with the string as
typed so far, i\&.e\&. it will only insert new characters at the cursor
position rather than at the end\&.  However in our example we would like
the code to recognise matches which contain extra characters after the
string on the line (the `\fBnix\fP\&' in the example)\&.  Hence we say that the
empty string at the end of the string on the line matches any characters
at the end of the trial completion\&.
.PP
More generally, the specification
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'r:|[\&.,_\-]=* r:|=*' \&.\&.\&. \fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
allows one to complete words with abbreviations before any of the
characters in the square brackets\&.  For example, to
complete \fBveryverylongfile\&.c\fP rather than \fBveryverylongheader\&.h\fP
with the above in effect, you can just type \fBvery\&.c\fP before attempting
completion\&.
.PP
The specifications with both a left and a right anchor are useful to
complete partial words whose parts are not separated by some
special character\&. For example, in some places strings have to be
completed that are formed `\fBLikeThis\fP\&' (i\&.e\&. the separate parts are
determined by a leading upper case letter) or maybe one has to
complete strings with trailing numbers\&. Here one could use the simple
form with only one anchor as in:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'r:|[[:upper:]0\-9]=* r:|=*' LikeTHIS FooHoo 5foo123 5bar234\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
But with this, the string `\fBH\fP\&' would neither complete to `\fBFooHoo\fP'
nor to `\fBLikeTHIS\fP\&' because in each case there is an upper case
letter before the `\fBH\fP\&' and that is matched by the anchor\&. Likewise, 
a `\fB2\fP\&' would not be completed\&. In both cases this could be changed
by using `\fBr:|[[:upper:]0\-9]=**\fP\&', but then `\fBH\fP' completes to both
`\fBLikeTHIS\fP\&' and `\fBFooHoo\fP' and a `\fB2\fP' matches the other
strings because characters can be inserted before every upper case
letter and digit\&. To avoid this one would use:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompadd \-M \&'r:[^[:upper:]0\-9]||[[:upper:]0\-9]=** r:|=*' \e 
    LikeTHIS FooHoo foo123 bar234\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
By using these two anchors, a `\fBH\fP\&' matches only upper case `\fBH\fP's that 
are immediately preceded by something matching the left anchor
`\fB[^[:upper:]0\-9]\fP\&'\&. The effect is, of course, that `\fBH\fP' matches only
the string `\fBFooHoo\fP\&', a `\fB2\fP' matches only `\fBbar234\fP' and so on\&.
.PP
When using the completion system (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1)), users can define match specifications that are to be used for
specific contexts by using the \fBmatcher\fP and \fBmatcher\-list\fP
styles\&. The values for the latter will be used everywhere\&.

The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
Help files are installed by default to a subdirectory of \fB/usr/share/zsh\fP
or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
perl ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.8/Util/helpfiles ~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&. When unset, it uses the default installation path\&.
To use your own set of help files, set this to the appropriate path
in one of your startup files:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBHELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP

To use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:

Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP\&' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP

If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date

because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won\&'t check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.

relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIarg\fPs are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'\&.
For example:

This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn\&'t exist or

reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and

.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.8/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the `\fBsource\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\fP' commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter
in bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP\&' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP\&' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP\&'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.8/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it\&'s best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you\&'re using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see \fIzshmisc\fP(1),
in that they are automatic called at a specific point during shell execution\&.
Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be
called at the same point; these are so\-called `hook functions\&'\&.
The shell function \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP provides a simple way of adding or
removing functions from the array\&.
.RS
.PP
\fIhook\fP is one of \fBchpwd\fP, \fBperiodic\fP, \fBprecmd\fP, \fBpreexec\fP,
\fBzshaddhistory\fP, \fBzshexit\fP, or \fBzsh_directory_name\fP,
the special functions in question\&.  Note that \fBzsh_directory_name\fP
is called in a different way from the other functions, but may
still be manipulated as a hook\&.
.PP
\fIfunction\fP is name of an ordinary shell function\&.  If no options

.SH "REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The function \fBcdr\fP allows you to change the working directory to a
previous working directory from a list maintained automatically\&.  It is
similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the \fBpushd\fP,
\fBpopd\fP and \fBdirs\fP builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores
all entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
between terminal emulators in the current session\&.  (The \fBpushd\fP
directory stack is not actually modified or used by \fBcdr\fP unless you
configure it to do so as described in the configuration section below\&.)
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.PP
The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time the
directory changes\&.  To install the system, autoload the required functions
and use the \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP function described above:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add\-zsh\-hook
add\-zsh\-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which
command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered
in most\-recent\-first order\&.
.PP
.SS "Use"
.PP
All direct user interaction is via the \fBcdr\fP function\&.
.PP
The argument to cdr is a number \fIN\fP corresponding to the \fIN\fPth most
recently changed\-to directory\&.  1 is the immediately preceding directory;
the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination\&.
Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory
changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per\-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP style below\&.
.PP
If you set the \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP style described below \fBcdr\fP
will behave the same as \fBcd\fP if given a non\-numeric argument, or more
than one argument\&.  The recent directory list is updated just the same
however you change directory\&.
.PP
If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed\&.  This is similar to \fBpushd\fP\&'s
behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack\&.
.PP
Completion for the argument to \fBcdr\fP is available if compinit has been
run; menu selection is recommended, using:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection\fP
.fi
.RE

to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is preserved,
so the first choice is the most recent directory before the current one\&.
The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the directory is shown; this

.PP
.PD 0

.PP
.SS "Configuration"
.PP
Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be familiar
from completion; if not, see the description of the \fBzstyle\fP command in

.PP
An exception is \fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP, which is used exclusively by the
completion system and so has the usual completion system context
(\fB\&':completion:*'\fP if nothing more specific is needed), though again
\fB\&'*'\fP should be fine in practice\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP
If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory index, and
either there is more than one argument or the argument is not an
integer, then fall through to "cd"\&.  This allows the lazy to use only
one command for directory changing\&.  Completion recognises this, too;
see recent\-dirs\-insert for how to control completion when this option
is in use\&.
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP
The file where the list of directories is saved\&.  The default
is \fB${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.chpwd\-recent\-dirs\fP, i\&.e\&. this is in your
home directory unless you have set the variable \fBZDOTDIR\fP to point
somewhere else\&.  Directory names are saved in \fB$\&'\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB'\fP quoted
form, so each line in the file can be supplied directly to the shell as an
argument\&.
.RS
.PP
The value of this style may be an array\&.  In this case, the first
file in the list will always be used for saving directories while any
other files are left untouched\&.  When reading the recent directory
list, if there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the
first file, the contents of later files in the array will be appended
with duplicates removed from the list shown\&.  The contents of the two
files are not sorted together, i\&.e\&. all the entries in the first file
are shown first\&.  The special value \fB+\fP can appear in the list to
indicate the default file should be read at that point\&.  This allows
effects like the following:

\fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP
Used by completion\&.  If \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP is true, then setting
this to \fBtrue\fP causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to
be inserted on the command line; this has the same effect as using
the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer and the line
easier to edit\&.  With this setting, if part of an argument was
already typed, normal directory completion rather than recent
directory completion is done; this is because recent directory
completion is expected to be done by cycling through entries menu
fashion\&.
.RS

be completed; in that case, use the \fBcd\fP command when you want to

.RS
.PP
.PD 0

.PD
\fBparent\fP
Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent list\&.
If present, changing directly down by any number of directories
causes the current directory to be overwritten\&.  For example,
changing from ~pws to ~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be
left on the recent directory stack\&.  This only applies to direct
changes to descendant directories; earlier directories on the
list are not pruned\&.  For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another
to ~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned\&.
.TP
\fBpattern:\fIpattern\fP\fP
Gives a zsh pattern for directories that should not be
added to the recent list (if not already there)\&.  This element
can be repeated to add different patterns\&.  For example,

This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not

.PP
Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are
preserved across sessions\&.  Note currently no file locking is applied:
the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
(unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change
directory in one window at once\&.  This is not safe on shared accounts,
but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is
changing to a different set of directories behind your back\&.
.PP
To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls
(but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the
like) are saved\&.  Shell functions should use \fBcd \-q\fP or \fBpushd \-q\fP to
avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the
command line\&.  See the contents of the function \fBchpwd_recent_dirs\fP for

\fIuser\-context\fP

\fIrepo\-root\-name\fP

\fBbranchformat\fP
Some backends replace \fB%b\fP in the formats and

\fBnvcsformats\fP
These "formats" are exported when we didn\&'t detect a version control system

\fBhgrevformat\fP
\fBhg\fP uses both a hash and a revision number to reference a specific
changeset in a repository\&. With this style you can format the revision
string (see \fBbranchformat\fP) to include either or both\&. It\&'s only
useful when \fBget\-revision\fP is true\&. Note, the full 40\-character revision id

executing hg more than once per prompt is too slow; you may customize this

\fBuse\-server\fP
This is used by the Perforce backend (\fBp4\fP) to decide if it should

the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found\&.  If the
server (more specifically, the \fBhost\fP\fB:\fP\fBport\fP pair describing the
server) cannot be contacted, its name is put into the associative array
\fBvcs_info_p4_dead_servers\fP and is not contacted again during the session
until it is removed by hand\&.  If you do not set this style, the \fBp4\fP
backend is only usable if you have set the environment variable
\fBP4CONFIG\fP to a file name and have corresponding files in the root

mechanism can handle it\&. Similarly, to hand down \fB%b\fP from

cannot be easily avoided\&. Luckily we do not clash with a lot of prompt
expansions and this only needs to be done for those\&.
.PP
.SS "Quilt Support"
.PP
\fBQuilt\fP is not a version control system, therefore this is not implemented
as a backend\&. It can help keeping track of a series of patches\&. People use it
to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of software packages (which
is tightly integrated into the package build process \- the Debian project
does this for a large number of packages)\&. Quilt can also help individual
developers keep track of their own patches on top of real version control
systems\&.
.PP
The \fBvcs_info\fP integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by
having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon\&' mode and
`standalone\&' mode)\&.
.PP
For `addon\&' mode to become active \fBvcs_info\fP must have already detected a
real version control system controlling the directory\&. If that is the case,
a directory that holds quilt\&'s patches needs to be found\&. That directory is
configurable via the `\fBQUILT_PATCHES\fP\&' environment variable\&. If that
variable exists its value is used, otherwise the value `\fBpatches\fP\&' is
assumed\&. The value from \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP can be overwritten using the
\fB`quilt\-patches\&'\fP style\&. (Note: you can use \fBvcs_info\fP to keep the value
of \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP correct all the time via the \fBpost\-quilt\fP hook)\&.
.PP
When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active\&. To
gather more information, \fBvcs_info\fP looks for a directory called `\&.pc\&';
Quilt uses that directory to track its current state\&. If this directory does
not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the working directory
(read: no patches have been applied yet)\&.
.PP
If patches are applied, \fBvcs_info\fP will try to find out which\&. If you want
to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to activate
the \fBget\-unapplied\fP style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
\fBvcs_info\fP allows for very detailed control over how the gathered
information is presented (see the below sections, \fBStyles\fP and \fBHooks in
vcs_info\fP), all of which are documented below\&. Note there are a number of
other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version control
system (like \fBstgit\fP for \fBgit\fP, or \fBmq\fP for \fBhg\fP); the configuration
for systems like that are generally configured the same way as the \fBquilt\fP
support\&.
.PP
If the \fBquilt\fP support is working in `addon\&' mode, the produced string is
available as a simple format replacement (\fB%Q\fP to be precise), which can
be used in \fBformats\fP and \fBactionformats\fP; see below for details)\&.
.PP
If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone\&' mode,
\fBvcs_info\fP will pretend as if \fBquilt\fP were an actual version control
system\&. That means that the version control system identifier (which
otherwise would be something like `svn\&' or `cvs') will be set to
`\fB\-quilt\-\fP\&'\&. This has implications on the used style context where this
identifier is the second element\&. \fBvcs_info\fP will have filled in a proper
value for the "repository\&'s" root directory and the string containing the
information about quilt\&'s state will be available as the `misc' replacement
(and \fB%Q\fP for compatibility with `addon\&' mode\&.
.PP
What is left to discuss is how `standalone\&' mode is detected\&. The detection
itself is a series of searches for directories\&. You can have this detection
enabled all the time in every directory that is not otherwise under version
control\&. If you know there is only a limited set of trees where you would
like \fBvcs_info\fP to try and look for Quilt in `standalone\&' mode to minimise
the amount of searching on every call to \fBvcs_info\fP, there are a number of
ways to do that:
.PP
Essentially, `standalone\&' mode detection is controlled by a style called
`\fBquilt\-standalone\fP\&'\&. It is a string style and its value can have different
effects\&. The simplest values are: `\fBalways\fP\&' to run detection every time
\fBvcs_info\fP is run, and `\fBnever\fP\&' to turn the detection off entirely\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is something else, it is interpreted
differently\&. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of that
variable is checked and that value is used in the same `always\&'/`never' way
as described above\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an array, the elements of that array
are used as directory names under which you want the detection to be active\&.
.PP
If \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an associative array, the keys are taken as
directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but only if
the corresponding value is the string `\fBtrue\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Last, but not least, if the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is the name of a
function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
decides whether detection should be active\&. A `0\&' return value is true; a
non\-zero return value is interpreted as false\&.
.PP
Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of
\fBquilt\-standalone\fP, the function will take precedence\&.

.SS "Hooks in vcs_info"
.PP
Hooks are places in \fBvcs_info\fP where you can run your own code\&. That
code can communicate with the code that called it and through that,
change the system\&'s behaviour\&.
.PP
For configuration, hooks change the style context:
.RS
.nf
\fB:vcs_info:\fIvcs\-string\fP+\fIhook\-name\fP:\fIuser\-context\fP:\fIrepo\-root\-name\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the \fBhooks\fP
style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
Example:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This registers functions to the hook `foo\&' for all backends\&. In order to
avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by
a `\fB+vi\-\fP\&', so the actual functions called for the `foo' hook are
`\fB+vi\-bar\fP\&' and `\fB+vi\-baz\fP'\&.
.PP
If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the
current context, you may use the \fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP function\&. To remove
a function that was added like that, the \fBvcs_info_hookdel\fP function
can be used\&.
.PP
If something seems weird, you can enable the `debug\&' boolean style in
the proper context and the hook\-calling code will print what it tried
to execute and whether the function in question existed\&.
.PP
When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
executed one after another until one function returns non\-zero or until
all functions have been called\&. Context\-sensitive hook functions are
executed \fBbefore\fP statically registered ones (the ones added by
\fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP)\&.
.PP
You may pass data between functions via an associative array, \fBuser_data\fP\&.
For example:
.RS
.nf
\fB
+vi\-git\-myfirsthook(){
    user_data[myval]=$myval
}
+vi\-git\-mysecondhook(){
    # do something with ${user_data[myval]}

.TP
.PD
\fBret\fP
The return value that the hooks system will return to the caller\&. The
default is an integer `zero\&'\&. If and how a changed \fBret\fP value changes
the execution of the caller depends on the specific hook\&. See the hook
documentation below for details\&.
.TP
\fBhook_com\fP
An associated array which is used for bidirectional communication from
the caller to hook functions\&. The used keys depend on the specific hook\&.
.TP
\fBcontext\fP
The active context of the hook\&. Functions that wish to change this
variable should make it local scope first\&.
.TP
\fBvcs\fP
The current VCS after it was detected\&. The same values as in the
enable/disable style are used\&. Available in all hooks except \fBstart\-up\fP\&.

Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBstart\-up\fP
Called after starting \fBvcs_info\fP but before the VCS in this directory is

necessary\&. When \fBret\fP is set to \fB1\fP, \fBvcs_info\fP aborts and does
nothing; when set to \fB2\fP, \fBvcs_info\fP sets up everything as if no
version control were active and exits\&.
.TP
\fBpre\-get\-data\fP
Same as \fBstart\-up\fP but after the VCS was detected\&.
.TP
\fBgen\-hg\-bookmark\-string\fP
Called in the Mercurial backend when a bookmark string is generated; the

\fBgen\-applied\-string\fP
Called in the \fBgit\fP (with \fBstgit\fP or during rebase), and \fBhg\fP

\fBset\-message\fP
Called each time before a `\fBvcs_info_msg_\fP\fIN\fP\fB_\fP\&' message is set\&.

variable name, the second is the currently configured \fBformats\fP or
\fBactionformats\fP\&.

There are a number of `\fBhook_com\fP\&' keys, that are used here:
`\fBaction\fP\&', `\fBbranch\fP', `\fBbase\fP', `\fBbase\-name\fP', `\fBsubdir\fP',
`\fBstaged\fP\&', `\fBunstaged\fP', `\fBrevision\fP', `\fBmisc\fP', `\fBvcs\fP'
and one `\fBmiscN\fP\&' entry for each backend\-specific data field (\fBN\fP
starting at zero)\&. They are set to the values figured out so far by
\fBvcs_info\fP and any change will be used directly when the actual
replacement is done\&.
.PP
Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each configured
\fBformats\fP or \fBactionformats\fP), each of the `\fBhook_com\fP\&' keys mentioned
above (except for the \fBmiscN\fP entries) has an `\fB_orig\fP\&' counterpart,
so even if you changed a value to your liking you can still get the
original value in the next run\&. Changing the `\fB_orig\fP\&' values is
probably not a good idea\&.

First, we will tell \fBvcs_info\fP to call a function when populating
the message variables with the gathered information:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+set\-message:*' hooks svn2subversion\fP

Nothing happens\&. Which is reasonable, since we didn\&'t define the actual

`\fBdebug\fP\&' style:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug true\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
That should give you an idea what is going on\&. Specifically, the function
that we are looking for is `\fB+vi\-svn2subversion\fP\&'\&. Note, the `\fB+vi\-\fP'

checking out the debugging output, disable it again:
.RS

Now, let\&'s define the function:

.fi
.RE

Simple enough\&. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had
registered our function in a less generic context\&. If we do it only in
the `\fBsvn\fP\&' backend's context, we don't need to test which the active
backend is:

a customised bookmark string for the \fBhg\fP backend\&.

Again, we start off by registering a function:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:hg+gen\-hg\-bookmark\-string:*' hooks hgbookmarks\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
And then we define the `\fB+vi\-hgbookmarks\fP function:
.RS
.nf
\fB
function +vi\-hgbookmarks() {
    # The default is to connect all bookmark names by
    # commas\&. This mixes things up a little\&.
    # Imagine, there\&'s one type of bookmarks that is
    # special to you\&. Say, because it\&'s *your* work\&.
    # Those bookmarks look always like this: "sh/*"
    # (because your initials are sh, for example)\&.
    # This makes the bookmarks string use only those
    # bookmarks\&. If there\&'s more than one, it
    # concatenates them using commas\&.
    # The bookmarks returned by `hg\&' are available in
    # the function\&'s positional parameters\&.
    local s="${(Mj:,:)@:#sh/*}"
    # Now, the communication with the code that calls
    # the hook functions is done via the hook_com[]

The eight `\fB\-match\fP\&' functions are drop\-in replacements for the

way\&.  However, by the use of styles and the function \fBselect\-word\-style\fP,
the way words are matched can be altered\&.
.RS

The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user\-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used\&.  The first
time it is invoked, the eight \fB\-match\fP functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly\&.

All but `\fBdefault\fP\&' can be input as an upper case character, which has
the same effect but with subword matching turned on\&.  In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number of
other characters, is considered a word\&.  The style \fBsubword\-range\fP
can supply an alternative character range to the default `\fB[:upper:]\fP\&';
the value of the style is treated as the contents of a `\fB[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'
pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only
those surrounding named ranges)\&.
.PP
More control can be obtained using the \fBzstyle\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Each style is looked up in the
context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP where \fIwidget\fP is the name of the
user\-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the
appropriate contexts are \fB:zle:forward\-word\fP, and so on\&.  The function
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP itself always defines styles for the context
`\fB:zle:*\fP\&' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as

overridden by the styles \fBword\-chars\fP or \fBword\-class\fP\&.
.TP
\fBspecified\fP
Similar to \fBnormal\fP, but \fIonly\fP the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters\&.
.TP
\fBunspecified\fP
The negation of specified\&.  The given characters are those which will
\fInot\fP be considered part of a word\&.
.TP
\fBshell\fP
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments\&.  In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as `\fB()\fP\&' are also treated as words\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are whitespace\-delimited strings of characters\&.
.PP
The first three of those rules usually use \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style \fBword\-chars\fP, which works
in exactly the same way as \fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.  In addition, the style
\fBword\-class\fP uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over \fBword\-chars\fP if both are set\&.  The \fBword\-class\fP style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `\fB\-:[:alnum:]\fP\&' is a valid \fBword\-class\fP to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `\fB\-\fP\&' and `\fB:\fP'\&.  Be careful
including `\fB]\fP\&', `\fB^\fP' and `\fB\-\fP' as these are special inside
character classes\&.
.PP
\fBword\-style\fP may also have `\fB\-subword\fP\&' appended to its value to
turn on subword matching, as described above\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-chars\fP is mostly useful for
\fBtranspose\-words\fP and similar functions\&.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are\&.  For example, if
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':zle:transpose\-words' skip\-chars 1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
has been set, and \fBtranspose\-words\-match\fP is called with the cursor on
the \fIX\fP of \fBfoo\fP\fIX\fP\fBbar\fP, where \fIX\fP can be any character, then
the resulting expression is \fBbar\fP\fIX\fP\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style \fBword\-context\fP
to an array of pairs of entries\&.  Each pair of entries consists of a
\fIpattern\fP and a \fIsubcontext\fP\&.  The shell argument the cursor is on is
matched against each \fIpattern\fP in turn until one matches; if it does,
the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding \fIsubcontext\fP\&.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with no
stripping of quotes\&.  Special handling is done between words: the current
context is examined and if it contains the string \fBback\fP, the word before
the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is considered\&. Some
examples are given below\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-whitespace\-first\fP is only used with the
\fBforward\-word\fP widget\&.  If it is set to true, then \fBforward\-word\fP
skips any non\-word\-characters, followed by any non\-word\-characters:
this is similar to the behaviour of other word\-orientated widgets,
and also that used by other editors, however it differs from the
standard zsh behaviour\&.  When using \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the widget
is set in the context \fB:zle:*\fP to \fBtrue\fP if the word style is
\fBbash\fP and \fBfalse\fP otherwise\&.  It may be overridden by setting it in
the more specific context \fB:zle:forward\-word*\fP\&.
.PP
Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the
simplified interface in \fBselect\-word\-style\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf

.RE
.PP
This provides two different ways of using \fBtranspose\-words\fP depending on
whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here
any word containing a \fB/\fP\&.  On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed\&.  In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed\&.  Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for \fB:zle:transpose\-words\fP\&.
.PP
The word matching and all the handling of \fBzstyle\fP settings is actually
implemented by the function \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP\&.  This can be used to
create new user\-defined widgets\&.  The calling function should set the local
parameter \fBcurcontext\fP to \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP, create the local
parameter \fBmatched_words\fP and call \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP with no
arguments\&.  On return, \fBmatched_words\fP will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non\-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non\-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non\-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
\fBskip\-chars\fP style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non\-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line\&.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test
for this to decide whether it can perform its function\&.

\fBcopy\-earlier\-word\fP
This widget works like a combination of \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP and
\fBcopy\-prev\-shell\-word\fP\&.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
earlier words on the relevant history line\&.  With a numeric argument
\fIN\fP, insert the \fIN\fPth word from the history line; \fIN\fP may be
negative to count from the end of the line\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP has been used to retrieve the last word on a
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with
earlier words from the same line\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being edited\&.

be called to retrieve words\&.  This widget must accept the same three
arguments as \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP\&.

\fBcycle\-completion\-positions\fP
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new
function based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at least one
of the possible matches\&.  It will then place the cursor on the
position it considers to be the most interesting one, i\&.e\&. the one
where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as 
little typing as possible\&.

This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other interesting

reported by the completion system\&.
.RE

\fBdelete\-whole\-word\-match\fP
This is another function which works like the \fB\-match\fP functions
described immediately above, i\&.e\&. using styles to decide the word
boundaries\&.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing function\&.
.RS
.PP
The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor\&.  There is no
numeric argument handling; only the single word around the cursor is
considered\&.  If the widget contains the string \fBkill\fP, the removed text
will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking\&.  This can be obtained
by defining \fBkill\-whole\-word\-match\fP as follows:
.PP

the start of the current line\&.  In this case, however, they search for
a line which matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in

position is remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a
second time, so that the same search is repeated to look farther through
the history\&.

\fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-menu\fP
This function implements yet another form of history searching\&.  The
text before the cursor is used to select lines from the history,
as for \fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-backward\fP except that all matches are
shown in a numbered menu\&.  Typing the appropriate digits inserts the
full history line\&.  Note that leading zeroes must be typed (they are only
shown when necessary for removing ambiguity)\&.  The entire history is
searched; there is no distinction between forwards and backwards\&.
.RS
.PP
With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start of
the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the line
in the history\&.
.PP
If the widget name contains `\fB\-end\fP\&' the cursor is moved to the end of
the line inserted\&.  If the widget name contains `\fB\-space\fP\&' any space
in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match anything (hence
a leading space is equivalent to giving a numeric argument)\&.  Both
forms can be combined, for example:

.RE
.RE

\fBhistory\-pattern\-search\fP
The function \fBhistory\-pattern\-search\fP implements widgets which prompt
for a pattern with which to search the history backwards or forwards\&.  The
pattern is in the usual zsh format, however the first character may be
\fB^\fP to anchor the search to the start of the line, and the last character
may be \fB$\fP to anchor the search to the end of the line\&.  If the
search was not anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned
just after the pattern found\&.

\fBinsert\-composed\-char\fP
This function allows you to compose characters that don\&'t appear on the
keyboard to be inserted into the command line\&.  The command is followed by
two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt)\&.  For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a code
for the accent, while for other special characters the two characters
together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted\&.  The
two\-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for
example \fBhttp://www\&.faqs\&.org/rfcs/rfc1345\&.html\fP)\&.
.RS
.PP
The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read\&.  For example,
\fBinsert\-composed\-char a:\fP can be used within a widget to insert an a with
umlaut into the command line\&.  This has the advantages over use of a
literal character that it is more portable\&.
.PP
For best results zsh should have been built with support for multibyte
characters (configured with \fB\-\-enable\-multibyte\fP); however, the function
works for the limited range of characters available in single\-byte
character sets such as ISO\-8859\-1\&.
.PP
The character is converted into the local representation and
inserted into the command line at the cursor position\&.
(The conversion is done within the shell, using whatever facilities
the C library provides\&.)  With a numeric argument, the character and its
code are previewed in the status line
.PP
The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the character
(together with a newline) to standard output\&.  Input is still read from
keystrokes\&.

See \fBinsert\-unicode\-char\fP for an alternative way of inserting Unicode
characters using their hexadecimal character number\&.

the calling widget should call this function with the option \fB\-S\fP,
perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user
via `\fBzle recursive\-edit\fP\&', then call this function with the option
\fB\-R\fP\&.  The argument \fIstatepm\fP must be a suitable name for an ordinary

\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP is a simple widget which calls

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don\&'t even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn\&'t match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting\&'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

\fBread\-from\-minibuffer\fP
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right\&.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, \fBexecute\-named\-cmd\fP)\&.  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP), the function returns status 1
and \fB$REPLY\fP is not set\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fB? \fP\&' is used\&.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of \fB$LBUFFER\fP, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of \fB$RBUFFER\fP\&.  This provides a default
value and starting cursor placement\&.  Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of \fB$REPLY\fP\&.
.PP
One option is available: `\fB\-k\fP \fInum\fP\&' specifies that \fInum\fP
characters are to be read instead of a whole line\&.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings
the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
\fB$REPLY\fP, not the entire buffer\&.  Note that unlike the \fBread\fP builtin
\fInum\fP must be given; there is no default\&.

\fBreplace\-string\-again\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\-again\fP
The function \fBreplace\-string\fP implements three widgets\&.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer\&.
.RS
.PP
If the widget name contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&', for example by
defining the widget using the command `\fBzle \-N replace\-pattern
replace\-string\fP\&', then the matching is performed using zsh patterns\&.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect\&.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions\&.
Furthermore, a `\fB&\fP\&' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `\fB\e\fP\fIN\fP\&' will be
replaced by the \fIN\fPth parenthesised expression matched\&.  The form
`\fB\e{\fP\fIN\fP\fB}\fP\&' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits\&.
.PP
If the widget instead contains the word `\fBregex\fP\&' (or `\fBregexp\fP'),
then the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting
the setting of the option \fBRE_MATCH_PCRE\fP (see the description of the
function \fBregexp\-replace\fP below)\&.  The special replacement facilities
described above for pattern matching are available\&.
.PP
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing\&.  However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
\fBedit\-previous\fP in the context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP (for example,
\fB:zle:replace\-string\fP) to \fBtrue\fP\&.  In addition, a positive
numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or
zero argument forces them not to be\&.
.PP
The function \fBreplace\-string\-again\fP can be used to repeat the previous
replacement; no prompting is done\&.  As with \fBreplace\-string\fP, if the name
of the widget contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&' or `\fBregex\fP', pattern or
regular expression matching is performed, else a literal string
replacement\&.  Note that the previous source and replacement text are the
same whether pattern, regular expression or string matching is used\&.
.PP
In addition, \fBreplace\-string\fP shows the previous replacement above
the prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if the
source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated without
the widget prompting for a replacement string\&.
.PP
For example, starting from the line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains fan and fond\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and invoking \fBreplace\-pattern\fP with the source string
`\fBf(?)n\fP\&' and
the replacement string `\fBc\e1r\fP\&' produces the not very useful line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains car and cord\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP widget\&.  One limitation of the current
version is that \fBundo\fP will cycle through changes to the replacement
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBsend\-invisible\fP
This is similar to read\-from\-minibuffer in that it may be called as a
function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and interactively reads
input from the keyboard\&.  However, the input being typed is concealed and
a string of asterisks (`\fB*\fP\&') is shown instead\&.  The value is saved in
the parameter \fB$INVISIBLE\fP to which a reference is inserted into the
editing buffer at the restored cursor position\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP) or another escape from editing such
as \fBpush\-line\fP, \fB$INVISIBLE\fP is set to empty and the original buffer
is restored unchanged\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fBNon\-echoed text: \fP\&' is used (as in emacs)\&.  If a second and
third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the reference
to \fB$INVISIBLE\fP that is inserted into the buffer\&.  The default is to
open with \fB${\fP, then \fBINVISIBLE\fP, and close with \fB}\fP, but many
other effects are possible\&.

words in comments are ignored when \fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP is set\&.

Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting\&'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted\&.  The default definition of ``interesting\&'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash\&.
This definition may be overridden by use of the \fBmatch\fP style\&.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is \fB:insert\-last\-word\fP\&.  However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:

Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor

the line above the cursor down by a number of lines\&.
.PP
With a negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the
cursor\&.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the
start of the previous line\&.  Using a numeric argument less than \-1

number of lines\&.

\fBzcalc\-auto\-insert\fP
This function is useful together with the \fBzcalc\fP function described in

It should be bound to a key representing a binary operator such

if the key occurs at the start of the line or immediately following
an open parenthesis, the text \fB"ans "\fP is inserted before the
representation of the key itself\&.  This allows easy use of the
answer from the previous calculation in the current line\&.  The
text to be inserted before the symbol typed can be modified by setting
the variable \fBZCALC_AUTO_INSERT_PREFIX\fP\&.

before the first argument, and finishing with any whitespace after the last
argument\&.  Hence (so long as the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not set)
whitespace is given by odd indices in the array and arguments by
even indices\&.  Note that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together
all the elements of \fBreply\fP in order is guaranteed to produce the
original line\&.

The parameter \fBREPLY\fP is set to the index of the word in \fBreply\fP which

Alternatively, if the argument does not contain the string \fBARG\fP, it

In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may be
thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try\&' block\&.  However, note that it
must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell forked for a
pipeline, parenthesised current\-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution\&.
.PP
The system internally uses the shell variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching\&.  One drawback of this
scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP
remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an exception
if a shell error subsequently occurs\&.  Adding \fBunset EXCEPTION\fP at the
start of the outermost layer of any code that uses exception handling will
eliminate this problem\&.

.SH "MIME FUNCTIONS"

Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file \fBtext\&.ps\fP when executed as a
command to an appropriate viewer\&.

\fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP [ \fB\-l\fP ] \fIcommand argument\fP \&.\&.\&.
These two functions use the files \fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fB/etc/mime\&.types\fP,
which associate types and extensions, as well as \fB~/\&.mailcap\fP and
\fB/etc/mailcap\fP files, which associate types and the programs that
handle them\&.  These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia
Internet Mail Extensions\&.
.RS
.PP
To enable the system, the function \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP should be
autoloaded and run\&.  This allows files with extensions to be treated
as executable; such files be completed by the function completion system\&.
The function \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP should not need to be called by the
user\&.
.PP
The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `\fBalias \-s\fP\&'\&.
Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten\&.
.PP
For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also
automatically be handled (e\&.g\&. \fBPDF\fP is automatically handled if
handling for the suffix \fBpdf\fP is defined), but not vice versa\&.
.PP
Repeated calls to \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP do not override the existing
mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option \fB\-f\fP
is given\&.  Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix
aliases assigned to handlers other than \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option \fB\-l\fP lists the existing
mappings without altering them\&.  Suffixes to list (which may contain
pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation
on the command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise
all suffixes are listed\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option
\fB\-v\fP causes verbose output to be shown during the setup operation\&.
.PP
The system respects the \fBmailcap\fP flags \fBneedsterminal\fP and
\fBcopiousoutput\fP, see \fImailcap\fP(4)\&.
.PP
The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
\fBzstyle\fP builtin command (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.  They should be defined
before \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP is run\&.  The contexts used all
start with \fB:mime:\fP, with additional components in some cases\&.
It is recommended that a trailing \fB*\fP (suitably quoted) be appended
to style patterns in case the system is extended in future\&.  Some
examples are given below\&.
.PP
For files that have multiple suffixes, e\&.g\&. \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP, where the
context includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the
longest possible suffix until a match for the style is found\&.
For example, if \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP produces a match for the handler, that
will be used; otherwise the handler for \fB\&.gz\fP will be used\&.  Note
that, owing to the way suffix aliases work, it is always required that
there be a handler for the shortest possible suffix, so in this example
\fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP can only be handled if \fB\&.gz\fP is also handled (though
not necessarily in the same way)\&.  Alternatively, if no handling
for \fB\&.gz\fP on its own is needed, simply adding the command
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias \-s gz=zsh\-mime\-handler\fP

\fBcurrent\-shell\fP
If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in
question is run using the \fBeval\fP builtin instead of by starting a new
\fBsh\fP process\&.  This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional
cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax\&.
.TP
\fBdisown\fP
If this boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started in the
background will be disowned, i\&.e\&. not subject to job control within
the parent shell\&.  Such handlers nearly always produce their own
windows, so the only likely harmful side effect of setting the style is
that it becomes harder to kill jobs from within the shell\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-as\-is\fP
This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files
passed for execution with a handler program\&.  If the file matches
the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its current form,
with no handler\&.  This is useful for files which might have suffixes
but nonetheless be executable in their own right\&.  If the style
is not set, the pattern \fB*(*) *(/)\fP is used;
hence executable files are executed directly and not passed to a
handler, and the option \fBAUTO_CD\fP may be used to change to directories
that happen to have MIME suffixes\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-never\fP
This style is useful in combination with \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.  It is
set to an array of patterns corresponding to full paths to files that
should never be treated as executable, even if the file passed to
the MIME handler matches \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.  This is useful for file
systems that don\&'t handle execute permission or that contain executables
from another operating system\&.  For example, if \fB/mnt/windows\fP is a
Windows mount, then
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':mime:*' execute\-never '/mnt/windows/*'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will ensure that any files found in that area will be executed as MIME
types even if they are executable\&.  As this example shows, the complete
file name is matched against the pattern, regardless of how the file
was passed to the handler\&.  The file is resolved to a full path using
the \fB:A\fP modifier described in
the subsection Modifiers in \fIzshexpn\fP(1);
this means that symbolic links are resolved where possible, so that
links into other file systems behave in the correct fashion\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfile\-path\fP
Used if the style \fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP is true for the same context\&.
Set to an array of directories that are used for searching for the
file to be handled; the default is the command path given by the
special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.  The shell option \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is respected;
if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the
name of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line contains
a `\fB/\fP\&'\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP
If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths
to be searched for in the command path or the path specified by the
\fBfile\-path\fP style\&.  If the file is not found in the path, it is looked
for locally (whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is
not found locally, the handler will abort unless the \fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
style is set\&.  Files found in the path are tested as described for

\fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
By default, arguments that don\&'t correspond to files are not passed
to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found
in the path that happen to have suffixes\&.  This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the
handler even if they don\&'t exist\&.  If it is not explicitly set it
defaults to \fB[[:alpha:]]#:/*\fP which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME

to distinguish this use of the context\&.  This overrides any handler
specified by the \fBmailcap\fP files\&.  If the handler requires a terminal,
the \fBflags\fP style should be set to include the word \fBneedsterminal\fP,

If the extension is handled by \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP but the file is

Non\-programmers should note that, as in many other programming
languages, expressions involving only integers (whether constants
without a `\fB\&.\fP\&', variables containing such constants as strings, or

The mathematical library \fBzsh/mathfunc\fP will be loaded if it is

Each line typed is evaluated as an expression\&.  The prompt shows a number,
which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of that
calculation is stored\&.  For example, the result of the calculation on the

calculated is available as \fBans\fP\&.  Full command line editing, including
the history of previous calculations, is available; the history is saved in

A line ending with a single backslash is treated in the same fashion
as it is in command line editing:  the backslash is removed, the
function prompts for more input (the prompt is preceded by `\fB\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'
to indicate this), and the lines are combined into one to get the final
result\&.  In addition, if the input so far contains more open than
close parentheses \fBzcalc\fP will prompt for more input\&.

When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new

the script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group

If the function edits an existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP, it is up to the user
to ensure that the changes made will take effect\&.  For example, if
control usually returns early from the existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP the lines
will not be executed; or a later initialization file may override

\fBcolors\fP
This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names to

This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs\&.  Instead of
reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from
the command line\&.  This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive
glob operators, often can construct a command line for a shell function
that is longer than can be accepted by an external command\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIoption\fP list represents options of the \fBzargs\fP command itself,
which are the same as those of \fBxargs\fP\&.  The \fIinput\fP list is the
collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the
\fBcommand\fP, analogous to the standard input of \fBxargs\fP\&.  Finally, the
\fIarg\fP list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are
passed to the \fIcommand\fP each time it runs\&.  The \fIarg\fP list precedes
the elements from the \fBinput\fP list in each run\&.  If no \fIcommand\fP is
provided, then no \fIarg\fP list may be provided, and in that event the
default command is `\fBprint\fP\&' with arguments `\fB\-r \-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
.PP
For example, to get a long \fBls\fP listing of all plain files in the
current directory or its subdirectories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-U zargs
zargs \-\- **/*(\&.) \-\- ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is used both to mark the end of the \fIoption\fP
list and to mark the end of the \fIinput\fP list, so it must appear twice
whenever the \fIinput\fP list may be empty\&.  If there is guaranteed to be
at least one \fIinput\fP and the first \fIinput\fP does not begin with a
`\fB\-\fP\&', then the first `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' may be omitted\&.
.PP
In the event that the string `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is or may be an \fIinput\fP, the
\fB\-e\fP option may be used to change the end\-of\-inputs marker\&.  Note that
this does \fInot\fP change the end\-of\-options marker\&.  For example, to use
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' as the marker:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzargs \-e\&.\&. \-\- **/*(\&.) \&.\&. ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&', but the best end\-marker depends on the circumstances\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-I\fP, \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, and \fB\-n\fP differ slightly
from their usage in \fBxargs\fP\&.  There are no input lines for \fBzargs\fP to
count, so \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP count through the \fIinput\fP list, and \fB\-n\fP
counts the number of arguments passed to each execution of \fIcommand\fP,
\fIincluding\fP any \fIarg\fP list\&.  Also, any time \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-I\fP is used,
each \fIinput\fP is processed separately as if by `\fB\-L\fP \fB1\fP\&'\&.

This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function\&.
.RS
.PP
Only one \fIname\fP argument is allowed\&.
If the \fB\-f\fP option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, \fBzed\fP searches
for it in the \fBfpath\fP and loads it\&.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but \fInot\fP written back to the
autoload file\&.
.PP
Without \fB\-f\fP, \fIname\fP is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary\&.
.PP
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to \fBzed\fP and the
vi command keymap to \fBzed\-vicmd\fP\&.  These will be copied from the existing
\fBmain\fP and \fBvicmd\fP keymaps if they do not exist the first time \fBzed\fP
is run\&.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed\&.
.PP
If it creates the keymap, \fBzed\fP rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and `\fB^X^W\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\fP keymap, and binds
`\fBZZ\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymap\&.
.PP
The bindings alone can be installed by running `\fBzed \-b\fP\&'\&.  This is
suitable for putting into a startup file\&.  Note that, if rerun,
this will overwrite the existing \fBzed\fP and \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps\&.
.PP
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`\fB:completion:zed\fP\&'\&.
.PP
A zle widget \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is available\&.  This can be called by
name from within zed using `\fB\eex zed\-set\-file\-name\fP\&' (note, however, that
because of zed\&'s rebindings you will have to type \fB^j\fP at the end instead
of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either of the \fBzed\fP or
\fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps after `\fBzed \-b\fP\&' has been run\&.  When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited\&.  When zed
exits the file will be written under that name and the original file will
be left alone\&.  The widget has no effect with `\fBzed \-f\fP\&'\&.
.PP
While \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is running, zed uses the keymap
\fBzed\-normal\-keymap\fP, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
at the time zed initialised its bindings\&.  (This is to make the return key
operate normally\&.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed,
the widget won\&'t notice\&.  This is not a concern for most users\&.

\fIFilename Expansion\fP
If the \fBSH_FILE_EXPANSION\fP option is set, the order of expansion is
modified for compatibility with \fBsh\fP and \fBksh\fP\&.  In that case
\fIfilename expansion\fP is performed immediately after \fIalias expansion\fP,
preceding the set of five expansions mentioned above\&.
.TP
\fIFilename Generation\fP
This expansion, commonly referred to as \fBglobbing\fP, is always done last\&.
.PP
The following sections explain the types of expansion in detail\&.
.PP
.SH "HISTORY EXPANSION"
History expansion allows you to use words from previous command
lines in the command line you are typing\&.  This simplifies spelling
corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments\&.
.PP
Immediately before execution, each command is saved in the history list,
the size of which is controlled by the \fBHISTSIZE\fP parameter\&.  The one
most recent command is always retained in any case\&.  Each saved command in
the history list is called a history \fIevent\fP and is assigned a number,
beginning with 1 (one) when the shell starts up\&.  The history number that
you may see in your prompt (see
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the \fInext\fP command\&.
.PP
.SS "Overview"
A history expansion begins with the first character of the \fBhistchars\fP
parameter, which is `\fB!\fP\&' by default, and may occur anywhere on the
command line; history expansions do not nest\&.  The `\fB!\fP\&' can be escaped
with `\fB\e\fP\&' or can be enclosed between a pair of single quotes (\fB''\fP)
to suppress its special meaning\&.  Double quotes will \fInot\fP work for
this\&.  Following this history character is an optional event designator
(see the section `Event Designators\&') and then an optional word
designator (the section `Word Designators\&'); if neither of these designators is
present, no history expansion occurs\&.
.PP
Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being expanded,
but before any other expansions take place and before the command is
executed\&.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the history event
for later references\&.
.PP
By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if it
is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous
command\&.
However, if the option \fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP is set, then every history
reference with no event specification \fIalways\fP refers to the previous
command\&.
.PP
For example, `\fB!\fP\&' is the event designator for the previous command, so
`\fB!!:1\fP\&' always refers to the first word of the previous command, and
`\fB!!$\fP\&' always refers to the last word of the previous command\&.  With
\fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP set, then `\fB!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!$\fP' function in the
same manner as `\fB!!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!!$\fP', respectively\&.  Conversely, if
\fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP is unset, then `\fB!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!$\fP' refer to the
first and last words, respectively, of the same event referenced by the
nearest other history reference preceding them on the current command
line, or to the previous command if there is no preceding reference\&.
.PP
The character sequence `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\&' (where `\fB^\fP' is
actually the second character of the \fBhistchars\fP parameter)
repeats the last command, replacing the string \fIfoo\fP with \fIbar\fP\&.
More precisely, the sequence `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^\fP\&' is
synonymous with `\fB!!:s\fP\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^\fP\&', hence other
modifiers (see the section `Modifiers\&') may follow the final `\fB^\fP'\&.
In particular, `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^:G\fP\&' performs a global
substitution\&.
.PP
If the shell encounters the character sequence `\fB!"\fP\&'
in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until
the current list (see
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)) is fully parsed\&.  The `\fB!"\fP\&' is removed from the input, and any
subsequent `\fB!\fP\&' characters have no special significance\&.
.PP
A less convenient but more comprehensible form of command history support
is provided by the \fBfc\fP builtin\&.
.SS "Event Designators"
An event designator is a reference to a command\-line entry in the history
list\&.  In the list below, remember that the initial \fB`!\&'\fP in each item
may be changed to another character by setting the \fBhistchars\fP
parameter\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB!\fP
Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, newline,
`\fB=\fP\&' or `\fB(\fP'\&.  If followed immediately by a word designator
(see the section `Word Designators\&'), this forms a history reference
with no event designator (see the section `Overview\&')\&.
.TP
\fB!!\fP
Refer to the previous command\&.
By itself, this expansion
repeats the previous command\&.
.TP
\fB!\fP\fIn\fP
Refer to command\-line \fIn\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!\-\fP\fIn\fP
Refer to the current command\-line minus \fIn\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!\fP\fIstr\fP
Refer to the most recent command starting with \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!?\fP\fIstr\fP[\fB?\fP]
Refer to the most recent command containing \fIstr\fP\&.  The trailing
`\fB?\fP\&' is necessary if this reference is to be followed by a modifier or
followed by any text that is not to be considered part of \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!#\fP
Refer to the current command line typed in so far\&.  The line is
treated as if it were complete up to and including the word before the
one with the `\fB!#\fP\&' reference\&.
.TP
\fB!{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP
Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary)\&.
.SS "Word Designators"
A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command line are
to be included in a history reference\&.  A `\fB:\fP\&' usually
separates the event specification from the word designator\&.
It may be omitted only if the word designator begins with a
`\fB^\fP\&', `\fB$\fP', `\fB*\fP', `\fB\-\fP' or `\fB%\fP'\&.
Word designators include:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fB0\fP
The first input word (command)\&.
.TP
\fIn\fP
The \fIn\fPth argument\&.
.TP
\fB^\fP
The first argument\&.  That is, \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
\fB$\fP
The last argument\&.
.TP
\fB%\fP
The word matched by (the most recent) \fB?\fP\fIstr\fP search\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB\-\fP\fIy\fP
A range of words; \fIx\fP defaults to \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
\fB*\fP
All the arguments, or a null value if there are none\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB*\fP
Abbreviates `\fIx\fP\fB\-$\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB\-\fP
Like `\fIx\fP\fB*\fP\&' but omitting word \fB$\fP\&.
.PD
.PP
Note that a `\fB%\fP\&' word designator works only when used in one of
`\fB!%\fP\&', `\fB!:%\fP' or `\fB!?\fP\fIstr\fP\fB?:%\fP', and only when used after a
\fB!?\fP expansion (possibly in an earlier command)\&.  Anything else results
in an error, although the error may not be the most obvious one\&.
.SS "Modifiers"
After the optional word designator, you can add
a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers,
each preceded by a `\fB:\fP\&'\&.  These modifiers also work on the result
of \fIfilename generation\fP and \fIparameter expansion\fP, except where
noted\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBa\fP
Turn a file name into an absolute path:  prepends the current directory,
if necessary, and resolves any use of `\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' and `\fB\&.\fP' in the path\&.
Note that the transformation takes place even if the file or any
intervening directories do not exist\&.
.TP
\fBA\fP
As `\fBa\fP\&', but also resolve use of symbolic links where possible\&.
Note that resolution of `\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' occurs \fIbefore\fP resolution of symbolic
links\&.  This call is equivalent to \fBa\fP unless your system has the
\fBrealpath\fP system call (modern systems do)\&.
.TP
\fBc\fP
Resolve a command name into an absolute path by searching the command
path given by the \fBPATH\fP variable\&.  This does not work for commands
containing directory parts\&.  Note also that this does not usually work as
a glob qualifier unless a file of the same name is found in the
current directory\&.
.TP
\fBe\fP
Remove all but the part of the filename extension following the `\fB\&.\fP\&';
see the definition of the filename extension in the description of the
\fBr\fP modifier below\&.  Note that according to that definition the result
will be empty if the string ends with a `\fB\&.\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBh\fP
Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head\&.  This works
like `\fBdirname\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBl\fP
Convert the words to all lowercase\&.
.TP
\fBp\fP
Print the new command but do not execute it\&.  Only works with history
expansion\&.
.TP
\fBq\fP
Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions\&.  Works
with history expansion and parameter expansion, though for parameters
it is only useful if the resulting text is to be re\-evaluated such as
by \fBeval\fP\&.
.TP
\fBQ\fP
Remove one level of quotes from the substituted words\&.
.TP
\fBr\fP
Remove a filename extension leaving the root name\&.  Strings with no
filename extension are not altered\&.  A filename
extension is a `\fB\&.\fP\&' followed by any number of characters (including
zero) that are neither `\fB\&.\fP\&' nor `\fB/\fP' and that continue to the end
of the string\&.  For example, the extension of
`\fBfoo\&.orig\&.c\fP\&' is `\fB\&.c\fP', and `\fBdir\&.c/foo\fP' has no extension\&.
.TP
\fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP[\fB/\fP]
Substitute \fIr\fP for \fIl\fP as described below\&.
The substitution is done only for the
first string that matches \fIl\fP\&.  For arrays and for filename
generation, this applies to each word of the expanded text\&.  See
below for further notes on substitutions\&.
.RS
.PP
The forms `\fBgs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\&' and `\fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\fB/:G\fP'
perform global substitution, i\&.e\&. substitute every occurrence of \fIr\fP
for \fIl\fP\&.  Note that the \fBg\fP or \fB:G\fP must appear in exactly the
position shown\&.
.PP
See further notes on this form of substitution below\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB&\fP
Repeat the previous \fBs\fP substitution\&.  Like \fBs\fP, may be preceded
immediately by a \fBg\fP\&.  In parameter expansion the \fB&\fP must appear
inside braces, and in filename generation it must be quoted with a
backslash\&.
.TP
\fBt\fP
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail\&.  This works
like `\fBbasename\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBu\fP
Convert the words to all uppercase\&.
.TP
\fBx\fP
Like \fBq\fP, but break into words at whitespace\&.  Does not work with
parameter expansion\&.
.PP
The \fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\fB/\fP substitution works as follows\&.  By
default the left\-hand side of substitutions are not patterns, but
character strings\&.  Any character can be used as the delimiter in place
of `\fB/\fP\&'\&.  A backslash quotes the delimiter character\&.  The character
`\fB&\fP\&', in the right\-hand\-side \fIr\fP, is replaced by the text from the
left\-hand\-side \fIl\fP\&.  The `\fB&\fP\&' can be quoted with a backslash\&.  A
null \fIl\fP uses the previous string either from the previous \fIl\fP or
from the contextual scan string \fIs\fP from `\fB!?\fP\fIs\fP\&'\&.  You can
omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline immediately follows \fIr\fP;
the rightmost `\fB?\fP\&' in a context scan can similarly be omitted\&.  Note
the same record of the last \fIl\fP and \fIr\fP is maintained across all
forms of expansion\&.
.PP
Note that if a `\fB&\fP\&' is used within glob qualifiers an extra backslash
is needed as a \fB&\fP is a special character in this case\&.
.PP
If the option \fBHIST_SUBST_PATTERN\fP is set, \fIl\fP is treated as
a pattern of the usual form described in
the section FILENAME GENERATION below\&.  This can be used in
all the places where modifiers are available; note, however, that
in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already taken place,
so parameters in the replacement string should be quoted to ensure
they are replaced at the correct time\&.
Note also that complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may
need the extended glob qualifier notation
\fB(#q:s/\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB/\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB/)\fP in order for the
shell to recognize the expression as a glob qualifier\&.  Further,
note that bad patterns in the substitution are not subject to
the \fBNO_BAD_PATTERN\fP option so will cause an error\&.
.PP
When \fBHIST_SUBST_PATTERN\fP is set, \fIl\fP may start with a \fB#\fP
to indicate that the pattern must match at the start of the string
to be substituted, and a \fB%\fP may appear at the start or after an \fB#\fP
to indicate that the pattern must match at the end of the string
to be substituted\&.  The \fB%\fP or \fB#\fP may be quoted with two
backslashes\&.
.PP
For example, the following piece of filename generation code
with the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint *\&.c(#q:s/#%(#b)s(*)\&.c/\&'S${match[1]}\&.C'/)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
takes the expansion of \fB*\&.c\fP and applies the glob qualifiers in the
\fB(#q\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP expression, which consists of a substitution
modifier anchored to the start and end of each word (\fB#%\fP)\&.  This
turns on backreferences (\fB(#b)\fP), so that the parenthesised
subexpression is available in the replacement string as \fB${match[1]}\fP\&.
The replacement string is quoted so that the parameter is not substituted
before the start of filename generation\&.
.PP
The following \fBf\fP, \fBF\fP, \fBw\fP and \fBW\fP modifiers work only with
parameter expansion and filename generation\&.  They are listed here to
provide a single point of reference for all modifiers\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBf\fP
Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following modifier until the
resulting word doesn\&'t change any more\&.
.TP
\fBF:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
Like \fBf\fP, but repeats only \fIn\fP times if the expression
\fIexpr\fP evaluates to \fIn\fP\&.  Any character can be used instead of
the `\fB:\fP\&'; if `\fB(\fP', `\fB[\fP', or `\fB{\fP'
is used as the opening delimiter,
the closing delimiter should be \&'\fB)\fP', `\fB]\fP', or `\fB}\fP',
respectively\&.
.TP
\fBw\fP
Makes the immediately following modifier work on each word in the
string\&.
.TP
\fBW:\fP\fIsep\fP\fB:\fP
Like \fBw\fP but words are considered to be the parts of the string
that are separated by \fIsep\fP\&. Any character can be used instead of
the `\fB:\fP\&'; opening parentheses are handled specially, see above\&.
.SH "PROCESS SUBSTITUTION"
Each part of a command argument that takes the form
`\fB<(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&',
`\fB>(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&' or
`\fB=(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&'
is subject to process substitution\&.  The expression may be preceded
or followed by other strings except that, to prevent clashes with
commonly occurring strings and patterns, the last
form must occur at the start of a command argument, and the forms
are only expanded when first parsing command or assignment arguments\&.
Process substitutions may be used following redirection operators; in this
case, the substitution must appear with no trailing string\&.
.PP
In the case of the \fB<\fP or \fB>\fP forms, the shell runs the commands in
\fIlist\fP as a subprocess of the job executing the shell command line\&.
If the system supports the \fB/dev/fd\fP
mechanism, the command argument is the name of the device file
corresponding to a file descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports named
pipes (FIFOs), the command argument will be a named pipe\&.  If the form with
\fB>\fP is selected then writing on this special file will provide input for
\fIlist\fP\&.  If \fB<\fP is used, then the file passed as an argument will
be connected to the output of the \fIlist\fP process\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB) |
tee >(\fP\fIprocess1\fP\fB) >(\fP\fIprocess2\fP\fB) >/dev/null\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP respectively,
pastes the results together, and sends it to the processes
\fIprocess1\fP and \fIprocess2\fP\&.
.PP
If \fB=(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP is used instead of
\fB<(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP,
then the file passed as an argument will be the name
of a temporary file containing the output of the \fIlist\fP
process\&.  This may be used instead of the \fB<\fP
form for a program that expects to lseek (see \fIlseek\fP(2))
on the input file\&.
.PP
There is an optimisation for substitutions of the form
\fB=(<<<\fP\fIarg\fP\fB)\fP, where \fIarg\fP is a single\-word argument
to the here\-string redirection \fB<<<\fP\&.  This form produces a file name
containing the value of \fIarg\fP after any substitutions have been
performed\&.  This is handled entirely within the current shell\&.  This is
effectively the reverse of the special form \fB$(<\fP\fIarg\fP\fB)\fP
which treats \fIarg\fP as a file name and replaces it with the file\&'s
contents\&.
.PP
The \fB=\fP form is useful as both the \fB/dev/fd\fP and the named pipe
implementation of \fB<(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP have drawbacks\&.  In 
the former case, some programmes may automatically close the file
descriptor in question before examining the file on the command line,
particularly if this is necessary for security reasons such as when the
programme is running setuid\&.  In the second case, if the
programme does not actually open the file, the subshell attempting to read
from or write to the pipe will (in a typical implementation, different
operating systems may have different behaviour) block for ever and have to
be killed explicitly\&.  In both cases, the shell actually supplies the
information using a pipe, so that programmes that expect to lseek
(see \fIlseek\fP(2)) on the file will not work\&.
.PP
Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and
efficiently written (provided the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is set) as:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB)\fP \e 
\fB> >(\fP\fIprocess1\fP\fB) > >(\fP\fIprocess2\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the latter
two process substitutions in the above example\&.
.PP
There is an additional problem with \fB>(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP; when
this is attached to an external command, the parent shell does not wait
for \fIprocess\fP to finish and hence an immediately following command
cannot rely on the results being complete\&.  The problem and solution are
the same as described in the section \fIMULTIOS\fP in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.  Hence in a simplified
version of the example above:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB)\fP \fB> >(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
(note that no \fBMULTIOS\fP are involved), \fIprocess\fP will be run
asynchronously as far as the parent shell is concerned\&.  The workaround is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fB{ paste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB) }\fP \fB> >(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The extra processes here are
spawned from the parent shell which will wait for their completion\&.
.PP
Another problem arises any time a job with a substitution that requires
a temporary file is disowned by the shell, including the case where
`\fB&!\fP\&' or `\fB&|\fP' appears at the end of a command containing a
substitution\&.  In that case the temporary file will not be cleaned up as
the shell no longer has any memory of the job\&.  A workaround is to use
a subshell, for example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB(mycmd =(myoutput)) &!\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
as the forked subshell will wait for the command to finish then remove
the temporary file\&.
.PP
A general workaround to ensure a process substitution endures for
an appropriate length of time is to pass it as a parameter to
an anonymous shell function (a piece of shell code that is run
immediately with function scope)\&.  For example, this code:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB() {
   print File $1:
   cat $1
} =(print This be the verse)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs something resembling the following
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBFile /tmp/zsh6nU0kS:
This be the verse\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The temporary file created by the process substitution will be deleted
when the function exits\&.
.PP
.SH "PARAMETER EXPANSION"
The character `\fB$\fP\&' is used to introduce parameter expansions\&.
See
\fIzshparam\fP(1)
for a description of parameters, including arrays, associative arrays,
and subscript notation to access individual array elements\&.
.PP
Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted parameters are not
automatically split on whitespace unless the option \fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP is
set; see references to this option below for more details\&.  This is an
important difference from other shells\&.
.PP
In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form of
the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation;
see the section `Filename Generation\&'\&.  Note that these patterns, along with
the replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion\&.
In addition to the following operations, the colon modifiers described in
the section `Modifiers\&' in the section `History Expansion' can be
applied:  for example, \fB${i:s/foo/bar/}\fP performs string
substitution on the expansion of parameter \fB$i\fP\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP
The value, if any, of the parameter \fIname\fP is substituted\&.
The braces are required if the expansion is to be followed by
a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted
as part of \fIname\fP\&.  In addition, more complicated forms of substitution
usually require the braces to be present; exceptions, which only apply if
the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not set, are a single subscript or any colon
modifiers appearing after the name, or any of the characters `\fB^\fP\&',
`\fB=\fP\&', `\fB~\fP', `\fB#\fP' or `\fB+\fP' appearing before the name, all of
which work with or without braces\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIname\fP is an array parameter, and the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is not
set, then the value of each
element of \fIname\fP is substituted, one element per word\&.  Otherwise, the

element of an array\&.  No field splitting is done on the result unless the
\fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option is set\&.

\fIlength\fP is given, substitute that many characters or elements,
otherwise the entire rest of the scalar or array\&.

A positive \fIoffset\fP is always treated as the offset of a character or

refers to the first character or element regardless of the setting of
the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP\&.

A negative offset counts backwards from the end of the scalar or array,

When positive, \fIlength\fP counts from the \fIoffset\fP position

all have the same effect, extracting the string starting at the fourth
character of \fB$foo\fP if the substitution would otherwise return a scalar,
or the array starting at the fourth element if \fB$foo\fP would return an
array\&.  Note that with the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP \fB$foo\fP always returns
a scalar (regardless of the use of the offset syntax) and a form
such as \fB$foo[*]:3\fP is required to extract elements of an array named
\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
If \fIoffset\fP is negative, the \fB\-\fP may not appear immediately
after the \fB:\fP as this indicates the
\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\-\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP form of substitution\&.  Instead, a space
may be inserted before the \fB\-\fP\&.  Furthermore, neither \fIoffset\fP nor
\fIlength\fP may begin with an alphabetic character or \fB&\fP as these are
used to indicate history\-style modifiers\&.  To substitute a value from a
variable, the recommended approach is to precede it with a \fB$\fP as this
signifies the intention (parameter substitution can easily be rendered
unreadable); however, as arithmetic substitution is performed, the
expression \fB${var: offs}\fP does work, retrieving the offset from
\fB$offs\fP\&.
.PP
For further compatibility with other shells there is a special case
for array offset 0\&.  This usually accesses to the
first element of the array\&.  However, if the substitution refers the
positional parameter array, e\&.g\&. \fB$@\fP or \fB$*\fP, then offset 0
instead refers to \fB$0\fP, offset 1 refers to \fB$1\fP, and so on\&.  In
other words, the positional parameter array is effectively extended by
prepending \fB$0\fP\&.  Hence \fB${*:0:1}\fP substitutes \fB$0\fP and
\fB${*:1:1}\fP substitutes \fB$1\fP\&.

Non\-printable characters are arbitrarily counted as zero width; how they
would actually be displayed will vary\&.

If the \fBm\fP is repeated, the character either counts zero (if it has

.SS "Rules"

Here is a summary of the rules for substitution; this assumes that braces
are present around the substitution, i\&.e\&. \fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&.  Some particular
examples are given below\&.  Note that the Zsh Development Group accepts
\fIno responsibility\fP for any brain damage which may occur during the
reading of the following rules\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB1\&.\fP \fINested substitution\fP
If multiple nested \fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP forms are present, substitution is
performed from the inside outwards\&.  At each level, the substitution takes
account of whether the current value is a scalar or an array, whether the
whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags are supplied to the
current level of substitution, just as if the nested substitution were the
outermost\&.  The flags are not propagated up to enclosing
substitutions; the nested substitution will return either a scalar or an
array as determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for quoting\&.  All the
following steps take place where applicable at all levels of substitution\&.
Note that, unless the `\fB(P)\fP\&' flag is present, the flags and any subscripts
apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for example, the
expansion \fB${${foo}}\fP behaves exactly the same as \fB${foo}\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
At each nested level of substitution, the substituted words undergo all
forms of single\-word substitution (i\&.e\&. not filename generation), including
command substitution, arithmetic expansion and filename expansion
(i\&.e\&. leading \fB~\fP and \fB=\fP)\&.  Thus, for example, \fB${${:\-=cat}:h}\fP
expands to the directory where the \fBcat\fP program resides\&.  (Explanation:
the internal substitution has no parameter but a default value \fB=cat\fP,
which is expanded by filename expansion to a full path; the outer
substitution then applies the modifier \fB:h\fP and takes the directory part
of the path\&.)
.RE
.TP
\fB2\&.\fP \fIInternal parameter flags\fP
Any parameter flags set by one of the \fBtypeset\fP family of commands,
in particular the \fBL\fP, \fBR\fP, \fBZ\fP, \fBu\fP and \fBl\fP flags for padding
and capitalization, are applied directly to the parameter value\&.
Note these flags are options to the command, e\&.g\&. `\fBtypeset \-Z\fP\&';
they are not the same as the flags used within parameter substitutions\&.
.TP
\fB3\&.\fP \fIParameter subscripting\fP
If the value is a raw parameter reference with a subscript, such as
\fB${\fP\fIvar\fP\fB[3]}\fP, the effect of subscripting is applied directly to
the parameter\&.  Subscripts are evaluated left to right; subsequent
subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the previous
subscript\&.  Thus if \fBvar\fP is an array, \fB${var[1][2]}\fP is the second
character of the first word, but \fB${var[2,4][2]}\fP is the entire third
word (the second word of the range of words two through four of the
original array)\&.  Any number of subscripts may appear\&.  Flags such as
\fB(k)\fP and \fB(v)\fP which alter the result of subscripting are applied\&.
.TP
\fB4\&.\fP \fIParameter name replacement\fP
The effect of any \fB(P)\fP flag, which treats the value so far as a
parameter name and replaces it with the corresponding value, is applied\&.
.TP
\fB5\&.\fP \fIDouble\-quoted joining\fP
If the value after this process is an array, and the substitution
appears in double quotes, and neither an \fB(@)\fP flag nor a \fB#\fP
length operator is present at the current level, then words of the
value are joined with the first character of the parameter \fB$IFS\fP,
by default a space, between each word (single word arrays are not
modified)\&.  If the \fB(j)\fP flag is present, that is used for joining
instead of \fB$IFS\fP\&.
.TP
\fB6\&.\fP \fINested subscripting\fP
Any remaining subscripts (i\&.e\&. of a nested substitution) are evaluated at
this point, based on whether the value is an array or a scalar\&.  As with
\fB3\&.\fP, multiple subscripts can appear\&.  Note that \fB${foo[2,4][2]}\fP is
thus equivalent to \fB${${foo[2,4]}[2]}\fP and also to
\fB"${${(@)foo[2,4]}[2]}"\fP (the nested substitution returns an array in
both cases), but not to \fB"${${foo[2,4]}[2]}"\fP (the nested substitution
returns a scalar because of the quotes)\&.
.TP
\fB7\&.\fP \fIModifiers\fP
Any modifiers, as specified by a trailing `\fB#\fP\&', `\fB%\fP', `\fB/\fP'
(possibly doubled) or by a set of modifiers of the form \fB:\&.\&.\&.\fP (see

The flag \fBf\fP is useful to split a double\-quoted substitution line by

an element of the resulting array\&.  Compare this with the effect of

result \fB"bar baz"\fP\&.  The outer substitution \fB"${(@)\&.\&.\&.[1]}"\fP detects
that this is a scalar, so that (despite the `\fB(@)\fP\&' flag) the subscript
picks the first character\&. 
.TP
\fB"${${(@)foo}[1]}"\fP
This produces the result `\fBbar\fP\&'\&.  In this case, the inner substitution
\fB"${(@)foo}"\fP produces the array `\fB(bar baz\fP\fB)\fP\&'\&.  The outer
substitution \fB"${\&.\&.\&.[1]}"\fP detects that this is an array and picks the
first word\&.  This is similar to the simple case \fB"${foo[1]}"\fP\&.

\fB${(s/x/)foo%%1*}\fP
produces `\fBa\fP\&' and `\fB b\fP' (note the extra space)\&.  As substitution

\fIc2\fP in whatever character sequence is used internally\&.  For
characters with code points below 128 this is US ASCII (this is the only
case most users will need)\&.  If any intervening character is not
printable, appropriate quotation is used to render it printable\&.
If the character sequence is reversed, the output is in reverse
order, e\&.g\&. `\fB{d\&.\&.a}\fP\&' is substituted as `\fBd c b a\fP'\&.
.PP
If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left
unchanged, unless the option \fBBRACE_CCL\fP (an abbreviation for `brace
character class\&') is set\&.
In that case, it is expanded to a list of the individual
characters between the braces sorted into the order of the characters
in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not currently
handled)\&.  The syntax is similar to a
\fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP expression in filename generation:
`\fB\-\fP\&' is treated specially to denote a range of characters, but `\fB^\fP' or
`\fB!\fP\&' as the first character is treated normally\&.  For example,
`\fB{abcdef0\-9}\fP\&' expands to 16 words \fB0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f\fP\&.
.PP
Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation (globbing); an
expression such as \fB*/{foo,bar}\fP is split into two separate words
\fB*/foo\fP and \fB*/bar\fP before filename generation takes place\&.  In
particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match\&' error if
\fIeither\fP of the two expressions does not match; this is to be contrasted
with \fB*/(foo|bar)\fP, which is treated as a single pattern but otherwise
has similar effects\&.

.SS "Dynamic named directories"
.PP
If the function \fBzsh_directory_name\fP exists, or the shell variable
\fBzsh_directory_name_functions\fP exists and contains an array of
function names, then the functions are used to implement dynamic
directory naming\&.  The functions are tried in order until one returns
status zero, so it is important that functions test whether they can
handle the case in question and return an appropriate status\&.
.PP
A `\fB~\fP\&' followed by a string \fInamstr\fP in unquoted square brackets is
treated specially as a dynamic directory name\&.  Note that the first
unquoted closing square bracket always terminates \fInamstr\fP\&.  The shell
function is passed two arguments: the string \fBn\fP (for name) and
\fInamstr\fP\&.  It should either set the array \fBreply\fP to a single element
which is the directory corresponding to the name and return status zero
(executing an assignment as the last statement is usually sufficient), or
it should return status non\-zero\&.  In the former case the element of reply
is used as the directory; in the latter case the substitution is deemed to
have failed\&.  If all functions fail and the option \fBNOMATCH\fP is set,
an error results\&.
.PP
The functions defined as above are also used to see if a directory can
be turned into a name, for example when printing the directory stack or
when expanding \fB%~\fP in prompts\&.  In this case each function is passed two
arguments: the string \fBd\fP (for directory) and the candidate for dynamic
naming\&.  The function should either return non\-zero status, if the
directory cannot be named by the function, or it should set the array reply
to consist of two elements: the first is the dynamic name for the directory
(as would appear within `\fB~[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'), and the second is the
prefix length of the directory to be replaced\&.  For example, if the trial
directory is \fB/home/myname/src/zsh\fP and the dynamic name for
\fB/home/myname/src\fP (which has 16 characters) is \fBs\fP, then the function
sets

parts of the directory path, as described below; it is used if the prefix

static name\&.
.PP
It is not a requirement that a function implements both
\fBn\fP and \fBd\fP calls; for example, it might be appropriate for certain
dynamic forms of expansion not to be contracted to names\&.  In that case
any call with the first argument \fBd\fP should cause a non\-zero status to
be returned\&.

The completion system calls `\fBzsh_directory_name c\fP\&' followed by
equivalent calls to elements of the array

as for any other completion function as described in

A `\fB~\fP\&' followed by anything not already covered consisting

hyphen (`\fB\-\fP\&'), or dot (`\fB\&.\fP') is looked up as a
named directory, and replaced by the value of that named directory if found\&.
Named directories are typically home directories for users on the system\&.
They may also be defined if the text after the `\fB~\fP\&' is the name
of a string shell parameter whose value begins with a `\fB/\fP\&'\&.
Note that trailing slashes will be removed from the path to the directory

`\fB~\fP\&' followed by the name of the directory\&.
The shorter of the two ways of referring to the directory is used,

.SS "Notes"
.PP
Filename expansion is performed on the right hand side of a parameter
assignment, including those appearing after commands of the
\fBtypeset\fP family\&.  In this case, the right hand side will be treated
as a colon\-separated list in the manner of the \fBPATH\fP parameter,
so that a `\fB~\fP\&' or an `\fB=\fP' following a `\fB:\fP' is eligible for expansion\&.
All such behaviour can be
disabled by quoting the `\fB~\fP\&', the `\fB=\fP', or the whole expression (but not
simply the colon); the \fBEQUALS\fP option is also respected\&.
.PP
If the option \fBMAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST\fP is set, any unquoted shell
argument in the form `\fIidentifier\fP\fB=\fP\fIexpression\fP\&' becomes eligible
for file expansion as described in the previous paragraph\&.  Quoting the

.SH "FILENAME GENERATION"
If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters
`\fB*\fP\&', `\fB(\fP', `\fB|\fP', `\fB<\fP', `\fB[\fP', or `\fB?\fP', it is regarded
as a pattern for filename generation, unless the \fBGLOB\fP option is unset\&.
If the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option is set,
the `\fB^\fP\&' and `\fB#\fP' characters also denote a pattern; otherwise
they are not treated specially by the shell\&.
.PP
The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match
the pattern\&.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives
an error message, unless the \fBNULL_GLOB\fP option is set,
in which case the word is deleted; or unless the \fBNOMATCH\fP
option is unset, in which case the word is left unchanged\&.
.PP
In filename generation,
the character `\fB/\fP\&' must be matched explicitly;
also, a `\fB\&.\fP\&' must be matched
explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or after a `\fB/\fP\&', unless the
\fBGLOB_DOTS\fP option is set\&.
No filename generation pattern

above, a `\fB/\fP\&' used as a directory separator may not appear inside
parentheses, while a `\fB|\fP\&' must do so; in patterns used in other contexts
than filename generation (for example, in \fBcase\fP statements and tests

Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching other than filename

as \fB${\fP\fIparam\fP\fB//\fP\fIpat\fP\fB/\fP\fIrepl\fP\fB}\fP, only the data for the
last match remains available\&.  In the case of global replacements this may
still be useful\&.  See the example for the \fBm\fP flag below\&.
.PP
The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the order of the opening
parentheses from left to right in the pattern string, although sets of
parentheses may be nested\&.  There are special rules for parentheses followed
by `\fB#\fP\&' or `\fB##\fP'\&.  Only the last match of the parenthesis is
remembered: for example, in `\fB[[ abab = (#b)([ab])# ]]\fP\&', only the final
`\fBb\fP\&' is stored in \fBmatch[1]\fP\&.  Thus extra parentheses may be necessary
to match the complete segment: for example, use
`\fBX((ab|cd)#)Y\fP\&' to match
a whole string of either `\fBab\fP\&' or `\fBcd\fP' between `\fBX\fP' and `\fBY\fP',
using the value of \fB$match[1]\fP rather than \fB$match[2]\fP\&.
.PP
If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so in some cases it
may be necessary to initialise them beforehand\&.  If some of the
backreferences fail to match \-\- which happens if they are in an alternate
branch which fails to match, or if they are followed by \fB#\fP and matched
zero times \-\- then the matched string is set to the empty string, and the

Approximate matching: \fInum\fP errors are allowed in the string matched by
the pattern\&.  The rules for this are described in the next subsection\&.
.TP
\fBs\fP, \fBe\fP
Unlike the other flags, these have only a local effect, and each must
appear on its own:  `\fB(#s)\fP\&' and `\fB(#e)\fP' are the only valid forms\&.
The `\fB(#s)\fP\&' flag succeeds only at the start of the test string, and the
`\fB(#e)\fP\&' flag succeeds only at the end of the test string; they
correspond to `\fB^\fP\&' and `\fB$\fP' in standard regular expressions\&.  They
are useful for matching path segments in patterns other than those in
filename generation (where path segments are in any case treated
separately)\&.  For example, `\fB*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*\fP\&' matches
a path segment `\fBtest\fP\&' in any of the following strings: \fBtest\fP,
\fBtest/at/start\fP, \fBat/end/test\fP, \fBin/test/middle\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
Another use is in parameter substitution; for example
`\fB${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}\fP\&' will remove only elements of an
array which
match the complete pattern `\fBA*Z\fP\&'\&.  There are other ways of performing
many operations of this type, however the combination of the substitution
operations `\fB/\fP\&' and `\fB//\fP' with the `\fB(#s)\fP' and `\fB(#e)\fP' flags
provides a single simple and memorable method\&.
.PP
Note that assertions of the form `\fB(^(#s))\fP\&' also work, i\&.e\&. match
anywhere except at the start of the string, although this actually means
`anything except a zero\-length portion at the start of the string\&'; you
need to use `\fB(""~(#s))\fP\&' to match a zero\-length portion of the string
not at the start\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBq\fP
A `\fBq\fP\&' and everything up to the closing parenthesis of the globbing
flags are ignored by the pattern matching code\&.  This is intended to
support the use of glob qualifiers, see below\&.  The result is that
the pattern `\fB(#b)(*)\&.c(#q\&.)\fP\&' can be used both for globbing
and for
matching against a string\&.  In the former case, the `\fB(#q\&.)\fP\&' will be
treated as a glob qualifier and the `\fB(#b)\fP\&' will not be useful, while in
the latter case the `\fB(#b)\fP\&' is useful for backreferences and the
`\fB(#q\&.)\fP\&' will be ignored\&.  Note that colon modifiers in the glob
qualifiers are also not applied in ordinary pattern matching\&.
.TP
\fBu\fP
Respect the current locale in determining the presence of multibyte
characters in a pattern, provided the shell was compiled with 
\fBMULTIBYTE_SUPPORT\fP\&.  This overrides the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP
option; the default behaviour is taken from the option\&.  Compare \fBU\fP\&.
(Mnemonic: typically multibyte characters are from Unicode in the UTF\-8
encoding, although any extension of ASCII supported by the system
library may be used\&.)
.TP
\fBU\fP
All characters are considered to be a single byte long\&.  The opposite
of \fBu\fP\&.  This overrides the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP option\&.
.PP
For example, the test string \fBfooxx\fP can be matched by the pattern
\fB(#i\fP\fB)FOOXX\fP, but not by \fB(#l\fP\fB)FOOXX\fP,
\fB(#i\fP\fB)FOO\fP\fB(#I\fP\fB)XX\fP or
\fB((#i\fP\fB)FOOX\fP\fB)X\fP\&.  The string
\fB(#ia2\fP\fB)readme\fP specifies case\-insensitive matching of
\fBreadme\fP with up to two errors\&.
.PP
When using the ksh syntax for grouping both \fBKSH_GLOB\fP and
\fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP must be set and the left parenthesis should be
preceded by \fB@\fP\&.  Note also that the flags do not affect letters
inside \fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP groups, in other words \fB(#i\fP\fB)[a\-z]\fP
still matches only lowercase letters\&.  Finally, note that when
examining whole paths case\-insensitively every directory must be
searched for all files which match, so that a pattern of the form
\fB(#i\fP\fB)/foo/bar/\&.\&.\&.\fP is potentially slow\&.
.PP
.SS "Approximate Matching"
When matching approximately, the shell keeps a count of the errors found,
which cannot exceed the number specified in the
\fB(#a\fP\fInum\fP\fB)\fP flags\&.  Four types of error are recognised:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
1\&.
Different characters, as in \fBfooxbar\fP and \fBfooybar\fP\&.
.TP
2\&.
Transposition of characters, as in \fBbanana\fP and \fBabnana\fP\&.
.TP
3\&.
A character missing in the target string, as with the pattern \fBroad\fP and
target string \fBrod\fP\&.
.TP
4\&.
An extra character appearing in the target string, as with \fBstove\fP
and \fBstrove\fP\&.
.PP
Thus, the pattern \fB(#a3\fP\fB)abcd\fP matches \fBdcba\fP, with the
errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the second once,
grouping the string as \fB[d][cb][a]\fP and \fB[a][bc][d]\fP\&.
.PP
Non\-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly, including characters
in character ranges: hence \fB(#a1\fP\fB)???\fP  matches strings of
length four, by applying rule 4 to an empty part of the pattern, but not
strings of length two, since all the \fB?\fP must match\&.  Other characters
which must match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the
\fBGLOB_DOTS\fP option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so that
\fBa/bc\fP is two errors from \fBab/c\fP (the slash cannot be transposed with
another character)\&.  Similarly, errors are counted separately for
non\-contiguous strings in the pattern, so that \fB(ab|cd\fP\fB)ef\fP
is two errors from \fBaebf\fP\&.
.PP
When using exclusion via the \fB~\fP operator, approximate matching is
treated entirely separately for the excluded part and must be activated
separately\&.  Thus, \fB(#a1\fP\fB)README~READ_ME\fP matches
\fBREAD\&.ME\fP but not \fBREAD_ME\fP, as the trailing \fBREAD_ME\fP is matched
without approximation\&.  However,
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)README~(#a1\fP\fB)READ_ME\fP
does not match any pattern of the form \fBREAD\fP\fI?\fP\fBME\fP as all
such forms are now excluded\&.
.PP
Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error count; however, the
maximum errors allowed may be altered locally, and this can be delimited by
grouping\&.  For example,
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)cat\fP\fB((#a0\fP\fB)dog\fP\fB)fox\fP
allows one error in total, which may not occur in the \fBdog\fP section, and
the pattern
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)cat\fP\fB(#a0\fP\fB)dog\fP\fB(#a1\fP\fB)fox\fP
is equivalent\&.  Note that the point at which an error is first found is the
crucial one for establishing whether to use approximation; for example,
\fB(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz\fP will not match \fBabcdxyz\fP, because the
error occurs at the `\fBx\fP\&', where approximation is turned off\&.
.PP
Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so that
`\fB(#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar\fP\&' allows one error in any path
segment\&.  This is much less efficient than without the \fB(#a1)\fP, however,
since every directory in the path must be scanned for a possible
approximate match\&.  It is best to place the \fB(#a1)\fP after any path
segments which are known to be correct\&.
.PP
.SS "Recursive Globbing"
A pathname component of the form `\fB(\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB/)#\fP\&'
matches a path consisting of zero or more directories
matching the pattern \fIfoo\fP\&.
.PP
As a shorthand, `\fB**/\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB(*/)#\fP'; note that this
therefore matches files in the current directory as well as
subdirectories\&.
Thus:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBls (*/)#bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBls **/bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
does a recursive directory search for files named `\fBbar\fP\&' (potentially
including the file `\fBbar\fP\&' in the current directory)\&.  This form does not
follow symbolic links; the alternative form `\fB***/\fP\&' does, but is
otherwise identical\&.  Neither of these can be combined with other forms of
globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the `\fB*\fP\&'
operators revert to their usual effect\&.
.SS "Glob Qualifiers"
Patterns used for filename generation may end in a
list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses\&.
The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern
will be inserted in the argument list\&.
.PP
If the option \fBBARE_GLOB_QUAL\fP is set, then a trailing set of parentheses
containing no `\fB|\fP\&' or `\fB(\fP' characters (or `\fB~\fP' if it is special)
is taken as a set of
glob qualifiers\&.  A glob subexpression that would normally be taken as glob
qualifiers, for example `\fB(^x)\fP\&', can be forced to be treated as part of
the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in this case producing
`\fB((^x))\fP\&'\&.
.PP
If the option \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP is set, a different syntax for glob
qualifiers is available, namely `\fB(#q\fP\fIx\fP\fB)\fP\&'
where \fIx\fP is any of the same
glob qualifiers used in the other format\&.  The qualifiers must still appear
at the end of the pattern\&.  However, with this syntax multiple glob
qualifiers may be chained together\&.  They are treated as a logical AND of
the individual sets of flags\&.  Also, as the syntax is unambiguous, the
expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long any parentheses
contained within it are balanced; appearance of `\fB|\fP\&', `\fB(\fP' or
`\fB~\fP\&' does not negate the effect\&.  Note that qualifiers will be
recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of
the pattern, for example `\fB*(#q*)(\&.)\fP\&' will recognise executable regular
files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably be
avoided for the sake of clarity\&.  Note that within conditions using the
`\fB[[\fP\&' form the presence of a parenthesised expression
\fB(#q\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP at the end of a string indicates that globbing
should be performed; the expression may include glob qualifiers, but
it is also valid if it is simply \fB(#q)\fP\&.  This does
not apply to the right hand side of pattern match operators as the
syntax already has special significance\&.
.PP
A qualifier may be any one of the following:

\fBf\fP\fIspec\fP
files with access rights matching \fIspec\fP\&. This \fIspec\fP may be a
octal number optionally preceded by a `\fB=\fP\&', a `\fB+\fP', or a
`\fB\-\fP\&'\&. If none of these characters is given, the behavior is the
same as for `\fB=\fP\&'\&. The octal number describes the mode bits to be
expected, if combined with a `\fB=\fP\&', the value given must match the
file\-modes exactly, with a `\fB+\fP\&', at least the bits in the
given number must be set in the file\-modes, and with a `\fB\-\fP\&', the
bits in the number must not be set\&. Giving a `\fB?\fP\&' instead of a
octal digit anywhere in the number ensures that the corresponding bits 
in the file\-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination
with `\fB=\fP\&'\&.
.RS
.PP
If the qualifier `\fBf\fP\&' is followed by any other character anything
up to the next matching character (`\fB[\fP\&', `\fB{\fP', and `\fB<\fP' match 
`\fB]\fP\&', `\fB}\fP', and `\fB>\fP' respectively, any other character
matches itself) is taken as a list of comma\-separated
\fIsub\-spec\fPs\&. Each \fIsub\-spec\fP may be either an octal number as
described above or a list of any of the characters `\fBu\fP\&', `\fBg\fP',
`\fBo\fP\&', and `\fBa\fP', followed by a `\fB=\fP', a `\fB+\fP', or a
`\fB\-\fP\&', followed by a list of any of the characters `\fBr\fP', `\fBw\fP', 
`\fBx\fP\&', `\fBs\fP', and `\fBt\fP', or an octal digit\&. The first list of
characters specify which access rights are to be checked\&. If a `\fBu\fP\&'
is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a `\fBg\fP\&' is
given, those of the group are checked, a `\fBo\fP\&' means to test those
of other users, and the `\fBa\fP\&' says to test all three groups\&. The
`\fB=\fP\&', `\fB+\fP', and `\fB\-\fP' again says how the modes are to be
checked and have the same meaning as described for the first form
above\&. The second list of characters finally says which access rights
are to be expected: `\fBr\fP\&' for read access, `\fBw\fP' for write access, 
`\fBx\fP\&' for the right to execute the file (or to search a directory),
`\fBs\fP\&' for the setuid and setgid bits, and `\fBt\fP' for the sticky
bit\&.
.PP
Thus, `\fB*(f70?)\fP\&' gives the files for which the owner has read,
write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have
no rights, independent of the permissions for other users\&. The pattern
`\fB*(f\-100)\fP\&' gives all files for which the owner does not have
execute permission, and `\fB*(f:gu+w,o\-rx:)\fP\&' gives the files for which 
the owner and the other members of the group have at least write
permission, and for which other users don\&'t have read or execute
permission\&.

In the first form, the first character after the `\fBe\fP\&'

`\fB]\fP\&', `\fB}\fP', and `\fB>\fP', respectively, while any other character
matches itself\&. Note that expansions must be quoted in the \fIstring\fP
to prevent them from being expanded before globbing is done\&.
\fIstring\fP is then executed as shell code\&.  The string \fBglobqual\fP
is appended to the array \fBzsh_eval_context\fP the duration of
execution\&.
.PP
During the execution of \fIstring\fP the filename currently being tested is
available in the parameter \fBREPLY\fP; the parameter may be altered to
a string to be inserted into the list instead of the original
filename\&.  In addition, the parameter \fBreply\fP may be set to an array or a
string, which overrides the value of \fBREPLY\fP\&.  If set to an array, the
latter is inserted into the command line word by word\&.
.PP
For example, suppose a directory contains a single file `\fBlonely\fP\&'\&.  Then
the expression `\fB*(e:\&'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)\fP' will cause the words
`\fBlonely1\fP\&' and `\fBlonely2\fP' to be inserted into the command line\&.  Note
the quoting of \fIstring\fP\&.
.PP
The form \fB+\fP\fIcmd\fP has the same effect, but no delimiters appear
around \fIcmd\fP\&.  Instead, \fIcmd\fP is taken as the longest sequence of
characters following the \fB+\fP that are alphanumeric or underscore\&.

The starting separators `\fB[\fP\&', `\fB{\fP', and `\fB<\fP'

If a `\fB:\fP\&' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in

have to be an existing file\&.  The name of any existing file can be followed
by a modifier of the form `\fB(:\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\&'

is performed, although note that the presence of the parentheses

.SH "SIMPLE COMMANDS & PIPELINES"
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional parameter
assignments followed by blank\-separated words,
with optional redirections interspersed\&.  For a description
of assignment, see the beginning of
\fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining
words, if any, are arguments to the command\&.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed\&.
The value of a simple command is its exit status,
or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a simple command with arguments\&.
.PP
A \fIpipeline\fP is either a simple command, or a sequence of two or more
simple commands where each command is separated from the next by `\fB|\fP\&'
or `\fB|&\fP\&'\&.  Where commands are separated by `\fB|\fP', the standard
output of the first command is connected to the
standard input of the next\&.  `\fB|&\fP\&' is shorthand for `\fB2>&1 |\fP', which
connects both the standard output and the standard error of the
command to the standard input of the next\&.  The value of a pipeline
is the value of the last command, unless the pipeline is preceded by
`\fB!\fP\&' in which case the value is the logical inverse of the value of the
last command\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho foo | sed \&'s/foo/bar/'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a pipeline, where the output (`\fBfoo\fP\&' plus a newline) of the first
command will be passed to the input of the second\&.
.PP
If a pipeline is preceded by `\fBcoproc\fP\&', it is executed as a coprocess;
a two\-way pipe is established between it and the parent shell\&.  The
shell can read from or write to the coprocess by means of the `\fB>&p\fP\&'
and `\fB<&p\fP\&' redirection operators or with `\fBprint \-p\fP' and `\fBread \-p\fP'\&.
A pipeline cannot be preceded by both `\fBcoproc\fP\&' and `\fB!\fP'\&.
If job control is active, the coprocess can be treated in other than input
and output as an ordinary background job\&.
.PP
A \fIsublist\fP is either a single pipeline, or a sequence of two or more
pipelines separated by `\fB&&\fP\&' or `\fB||\fP'\&.  If two pipelines are separated
by `\fB&&\fP\&', the second pipeline is executed only if the first succeeds
(returns a zero status)\&.  If two pipelines are separated by `\fB||\fP\&', the
second is executed only if the first fails (returns a nonzero status)\&.
Both operators have equal precedence and are left associative\&.
The value of the sublist is the value of the last pipeline executed\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdmesg | grep panic && print yes\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a sublist consisting of two pipelines, the second just a simple command
which will be executed if and only if the \fBgrep\fP command returns a zero
status\&.  If it does not, the value of the sublist is that return status, else
it is the status returned by the \fBprint\fP (almost certainly zero)\&.
.PP
A \fIlist\fP is a sequence of zero or more sublists, in which each sublist
is terminated by `\fB;\fP\&', `\fB&\fP', `\fB&|\fP', `\fB&!\fP', or a newline\&.
This terminator
may optionally be omitted from the last sublist in the list when the
list appears as a complex command inside `\fB(\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&'
or `\fB{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP\&'\&.  When a
sublist is terminated by `\fB;\fP\&' or newline, the shell waits for it to
finish before executing the next sublist\&.  If a sublist is terminated
by a `\fB&\fP\&', `\fB&|\fP', or `\fB&!\fP',
the shell executes the last pipeline in it in the background, and
does not wait for it to finish (note the difference from other shells
which execute the whole sublist in the background)\&.
A backgrounded pipeline returns a status of zero\&.
.PP
More generally, a list can be seen as a set of any shell commands
whatsoever, including the complex commands below; this is implied wherever
the word `list\&' appears in later descriptions\&.  For example, the commands
in a shell function form a special sort of list\&.
.SH "PRECOMMAND MODIFIERS"
A simple command may be preceded by a \fIprecommand modifier\fP,
which will alter how the command is interpreted\&.  These modifiers are
shell builtin commands with the exception of \fBnocorrect\fP which is
a reserved word\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-\fP
The command is executed with a `\fB\-\fP\&' prepended to its
\fBargv[0]\fP string\&.
.TP
\fBbuiltin\fP
The command word is taken to be the name of a builtin command,
rather than a shell function or external command\&.
.TP
\fBcommand\fP [ \fB\-pvV\fP ]
The command word is taken to be the name of an external command,
rather than a shell function or builtin\&.   If the \fBPOSIX_BUILTINS\fP option
is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties
of them are suppressed\&. The \fB\-p\fP flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in \fB$path\fP\&. With the \fB\-v\fP flag, \fBcommand\fP
is similar to \fBwhence\fP and with \fB\-V\fP, it is equivalent to \fBwhence
\-v\fP\&.
.TP
\fBexec\fP [ \fB\-cl\fP ] [ \fB\-a\fP \fIargv0\fP ]
The following command together with any arguments is run in place
of the current process, rather than as a sub\-process\&.  The shell does not
fork and is replaced\&.  The shell does not invoke \fBTRAPEXIT\fP, nor does it
source \fBzlogout\fP files\&.
The options are provided for compatibility with other shells\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB\-c\fP option clears the environment\&.
.PP
The \fB\-l\fP option is equivalent to the \fB\-\fP precommand modifier, to
treat the replacement command as a login shell; the command is executed
with a \fB\-\fP prepended to its \fBargv[0]\fP string\&.  This flag has no effect
if used together with the \fB\-a\fP option\&.
.PP
The \fB\-a\fP option is used to specify explicitly the \fBargv[0]\fP string
(the name of the command as seen by the process itself) to be used by the
replacement command and is directly equivalent to setting a value
for the \fBARGV0\fP environment variable\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBnocorrect\fP
Spelling correction is not done on any of the words\&.  This must appear
before any other precommand modifier, as it is interpreted immediately,
before any parsing is done\&.  It has no effect in non\-interactive shells\&.

the \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP is executed\&.

\fIname\fP to each of them in turn, executing
\fIlist\fP each time\&.  If the \fBin\fP \fIword\fP is omitted,

.RS
.PP
More than one parameter \fIname\fP can appear before the list of
\fIword\fPs\&.  If \fIN\fP \fIname\fPs are given, then on each execution of the
loop the next \fIN\fP \fIword\fPs are assigned to the corresponding
parameters\&.  If there are more \fIname\fPs than remaining \fIword\fPs, the
remaining parameters are each set to the empty string\&.  Execution of the
loop ends when there is no remaining \fIword\fP to assign to the first
\fIname\fP\&.  It is only possible for \fBin\fP to appear as the first \fIname\fP
in the list, else it will be treated as marking the end of the list\&.
.RE
.TP

the section `Arithmetic Evaluation\&')\&.  The arithmetic expression
\fIexpr2\fP is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and
when non\-zero, \fIlist\fP is executed and the arithmetic expression
\fIexpr3\fP evaluated\&.  If any expression is omitted, then it behaves

.RS
.PP
Note further that, unless the \fBSH_GLOB\fP option is set, the whole
pattern with alternatives is treated by the shell as equivalent to a
group of patterns within parentheses, although white space may appear
about the parentheses and the vertical bar and will be stripped from the
pattern at those points\&.  White space may appear elsewhere in the
pattern; this is not stripped\&.  If the \fBSH_GLOB\fP option is set, so
that an opening parenthesis can be unambiguously treated as part of the
case syntax, the expression is parsed into separate words and these are
treated as strict alternatives (as in other shells)\&.

execute \fIalways\-list\fP\&.  Execution then continues from the
result of the execution of \fItry\-list\fP; in other words, any error,
or \fBbreak\fP, \fBcontinue\fP, or \fBreturn\fP command is treated in the
normal way, as if \fIalways\-list\fP were not present\&.  The two
chunks of code are referred to as the `try block\&' and the `always block'\&.
.RS
.PP
Optional newlines or semicolons may appear after the \fBalways\fP;
note, however, that they may \fInot\fP appear between the preceding
closing brace and the \fBalways\fP\&.
.PP
An `error\&' in this context is a condition such as a syntax error which
causes the shell to abort execution of the current function, script, or
list\&.  Syntax errors encountered while the shell is parsing the
code do not cause the \fIalways\-list\fP to be executed\&.  For example,
an erroneously constructed \fBif\fP block in \fBtry\-list\fP would cause the
shell to abort during parsing, so that \fBalways\-list\fP would not be
executed, while an erroneous substitution such as \fB${*foo*}\fP would
cause a run\-time error, after which \fBalways\-list\fP would be executed\&.
.PP
An error condition can be tested and reset with the special integer
variable \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP\&.  Outside an \fBalways\-list\fP the value is
irrelevant, but it is initialised to \fB\-1\fP\&.  Inside \fBalways\-list\fP, the
value is 1 if an error occurred in the \fBtry\-list\fP, else 0\&.  If
\fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP is set to 0 during the \fBalways\-list\fP, the error
condition caused by the \fBtry\-list\fP is reset, and shell execution
continues normally after the end of \fBalways\-list\fP\&.  Altering the value
during the \fBtry\-list\fP is not useful (unless this forms part of an
enclosing \fBalways\fP block)\&.
.PP
Regardless of \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP, after the end of \fBalways\-list\fP the
normal shell status \fB$?\fP is the value returned from \fBtry\-list\fP\&.
This will be non\-zero if there was an error, even if \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP

.SH "ERRORS"
Certain errors are treated as fatal by the shell: in an interactive
shell, they cause control to return to the command line, and in a
non\-interactive shell they cause the shell to be aborted\&.  In older
versions of zsh, a non\-interactive shell running a script would not
abort completely, but would resume execution at the next command to be
read from the script, skipping the remainder of any functions or
shell constructs such as loops or conditions; this somewhat illogical
behaviour can be recovered by setting the option \fBCONTINUE_ON_ERROR\fP\&.

.SH "COMMENTS"
In non\-interactive shells, or in interactive shells with the
\fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP option set, a word beginning
with the third character of the \fBhistchars\fP parameter
(`\fB#\fP\&' by default) causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored\&.
.SH "ALIASING"
Every eligible \fIword\fP in the shell input is checked to see if there
is an alias defined for it\&.
If so, it is replaced by the text of the alias if it is in command
position (if it could be the first word of a simple command),
or if the alias is global\&.
If the replacement text ends with a space, the next word in the shell input
is always eligible for purposes of alias expansion\&.
An alias is defined using the \fBalias\fP builtin; global aliases
may be defined using the \fB\-g\fP option to that builtin\&.
.PP
A \fIword\fP is defined as:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
Any plain string or glob pattern
.TP
\(bu
Any quoted string, using any quoting method (note that the quotes
must be part of the alias definition for this to be eligible)

.TP

other tokens between them
.TP
\(bu
Any reserved word (\fBcase\fP, \fBdo\fP, \fBelse\fP, etc\&.)
.TP
\(bu
With global aliasing, any command separator, any redirection
operator, and `\fB(\fP\&' or `\fB)\fP' when not part of a glob pattern
.PP
It is not presently possible to alias the `\fB((\fP\&' token that
introduces arithmetic expressions, because until a full statement has been
parsed, it cannot be distinguished from two consecutive `\fB(\fP\&'
tokens introducing nested subshells\&.
.PP
When \fBPOSIX_ALIASES\fP is set, only plain unquoted strings are eligible
for aliasing\&.  The \fBalias\fP builtin does not reject ineligible aliases,
but they are not expanded\&.
.PP
Alias expansion is done on the shell input before any other expansion
except history expansion\&.  Therefore, if an alias is defined for the
word \fBfoo\fP, alias expansion may be avoided by quoting part of the
word, e\&.g\&. \fB\efoo\fP\&.  Any form of quoting works, although there is
nothing to prevent an alias being defined for the quoted form such as
\fB\efoo\fP as well\&.  Also, if a separator such as \fB&&\fP is aliased,
\fB\e&&\fP turns into the two tokens \fB\e&\fP and \fB&\fP, each of which may
have been aliased separately\&.  Similarly for \fB\e<<\fP, \fB\e>|\fP, etc\&.
.PP
For use with completion, which would remove an initial backslash followed
by a character that isn\&'t special, it may be more convenient to quote the
word by starting with a single quote, i\&.e\&. \fB\&'foo\fP; completion will
automatically add the trailing single quote\&.
.PP
There is a commonly encountered problem with aliases
illustrated by the following code:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias echobar=\&'echo bar'; echobar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This prints a message that the command \fBechobar\fP could not be found\&.
This happens because aliases are expanded when the code is read in;
the entire line is read in one go, so that when \fBechobar\fP is executed it
is too late to expand the newly defined alias\&.  This is often
a problem in shell scripts, functions, and code executed with `\fBsource\fP\&'
or `\fB\&.\fP\&'\&.  Consequently, use of functions rather than aliases is
recommended in non\-interactive code\&.
.PP
Note also the unhelpful interaction of aliases and function definitions:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias func=\&'noglob func'
func() {
    echo Do something with $*
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Because aliases are expanded in function definitions, this causes the
following command to be executed:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBnoglob func() {
    echo Do something with $*
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
which defines \fBnoglob\fP as well as \fBfunc\fP as functions with the
body given\&.  To avoid this, either quote the name \fBfunc\fP or use the
alternative function definition form `\fBfunction func\fP\&'\&.  Ensuring the
alias is defined after the function works but is problematic if the
code fragment might be re\-executed\&.
.PP
.SH "QUOTING"
A character may be \fIquoted\fP (that is, made
to stand for itself) by preceding it with a `\fB\e\fP\&'\&.
`\fB\e\fP\&' followed by a newline is ignored\&.
.PP
A string enclosed between `\fB$\&'\fP' and `\fB'\fP' is
processed the same way as the string arguments of the
\fBprint\fP builtin, and the resulting string is considered to be
entirely quoted\&.  A literal `\fB\&'\fP' character can be included in the
string by using the `\fB\e\&'\fP' escape\&.
.PP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes (\fB\&''\fP) that
is not preceded by a `\fB$\fP\&' are quoted\&.  A single quote cannot appear
within single quotes unless the option \fBRC_QUOTES\fP is set, in which case
a pair of single quotes are turned into a single quote\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint \&''''\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs nothing apart from a newline if \fBRC_QUOTES\fP is not set, but one
single quote if it is set\&.
.PP
Inside double quotes (\fB""\fP), parameter and
command substitution occur, and `\fB\e\fP\&' quotes the characters
`\fB\e\fP\&', `\fB`\fP', `\fB"\fP', and `\fB$\fP'\&.

If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file
descriptor referred to is that specified by the digit
instead of the default 0 or 1\&.
The order in which redirections are specified is significant\&.
The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
(\fIfile descriptor\fP, \fIfile\fP)
association at the time of evaluation\&.

redirection\&.  For example, if \fIword\fP in an output redirection is of the

command represented by \fIlist\fP\&.  See

.SH "OPENING FILE DESCRIPTORS USING PARAMETERS"
.PP
When the shell is parsing arguments to a command, and the shell option
\fBIGNORE_BRACES\fP is not set, a different form of redirection is allowed:
instead of a digit before the operator there is a valid shell identifier
enclosed in braces\&.  The shell will open a new file descriptor that
is guaranteed to be at least 10 and set the parameter named by the
identifier to the file descriptor opened\&.  No whitespace is allowed
between the closing brace and the redirection character\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\&.\&.\&. \fB{myfd}>&1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This opens a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of file descriptor
1 and sets the parameter \fBmyfd\fP to the number of the file descriptor,
which will be at least 10\&.  The new file descriptor can be written to using
the syntax \fB>&$myfd\fP\&.
.PP
The syntax \fB{\fP\fIvarid\fP\fB}>&\-\fP, for example \fB{myfd}>&\-\fP, may be used
to close a file descriptor opened in this fashion\&.  Note that the
parameter given by \fIvarid\fP must previously be set to a file descriptor
in this case\&.
.PP
It is an error to open or close a file descriptor in this fashion when the
parameter is readonly\&.  However, it is not an error to read or write a file
descriptor using \fB<&$\fP\fIparam\fP or \fB>&$\fP\fIparam\fP if \fIparam\fP is
readonly\&.
.PP
If the option \fBCLOBBER\fP is unset, it is an error to open a file
descriptor using a parameter that is already set to an open file descriptor
previously allocated by this mechanism\&.  Unsetting the parameter before
using it for allocating a file descriptor avoids the error\&.
.PP
Note that this mechanism merely allocates or closes a file descriptor; it
does not perform any redirections from or to it\&.  It is usually convenient
to allocate a file descriptor prior to use as an argument to \fBexec\fP\&.
The syntax does not in any case work when used around complex commands
such as parenthesised subshells or loops, where the opening brace is
interpreted as part of a command list to be executed in the current shell\&.
.PP
The following shows a typical sequence of allocation, use, and closing of a
file descriptor:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBinteger myfd
exec {myfd}>~/logs/mylogfile\&.txt
print This is a log message\&. >&$myfd
exec {myfd}>&\-\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that the expansion of the variable in the expression \fB>&$myfd\fP
occurs at the point the redirection is opened\&.  This is after the expansion
of command arguments and after any redirections to the left on the command
line have been processed\&.
.SH "MULTIOS"
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
its input to all the specified outputs, similar to \fBtee\fP,
provided the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is set, as it is by default\&.  Thus:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdate >foo >bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
writes the date to two files, named `\fBfoo\fP\&' and `\fBbar\fP'\&.
Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus

.fi
.RE
.PP

.PP
will truncate all files in the current directory,

Similarly, you can do
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho exit 0 >> *\&.sh\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies

The reason for this is that the multios are spawned after the \fBcat\fP
process is forked from the parent shell, so the parent shell does not
wait for the multios to finish writing data\&.  This means the command as
shown can exit before \fBfile1\fP and \fBfile2\fP are completely written\&.

Otherwise, the shell searches each element of \fB$path\fP for a
directory containing an executable file by that name\&.  If the
search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns
a nonzero exit status\&.
.PP
If execution fails because the file is not in executable format,

script\&.  \fB/bin/sh\fP is spawned to execute it\&.  If the program

execute the specified interpreter on operating systems that do
not handle this executable format in the kernel\&.

If no external command is found but a function \fBcommand_not_found_handler\fP
exists the shell executes this function with all
command line arguments\&.  The function should return status zero if it
successfully handled the command, or non\-zero status if it failed\&.
In the latter case the standard handling is applied: `command not
found\&' is printed to standard error and the shell exits with status 127\&.

and present working directory with the
caller\&.  A trap on \fBEXIT\fP set inside a function
is executed after the function completes in the environment
of the caller\&.
.PP
The \fBreturn\fP builtin is used to return from function calls\&.
.PP
Function identifiers can be listed with the \fBfunctions\fP builtin\&.
Functions can be undefined with the \fBunfunction\fP builtin\&.
.SH "AUTOLOADING FUNCTIONS"
.PP
A function can be marked as \fIundefined\fP using the \fBautoload\fP builtin
(or `\fBfunctions \-u\fP\&' or `\fBtypeset \-fu\fP')\&.  Such a function has no
body\&.  When the function is first executed, the shell searches for its
definition using the elements of the \fBfpath\fP variable\&.  Thus to define
functions for autoloading, a typical sequence is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfpath=(~/myfuncs $fpath)
autoload myfunc1 myfunc2 \&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The usual alias expansion during reading will be suppressed if the
\fBautoload\fP builtin or its equivalent is given the option \fB\-U\fP\&. This is
recommended for the use of functions supplied with the zsh distribution\&.
Note that for functions precompiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin command
the flag \fB\-U\fP must be provided when the \fB\&.zwc\fP file is created, as the
corresponding information is compiled into the latter\&.
.PP
For each \fIelement\fP in \fBfpath\fP, the shell looks for three possible
files, the newest of which is used to load the definition for the function:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fIelement\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP
A file created with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin command, which is expected to
contain the definitions for all functions in the directory named
\fIelement\fP\&.  The file is treated in the same manner as a directory
containing files for functions and is searched for the definition of the
function\&.   If the definition is not found, the search for a definition
proceeds with the other two possibilities described below\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIelement\fP already includes a \fB\&.zwc\fP extension (i\&.e\&. the extension
was explicitly given by the user), \fIelement\fP is searched for the
definition of the function without comparing its age to that of other
files; in fact, there does not need to be any directory named \fIelement\fP
without the suffix\&.  Thus including an element such as
`\fB/usr/local/funcs\&.zwc\fP\&' in \fBfpath\fP will speed up the search for
functions, with the disadvantage that functions included must be explicitly
recompiled by hand before the shell notices any changes\&.
.RE
.TP
\fIelement\fP\fB/\fP\fIfunction\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP
A file created with \fBzcompile\fP, which is expected to contain the
definition for \fIfunction\fP\&.  It may include other function definitions
as well, but those are neither loaded nor executed; a file found in this
way is searched \fIonly\fP for the definition of \fIfunction\fP\&.
.TP
\fIelement\fP\fB/\fP\fIfunction\fP
A file of zsh command text, taken to be the definition for \fIfunction\fP\&.
.PP
In summary, the order of searching is, first, in the \fIparents of\fP
directories in \fBfpath\fP for the newer of either a compiled directory or
a directory in \fBfpath\fP; second, if more than one of these contains a
definition for the function that is sought, the leftmost in the \fBfpath\fP
is chosen; and third, within a directory, the newer of either a compiled
function or an ordinary function definition is used\&.
.PP
If the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option is set, or the file contains only a
simple definition of the function, the file\&'s contents will be executed\&.
This will normally define the function in question, but may also perform
initialization, which is executed in the context of the function execution,
and may therefore define local parameters\&.  It is an error if the function
is not defined by loading the file\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the function body (with no surrounding `\fIfuncname\fP\fB()
{\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&') is taken to be the complete contents of the file\&.  This
form allows the file to be used directly as an executable shell script\&.  If
processing of the file results in the function being re\-defined, the
function itself is not re\-executed\&.  To force the shell to perform
initialization and then call the function defined, the file should contain
initialization code (which will be executed then discarded) in addition to
a complete function definition (which will be retained for subsequent calls
to the function), and a call to the shell function, including any
arguments, at the end\&.
.PP
For example, suppose the autoload file \fBfunc\fP contains
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfunc() { print This is func; }
print func is initialized
\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
then `\fBfunc; func\fP\&' with \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP set will produce both messages
on the first call, but only the message `\fBThis is func\fP\&' on the second
and subsequent calls\&.  Without \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP set, it will produce
the initialization message on the first call, and the other message on the
second and subsequent calls\&.
.PP
It is also possible to create a function that is not marked as autoloaded,
but which loads its own definition by searching \fBfpath\fP, by using
`\fBautoload \-X\fP\&' within a shell function\&.  For example, the following are
equivalent:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmyfunc() {
  autoload \-X
}
myfunc args\&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunfunction myfunc   # if myfunc was defined
autoload myfunc
myfunc args\&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In fact, the \fBfunctions\fP command outputs `\fBbuiltin autoload \-X\fP\&' as
the body of an autoloaded function\&.  This is done so that
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBeval "$(functions)"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
produces a reasonable result\&.  A true autoloaded function can be
identified by the presence of the comment `\fB# undefined\fP\&' in the body,
because all comments are discarded from defined functions\&.
.PP
To load the definition of an autoloaded function \fBmyfunc\fP without
executing \fBmyfunc\fP, use:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload +X myfunc\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SH "ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS"
.PP
If no name is given for a function, it is `anonymous\&' and is handled
specially\&.  Either form of function definition may be used: a `\fB()\fP\&' with
no preceding name, or a `\fBfunction\fP\&' with an immediately following open
brace\&.  The function is executed immediately at the point of definition and
is not stored for future use\&.  The function name is set to `\fB(anon)\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Arguments to the function may be specified as words following the
closing brace defining the function, hence if there are none no
arguments (other than \fB$0\fP) are set\&.  This is a difference from the
way other functions are parsed: normal function definitions may be
followed by certain keywords such as `\fBelse\fP\&' or `\fBfi\fP', which will
be treated as arguments to anonymous functions, so that a newline or
semicolon is needed to force keyword interpretation\&.
.PP
Note also that the argument list of any enclosing script or function is
hidden (as would be the case for any other function called at this
point)\&.
.PP
Redirections may be applied to the anonymous function in the same manner as
to a current\-shell structure enclosed in braces\&.  The main use of anonymous
functions is to provide a scope for local variables\&.  This is particularly
convenient in start\-up files as these do not provide their own local
variable scope\&.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBvariable=outside
function {
  local variable=inside
  print "I am $variable with arguments $*"
} this and that
print "I am $variable"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBI am inside with arguments this and that
I am outside\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that function definitions with arguments that expand to nothing,
for example `\fBname=; function $name { \fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB }\fP\&', are not
treated as anonymous functions\&.  Instead, they are treated as normal
function definitions where the definition is silently discarded\&.
.PP
.SH "SPECIAL FUNCTIONS"
Certain functions, if defined, have special meaning to the shell\&.
.PP
.SS "Hook Functions"
.PP
For the functions below, it is possible to define an array that has the
same name as the function with `\fB_functions\fP\&' appended\&.  Any element in
such an array is taken as the name of a function to execute; it is executed
in the same context and with the same arguments as the basic function\&.  For
example, if \fB$chpwd_functions\fP is an array containing the values
`\fBmychpwd\fP\&', `\fBchpwd_save_dirstack\fP', then the shell attempts to
execute the functions `\fBchpwd\fP\&', `\fBmychpwd\fP' and
`\fBchpwd_save_dirstack\fP\&', in that order\&.  Any function that does not exist
is silently ignored\&.  A function found by this mechanism is referred to
elsewhere as a `hook function\&'\&.  An error in any function causes subsequent
functions not to be run\&.  Note further that an error in a \fBprecmd\fP hook
causes an immediately following \fBperiodic\fP function not to run (though
it may run at the next opportunity)\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBchpwd\fP
Executed whenever the current working directory is changed\&.
.TP
\fBperiodic\fP
If the parameter \fBPERIOD\fP
is set, this function is executed every \fB$PERIOD\fP
seconds, just before a prompt\&.  Note that if multiple functions
are defined using the array \fBperiodic_functions\fP only one
period is applied to the complete set of functions, and the
scheduled time is not reset if the list of functions is altered\&.
Hence the set of functions is always called together\&.
.TP
\fBprecmd\fP
Executed before each prompt\&.  Note that precommand functions are not
re\-executed simply because the command line is redrawn, as happens, for
example, when a notification about an exiting job is displayed\&.
.TP
\fBpreexec\fP
Executed just after a command has been read and is about to be
executed\&.  If the history mechanism is active (regardless of whether the
line was discarded from the history buffer), the string that the user
typed is passed as the first argument, otherwise it is an empty string\&.
The actual command that will be executed (including expanded aliases) is
passed in two different forms: the second argument is a single\-line,
size\-limited version of the command (with things like function bodies
elided); the third argument contains the full text that is being
executed\&.
.TP
\fBzshaddhistory\fP
Executed when a history line has been read interactively, but
before it is executed\&.  The sole argument is the complete history
line (so that any terminating newline will still be present)\&.
.RS
.PP
If any of the hook functions returns status 1 (or any non\-zero value
other than 2, though this is not guaranteed for future versions of the
shell) the history line will not be saved, although it lingers in the
history until the next line is executed, allowing you to reuse or edit
it immediately\&.
.PP
If any of the hook functions returns status 2 the history line
will be saved on the internal history list, but not written to
the history file\&.  In case of a conflict, the first non\-zero status
value is taken\&.
.PP
A hook function may call `\fBfc \-p\fP \fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' to switch the history
context so that the history is saved in a different file from the
that in the global \fBHISTFILE\fP parameter\&.  This is handled specially:
the history context is automatically restored after the processing
of the history line is finished\&.
.PP
The following example function works with one of the options
\fBINC_APPEND_HISTORY\fP or \fBSHARE_HISTORY\fP set, in order that the line
is written out immediately after the history entry is added\&.  It first
adds the history line to the normal history with the newline stripped,
which is usually the correct behaviour\&.  Then it switches the history
context so that the line will be written to a history file in the
current directory\&.

Executed at the point where the main shell is about to exit normally\&.

precommand modifier is used before an external command\&.  Also, unlike
\fBTRAPEXIT\fP, it is not called when functions exit\&.

hook arrays\&.

\fBTRAP\fP\fINAL\fP
If defined and non\-null,
this function will be executed whenever the shell
catches a signal \fBSIG\fP\fINAL\fP, where \fINAL\fP is a signal
name as specified for the \fBkill\fP builtin\&.
The signal number will be passed as the first parameter to the function\&.
.RS
.PP
If a function of this form is defined and null,
the shell and processes spawned by it will ignore \fBSIG\fP\fINAL\fP\&.
.PP
The return status from the function is handled specially\&.  If it is
zero, the signal is assumed to have been handled, and execution continues
normally\&.  Otherwise, the shell will behave as interrupted except that
the return status of the trap is retained\&.
.PP
Programs terminated by uncaught signals typically return the status 128
plus the signal number\&.  Hence the following causes the handler for
\fBSIGINT\fP to print a message, then mimic the usual effect of the signal\&.

before each command; otherwise executed after each command\&.  See

\fIzshbuiltins\fP(1) for details of additional features provided
in debug traps\&.
.TP
\fBTRAPEXIT\fP
Executed when the shell exits,
or when the current function exits if defined inside a function\&.
The value of \fB$?\fP at the start of execution is the exit status of the
shell or the return status of the function exiting\&.
.TP
\fBTRAPZERR\fP
Executed whenever a command has a non\-zero exit status\&.  However, the
function is not executed if the command occurred in a sublist followed by
`\fB&&\fP\&' or `\fB||\fP'; only the final command in a sublist of this type
causes the trap to be executed\&.  The function \fBTRAPERR\fP acts the same as
\fBTRAPZERR\fP on systems where there is no \fBSIGERR\fP (this is the usual
case)\&.
.PP
The functions beginning `\fBTRAP\fP\&' may alternatively be defined with the
\fBtrap\fP builtin:  this may be preferable for some uses\&.  Setting a trap

.SH "JOBS"
If the \fBMONITOR\fP option is set,
an interactive shell associates a \fIjob\fP with each pipeline\&.
It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the \fBjobs\fP
command, and assigns them small integer numbers\&.
When a job is started asynchronously with `\fB&\fP\&',
the shell prints a line to standard error which looks like:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[1] 1234\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top\-level) process, whose process ID was 1234\&.
.PP
If a job is started with `\fB&|\fP\&' or `\fB&!\fP',
then that job is immediately disowned\&.  After startup, it
does not have a place in the job table, and is not subject
to the job control features described here\&.
.PP
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key
^Z (control\-Z) which sends a \fBTSTP\fP signal to the current job:  this key
may be redefined by the \fBsusp\fP option of the external \fBstty\fP command\&.
The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `suspended\&',
and print another prompt\&.  You can then manipulate the state of this job,
putting it in the background with the \fBbg\fP command, or run some other
commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with
the foreground command \fBfg\fP\&.  A ^Z takes effect immediately and
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded
when it is typed\&.
.PP
A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read
from the terminal\&.
.PP
Note that if the job running in the foreground is a shell function,
then suspending it will have the effect of causing the shell to fork\&.
This is necessary to separate the function\&'s state from that of the
parent shell performing the job control, so that the latter can return
to the command line prompt\&.  As a result, even if \fBfg\fP is
used to continue the job the function will no longer be part of the
parent shell, and any variables set by the function will not be visible
in the parent shell\&.  Thus the behaviour is different from the case
where the function was never suspended\&.  Zsh is different from many
other shells in this regard\&.
.PP
The same behaviour is found when the shell is executing code as the
right hand side of a pipeline or any complex shell construct such as
\fBif\fP, \fBfor\fP, etc\&., in order that the entire block of code
can be managed as a single job\&.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command `\fBstty tostop\fP\&'\&.
If you set this
tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce
output like they do when they try to read input\&.
.PP
When a command is suspended and continued later with the \fBfg\fP or
\fBwait\fP builtins, zsh restores tty modes that were in effect when it was
suspended\&.  This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is
continued via `\fBkill \-CONT\fP\&', nor when it is continued with \fBbg\fP\&.
.PP
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell\&.
A job can be referred to by the process ID of any process of the job
or by one of the following:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fB%\fP\fInumber\fP
The job with the given number\&.
.TP
\fB%\fP\fIstring\fP
Any job whose command line begins with \fIstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fB%?\fP\fIstring\fP
Any job whose command line contains \fIstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fB%%\fP
Current job\&.
.TP
\fB%+\fP
Equivalent to `\fB%%\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fB%\-\fP
Previous job\&.
.PD
.PP
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state\&.
It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
no further progress is possible\&.  If the \fBNOTIFY\fP option is not set,
it waits until just before it prints a prompt before it informs you\&.
All such notifications are sent directly to the terminal, not to
the standard output or standard error\&.
.PP
When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes
triggers any trap set for \fBCHLD\fP\&.
.PP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you will
be warned that `You have suspended (running) jobs\&'\&.
You may use the \fBjobs\fP command to see what they are\&.
If you do this or immediately try to
exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended
jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent
a \fBSIGHUP\fP signal, if the \fBHUP\fP option is set\&.
.PP
To avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs, either
use the \fBnohup\fP command (see \fInohup\fP(1))
or the \fBdisown\fP builtin\&.
.SH "SIGNALS"
The \fBINT\fP and \fBQUIT\fP signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
`\fB&\fP\&' and the \fBMONITOR\fP option is not active\&.
The shell itself always ignores the \fBQUIT\fP signal\&.
Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent
(but see the \fBTRAP\fP\fINAL\fP special functions in the section `Functions\&')\&.
.PP
Certain jobs are run asynchronously by the shell other than those
explicitly put into the background; even in cases where the shell
would usually wait for such jobs, an explicit \fBexit\fP command
or exit due to the option \fBERR_EXIT\fP will cause the shell to
exit without waiting\&.  Examples of such asynchronous jobs are
process substitution, see
the section PROCESS SUBSTITUTION in the \fIzshexpn\fP(1) manual page, and the handler processes for
multios, see
the section MULTIOS in the \fIzshmisc\fP(1) manual page\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/arith.yo
.SH "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION"
The shell can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either using
the builtin \fBlet\fP, or via a substitution of the form
\fB$((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&.  For
integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8\-byte precision where this
is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes\&.  This can be tested, for
example, by giving the command `\fBprint \- $(( 12345678901 ))\fP\&'; if the
number appears unchanged, the precision is at least 8 bytes\&.  Floating
point arithmetic always uses the `double\&' type with whatever corresponding
precision is provided by the compiler and the library\&.
.PP
The \fBlet\fP builtin command takes arithmetic expressions as arguments; each
is evaluated separately\&.  Since many of the arithmetic operators, as well
as spaces, require quoting, an alternative form is provided: for any
command which begins with a `\fB((\fP\&', all the characters until a
matching `\fB))\fP\&' are treated as a quoted expression and
arithmetic expansion performed as for an argument of \fBlet\fP\&.  More
precisely, `\fB((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&' is equivalent to
`\fBlet "\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB"\fP\&'\&.  The return status is 0 if the arithmetic value
of the expression is non\-zero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred\&.
.PP
For example, the following statement
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB(( val = 2 + 1 ))\fP

Integers can be in bases other than 10\&.
A leading `\fB0x\fP\&' or `\fB0X\fP' denotes hexadecimal and a leading
`\fB0b\fP\&' or `\fB0B\fP' binary\&.
Integers may also be of the form `\fIbase\fP\fB#\fP\fIn\fP\&',
where \fIbase\fP is a decimal number between two and thirty\-six
representing the arithmetic base and \fIn\fP
is a number in that base (for example, `\fB16#ff\fP\&' is 255 in hexadecimal)\&.
The \fIbase\fP\fB#\fP may also be omitted, in which case
base 10 is used\&.  For backwards compatibility the form
`\fB[\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\fIn\fP\&' is also accepted\&.
.PP
An integer expression or a base given in the form
`\fIbase\fP\fB#\fP\fIn\fP\&' may contain underscores (`\fB_\fP') after the
leading digit for visual guidance; these are ignored in computation\&.
Examples are \fB1_000_000\fP or \fB0xffff_ffff\fP which are equivalent to
\fB1000000\fP and \fB0xffffffff\fP respectively\&.
.PP
It is also possible to specify a base to be used for output in the form
`\fB[#\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\&', for example `\fB[#16]\fP'\&.  This is used when
outputting arithmetical substitutions or when assigning to scalar
parameters, but an explicitly defined integer or floating point parameter
will not be affected\&.  If an integer variable is implicitly defined by an
arithmetic expression, any base specified in this way will be set as the
variable\&'s output arithmetic base as if the option `\fB\-i\fP \fIbase\fP' to
the \fBtypeset\fP builtin had been used\&.  The expression has no precedence
and if it occurs more than once in a mathematical expression, the last
encountered is used\&.  For clarity it is recommended that it appear at the
beginning of an expression\&.  As an example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-i 16 y
print $(( [#8] x = 32, y = 32 ))
print $x $y\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs first `\fB8#40\fP\&', the rightmost value in the given output base, and
then `\fB8#40 16#20\fP\&', because \fBy\fP has been explicitly declared to
have output base 16, while \fBx\fP (assuming it does not already exist) is
implicitly typed by the arithmetic evaluation, where it acquires the output
base 8\&.
.PP
The \fIbase\fP may be replaced or followed by an underscore, which may
itself be followed by a positive integer (if it is missing the value 3
is used)\&.  This indicates that underscores should be inserted into the
output string, grouping the number for visual clarity\&.  The following
integer specifies the number of digits to group together\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsetopt cbases
print $(( [#16_4] 65536 ** 2 ))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs `\fB0x1_0000_0000\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The feature can be used with floating
point numbers, in which case the base must be omitted; grouping
is away from the decimal point\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzmodload zsh/mathfunc
print $(( [#_] sqrt(1e7) ))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs `\fB3_162\&.277_660_168_379_5\fP\&' (the number of decimal places
shown may vary)\&.
.PP
If the \fBC_BASES\fP option is set, hexadecimal numbers are output in the standard C
format, for example `\fB0xFF\fP\&' instead of the usual `\fB16#FF\fP'\&.  If the
option \fBOCTAL_ZEROES\fP is also set (it is not by default), octal numbers
will be treated similarly and hence appear as `\fB077\fP\&' instead of
`\fB8#77\fP\&'\&.  This option has no effect on the output of bases other than
hexadecimal and octal, and these formats are always understood on input\&.
.PP
When an output base is specified using the `\fB[#\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\&' syntax,
an appropriate base prefix will be output if necessary, so that the value
output is valid syntax for input\&.  If the \fB#\fP is doubled, for example
`\fB[##16]\fP\&', then no base prefix is output\&.
.PP
Floating point constants are recognized by the presence of a decimal point
or an exponent\&.  The decimal point may be the first character of the
constant, but the exponent character \fBe\fP or \fBE\fP may not, as it will be
taken for a parameter name\&.  All numeric parts (before and after the
decimal point and in the exponent) may contain underscores after the
leading digit for visual guidance; these are ignored in computation\&.

The operators `\fB&&\fP\&', `\fB||\fP', `\fB&&=\fP', and `\fB||=\fP' are
short\-circuiting, and only one of the latter two expressions in a ternary
operator is evaluated\&.  Note the precedence of the bitwise AND, OR,
and XOR operators\&.
.PP
With the option \fBC_PRECEDENCES\fP the precedences (but no other
properties) of the operators are altered to be the same as those in
most other languages that support the relevant operators:

Note the precedence of exponentiation in both cases is below
that of unary operators, hence `\fB\-3**2\fP\&' evaluates as `\fB9\fP', not
`\fB\-9\fP\&'\&.  Use parentheses where necessary: `\fB\-(3**2)\fP'\&.  This is
for compatibility with other shells\&.
.PP
Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax
`\fIfunc\fP\fB(\fP\fIargs\fP\fB)\fP\&', where the function decides
if the \fIargs\fP is used as a string or a comma\-separated list of
arithmetic expressions\&. The shell currently defines no mathematical
functions by default, but the module \fBzsh/mathfunc\fP may be loaded with
the \fBzmodload\fP builtin to provide standard floating point mathematical
functions\&.
.PP
An expression of the form `\fB##\fP\fIx\fP\&' where \fIx\fP is any character
sequence such as `\fBa\fP\&', `\fB^A\fP', or `\fB\eM\-\eC\-x\fP' gives the value of
this character and an expression of the form `\fB#\fP\fIname\fP\&' gives the
value of the first character of the contents of the parameter \fIname\fP\&.
Character values are according to the character set used in the current
locale; for multibyte character handling the option \fBMULTIBYTE\fP must be
set\&.  Note that this form is different from `\fB$#\fP\fIname\fP\&', a standard
parameter substitution which gives the length of the parameter \fIname\fP\&.
`\fB#\e\fP\&' is accepted instead of `\fB##\fP', but its use is deprecated\&.
.PP
Named parameters and subscripted arrays can be referenced by name within an
arithmetic expression without using the parameter expansion syntax\&.  For
example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB((val2 = val1 * 2))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
assigns twice the value of \fB$val1\fP to the parameter named \fBval2\fP\&.
.PP
An internal integer representation of a named parameter
can be specified with the \fBinteger\fP builtin\&.
Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each
assignment to a named parameter declared integer
in this manner\&.  Assigning a floating point number to an integer results in
rounding down to the next integer\&.
.PP
Likewise, floating point numbers can be declared with the \fBfloat\fP
builtin; there are two types, differing only in their output format, as
described for the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.  The output format can be bypassed
by using arithmetic substitution instead of the parameter substitution,
i\&.e\&. `\fB${\fP\fIfloat\fP\fB}\fP\&' uses the defined format, but
`\fB$((\fP\fIfloat\fP\fB))\fP\&' uses a generic floating point
format\&.
.PP
Promotion of integer to floating point values is performed where
necessary\&.  In addition, if any operator which requires an integer
(`\fB~\fP\&', `\fB&\fP', `\fB|\fP', `\fB^\fP', `\fB%\fP', `\fB<<\fP', `\fB>>\fP' and their
equivalents with assignment) is given a floating point argument, it will be
silently rounded down to the next integer\&.
.PP
Users should beware that, in common with many other programming
languages but not software designed for calculation, the evaluation of
an expression in zsh is taken a term at a time and promotion of integers
to floating point does not occur in terms only containing integers\&.  A
typical result of this is that a division such as \fB6/8\fP is truncated,
in this being rounded down to 0\&.  The \fBFORCE_FLOAT\fP shell option can
be used in scripts or functions where floating point evaluation is
required throughout\&.
.PP
Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point values at different
times; there is no memory of the numeric type in this case\&.
.PP
If a variable is first assigned in a numeric context without previously
being declared, it will be implicitly typed as \fBinteger\fP or \fBfloat\fP and
retain that type either until the type is explicitly changed or until the
end of the scope\&.  This can have unforeseen consequences\&.  For example, in
the loop
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor (( f = 0; f < 1; f += 0\&.1 )); do
# use $f
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
if \fBf\fP has not already been declared, the first assignment will cause it
to be created as an integer, and consequently the operation `\fBf += 0\&.1\fP\&'
will always cause the result to be truncated to zero, so that the loop will
fail\&.  A simple fix would be to turn the initialization into `\fBf = 0\&.0\fP\&'\&.
It is therefore best to declare numeric variables with explicit types\&.

For compatibility, if there is a single argument that is not
syntactically significant, typically a variable, the condition is
treated as a test for whether the expression expands as a string of
non\-zero length\&.  In other words, \fB[[ $var ]]\fP is the same as \fB[[ \-n
$var ]]\fP\&.  It is recommended that the second, explicit, form be used
where possible\&.
.PP
Normal shell expansion is performed on the \fIfile\fP, \fIstring\fP and
\fIpattern\fP arguments, but the result of each expansion is constrained to
be a single word, similar to the effect of double quotes\&.
.PP
Filename generation is not performed on any form of argument to
conditions\&.  However, it can be forced in any case where normal shell
expansion is valid and when the option \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP is in effect by
using an explicit glob qualifier of the form \fB(#q)\fP at the
end of the string\&.  A normal glob qualifier expression may appear
between the `\fBq\fP\&' and the closing parenthesis; if none appears the
expression has no effect beyond causing filename generation\&.  The
results of filename generation are joined together to form a single
word, as with the results of other forms of expansion\&.
.PP
This special use of filename generation is only available with the
\fB[[\fP syntax\&.  If the condition occurs within the \fB[\fP or \fBtest\fP
builtin commands then globbing occurs instead as part of normal command
line expansion before the condition is evaluated\&.  In this case it may
generate multiple words which are likely to confuse the syntax of the
test command\&.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ \-n file*(#qN) ]]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
produces status zero if and only if there is at least one file in the
current directory beginning with the string `\fBfile\fP\&'\&.  The globbing
qualifier \fBN\fP ensures that the expression is empty if there is
no matching file\&.
.PP
Pattern metacharacters are active for the \fIpattern\fP arguments;
the patterns are the same as those used for filename generation, see
\fIzshexpn\fP(1), but there is no special behaviour
of `\fB/\fP\&' nor initial dots, and no glob qualifiers are allowed\&.
.PP
In each of the above expressions, if
\fIfile\fP is of the form `\fB/dev/fd/\fP\fIn\fP\&',
where \fIn\fP is an integer,
then the test applied to the open file whose
descriptor number is \fIn\fP,
even if the underlying system does not support
the \fB/dev/fd\fP directory\&.
.PP
In the forms which do numeric comparison, the expressions \fIexp\fP
undergo arithmetic expansion as if they were enclosed in
\fB$((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&.
.PP
For example, the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ ( \-f foo || \-f bar ) && $report = y* ]] && print File exists\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
tests if either file \fBfoo\fP or file \fBbar\fP exists, and if so, if the
value of the parameter \fBreport\fP begins with `\fBy\fP\&'; if the complete
condition is true, the message `\fBFile exists\&.\fP\&' is printed\&.

Prompt sequences undergo a special form of expansion\&.  This type of expansion

\fIparameter expansion\fP,

If the \fBPROMPT_PERCENT\fP option is set, certain escape sequences that
start with `\fB%\fP\&' are expanded\&.

Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string\&.
The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to `\fB%\fP\fIxstringx\fP\&',
i\&.e\&. \fIx\fP may be `\fB<\fP\&' or `\fB>\fP'\&.

undergo prompt expansion\&.
.RS
.PP
The numeric argument, which in the third form may appear immediately
after the `\fB[\fP\&', specifies the maximum permitted length of
the various strings that can be displayed in the prompt\&.
In the first two forms, this numeric argument may be negative, in which
case the truncation length is determined by subtracting the absolute
value of the numeric argument from the number of character positions
remaining on the current prompt line\&.  If this results in a zero or
negative length, a length of 1 is used\&.  In other words, a negative
argument arranges that after truncation at least \fIn\fP characters
remain before the right margin (left margin for \fBRPROMPT\fP)\&.
.PP
The forms with `\fB<\fP\&' truncate at the left of the string,
and the forms with `\fB>\fP\&' truncate at the right of the string\&.
For example, if the current directory is `\fB/home/pike\fP\&',
the prompt `\fB%8<\&.\&.<%/\fP\&' will expand to `\fB\&.\&.e/pike\fP'\&.
In this string, the terminating character (`\fB<\fP\&', `\fB>\fP' or `\fB]\fP'),
or in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding `\fB\e\fP\&'; note
when using \fBprint \-P\fP, however, that this must be doubled as the
string is also subject to standard \fBprint\fP processing, in addition
to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string:  the worst case
is therefore `\fBprint \-P "%<\e\e\e\e<<\&.\&.\&."\fP\&'\&.
.PP
If the \fIstring\fP is longer than the specified truncation length,
it will appear in full, completely replacing the truncated string\&.
.PP
The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the
string, or to the end of the next enclosing group of the `\fB%(\fP\&'
construct, or to the next truncation encountered at the same grouping
level (i\&.e\&. truncations inside a `\fB%(\fP\&' are separate), which
ever comes first\&.  In particular, a truncation with argument zero
(e\&.g\&., `\fB%<<\fP\&') marks the end of the range of the string to be
truncated while turning off truncation from there on\&. For example, the
prompt `\fB%10<\&.\&.\&.<%~%<<%# \fP\&' will print a truncated representation of the
current directory, followed by a `\fB%\fP\&' or `\fB#\fP', followed by a
space\&.  Without the `\fB%<<\fP\&', those two characters would be included
in the string to be truncated\&.  Note that `\fB%\-0<<\fP\&' is not equivalent
to `\fB%<<\fP\&' but specifies that the prompt is truncated at the right margin\&.
.PP
Truncation applies only within each individual line of the prompt, as
delimited by embedded newlines (if any)\&.  If the total length of any line
of the prompt after truncation is greater than the terminal width, or if
the part to be truncated contains embedded newlines, truncation behavior
is undefined and may change in a future version of the shell\&.  Use
`\fB%\-\fP\fIn\fP\fB(l\&.\fP\fItrue\-text\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIfalse\-text\fP\fB)\fP\&' to remove parts
of the prompt when the available space is less than \fIn\fP\&.

Apart from these strings, the \fIname\fP may also be an asterisk
(`\fB*\fP\&') followed by any string\&. The \fIvalue\fP given for such a
string will be used for all files whose name ends with the string\&.
The \fIname\fP may also be an equals sign (`\fB=\fP\&') followed by a
pattern; the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option will be turned on for evaluation
of the pattern\&.  The \fIvalue\fP given for this pattern will be used for all
matches (not just filenames) whose display string are matched by
the pattern\&.  Definitions for the form with the leading equal sign take
precedence over the values defined for file types, which in turn take
precedence over the form with the leading asterisk (file extensions)\&.
.PP
The leading\-equals form also allows different parts of the displayed
strings to be colored differently\&.  For this, the pattern has to use the
`\fB(#b)\fP\&' globbing flag and pairs of parentheses surrounding the
parts of the strings that are to be colored differently\&.  In this case 
the \fIvalue\fP may consist of more than one color code separated by
equal signs\&.  The first code will be used for all parts for which no
explicit code is specified and the following codes will be used for
the parts matched by the sub\-patterns in parentheses\&.  For example,
the specification `\fB=(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7\fP\&' will be used for all
matches which are at least two characters long and will use
the code `\fB3\fP\&' for the first character, `\fB7\fP' for the last
character and `\fB0\fP\&' for the rest\&.
.PP
All three forms of \fIname\fP may be preceded by a pattern in
parentheses\&.  If this is given, the \fIvalue\fP will be used
only for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern
given in the parentheses\&.  For example, `\fB(g*)m*=43\fP\&' highlights all
matches beginning with `\fBm\fP\&' in groups whose names  begin with
`\fBg\fP\&' using the color code `\fB43\fP'\&.  In case of the `\fBlc\fP',
`\fBrc\fP\&', and `\fBec\fP' codes, the group pattern is ignored\&.
.PP
Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in which they
appear in the parameter value until the first one matches which is
then used\&.
.PP
When printing a match, the code prints the value of \fBlc\fP, the value
for the file\-type or the last matching specification with a `\fB*\fP\&',
the value of \fBrc\fP, the string to display for the match itself, and
then the value of \fBec\fP if that is defined or the values of \fBlc\fP,
\fBno\fP, and \fBrc\fP if \fBec\fP is not defined\&.
.PP
The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can be used on
vt100 compatible terminals such as \fBxterm\fPs\&.  On monochrome terminals
the default values will have no visible effect\&.  The \fBcolors\fP
function from the contribution can be used to get associative arrays
containing the codes for ANSI terminals (see
the section `Other Functions\&' in \fIzshcontrib\fP(1))\&.  For example, after loading \fBcolors\fP, one could use
`\fB$colors[red]\fP\&' to get the code for foreground color red and
`\fB$colors[bg\-green]\fP\&' for the code for background color green\&.
.PP
If the completion system invoked by compinit is used, these
parameters should not be set directly because the system controls them 
itself\&.  Instead, the \fBlist\-colors\fP style should be used (see
the section `Completion System Configuration\&' in \fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.
.PP
.SS "Scrolling in completion listings"
To enable scrolling through a completion list, the \fBLISTPROMPT\fP
parameter must be set\&.  Its value will be used as the prompt; if it
is the empty string, a default prompt will be used\&.  The value may
contain escapes of the form `\fB%x\fP\&'\&.  It supports the escapes
`\fB%B\fP\&', `\fB%b\fP', `\fB%S\fP', `\fB%s\fP', `\fB%U\fP', `\fB%u\fP', `\fB%F\fP',
`\fB%f\fP\&', `\fB%K\fP', `\fB%k\fP' and
`\fB%{\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB%}\fP\&' used also in shell prompts as well as three pairs of
additional sequences: a `\fB%l\fP\&' or `\fB%L\fP' is replaced by the number
of the last line shown and the total number of lines in the form
`\fInumber\fP\fB/\fP\fItotal\fP\&'; a `\fB%m\fP' or `\fB%M\fP' is replaced with
the number of the last match shown and the total number of matches; and 
`\fB%p\fP\&' or `\fB%P\fP' is replaced with `\fBTop\fP', `\fBBottom\fP' or the
position of the first line shown in percent of the total number of
lines, respectively\&.  In each of these cases the form with the uppercase
letter will be replaced with a string of fixed width, padded to the
right with spaces, while the lowercase form will not be padded\&.
.PP
If the parameter \fBLISTPROMPT\fP is set, the completion code will not ask if
the list should be shown\&.  Instead it immediately starts displaying the
list, stopping after the first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom,
waiting for a keypress after temporarily switching to the \fBlistscroll\fP
keymap\&.  Some of the zle functions have a special meaning while scrolling
lists:
.PP

.TP
\fBaccept\-search\fP

.PP
Every other character stops listing and immediately processes the key
as usual\&.  Any key that is not bound in the \fBlistscroll\fP keymap or
that is bound to \fBundefined\-key\fP is looked up in the keymap
currently selected\&.
.PP
As for the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters,
\fBLISTPROMPT\fP should not be set directly when using the shell
function based completion system\&.  Instead, the \fBlist\-prompt\fP style
should be used\&.
.PP
.SS "Menu selection"
The \fBzsh/complist\fP module also offers an alternative style of selecting
matches from a list, called menu selection, which can be used if the
shell is set up to return to the last prompt after showing a
completion list (see the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option in
\fIzshoptions\fP(1))\&.
.PP
Menu selection can be invoked directly by
the widget \fBmenu\-select\fP defined by this module\&.  This is a standard
ZLE widget that can be bound to a key in the usual way as described
in \fIzshzle\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Alternatively,
the parameter \fBMENUSELECT\fP can be set to an integer, which gives the
minimum number of matches that must be present before menu selection is
automatically turned on\&.  This second method requires that menu completion
be started, either directly from a widget such as \fBmenu\-complete\fP, or due
to one of the options \fBMENU_COMPLETE\fP or \fBAUTO_MENU\fP being set\&.  If
\fBMENUSELECT\fP is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection will always be
started during an ambiguous menu completion\&.
.PP
When using the completion system based on shell functions, the
\fBMENUSELECT\fP parameter should not be used (like the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP
and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters described above)\&.  Instead, the \fBmenu\fP 
style should be used with the \fBselect=\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP keyword\&.
.PP
After menu selection is started, the matches will be listed\&. If there
are more matches than fit on the screen, only the first screenful is
shown\&.  The
matches to insert into the command line can be selected from this
list\&.  In the list one match is highlighted using the value for \fBma\fP
from the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP or \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameter\&.  The default
value for this is `\fB7\fP\&' which forces the selected match to be
highlighted using standout mode on a vt100\-compatible terminal\&.  If
neither \fBZLS_COLORS\fP nor \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP is set, the same terminal
control sequence as for the `\fB%S\fP\&' escape in prompts is used\&.
.PP
If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the parameter
\fBMENUPROMPT\fP is set, its value will be shown below the matches\&.  It
supports the same escape sequences as \fBLISTPROMPT\fP, but the number
of the match or line shown will be that of the one where the mark is
placed\&.  If its value is the empty string, a default prompt will be
used\&.
.PP
The \fBMENUSCROLL\fP parameter can be used to specify how the list is
scrolled\&.  If the parameter is unset, this is done line by line, if it
is set to `\fB0\fP\&' (zero), the list will scroll half the number of
lines of the screen\&.  If the value is positive, it gives the number of
lines to scroll and if it is negative, the list will be scrolled
the number of lines of the screen minus the (absolute) value\&.
.PP
As for the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP, \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP and \fBLISTPROMPT\fP
parameters, neither \fBMENUPROMPT\fP nor \fBMENUSCROLL\fP should be
set directly when using the shell function based completion
system\&.  Instead, the \fBselect\-prompt\fP and \fBselect\-scroll\fP styles
should be used\&.
.PP
The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of the matches
in the list\&.  These hidden matches are either matches for which the
completion function which added them explicitly requested that they
not appear in the list (using the \fB\-n\fP option of the \fBcompadd\fP
builtin command) or they are matches which duplicate a string already
in the list (because they differ only in things like prefixes or
suffixes that are not displayed)\&.  In the list used for menu selection,
however, even these matches are shown so that it is possible to select
them\&.  To highlight such matches the \fBhi\fP and \fBdu\fP capabilities in
the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters are supported for
hidden matches of the first and second kind, respectively\&.
.PP
Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around using the zle movement
functions\&.  When not all matches can be shown on the screen at the same 
time, the list will scroll up and down when crossing the top or
bottom line\&.  The following zle functions have special meaning during
menu selection\&.  Note that the following always
perform the same task within the menu selection map and cannot be
replaced by user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions
be extended:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP

\fBaccept\-line\fP, \fBaccept\-search\fP

menu selection again;  in the case of files this allows one to select
a directory and immediately attempt to complete files in it;  if there 
are no matches, a message is shown and one can use \fBundo\fP to go back 
to completion on the previous level, every other key leaves menu
selection (including the other zle functions which are otherwise

.PP
All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any other zle function not
listed leaves menu selection and executes that function\&.  It is possible to
make widgets in the above list do the same by using the form of the widget
with a `\fB\&.\fP\&' in front\&.  For example, the widget `\fB\&.accept\-line\fP' has
the effect of leaving menu selection and accepting the entire command line\&.
.PP
During this selection the widget uses the keymap \fBmenuselect\fP\&.  Any
key that is not defined in this keymap or that is bound to
\fBundefined\-key\fP is looked up in the keymap currently selected\&.  This
is used to ensure that the most important keys used during selection
(namely the cursor keys, return, and TAB) have sensible defaults\&.  However,
keys in the \fBmenuselect\fP keymap can be modified directly using the
\fBbindkey\fP builtin command (see
\fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&. For example, to make the return key leave menu selection without
accepting the match currently selected one could call

.SH "THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_computil.yo

The \fBzsh/computil\fP module adds several builtin commands that are used by
some of the completion functions in the completion system based on shell
functions (see 
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1)
)\&.  Except for \fBcompquote\fP these builtin commands are very
specialised and thus not very interesting when writing your own
completion functions\&.  In summary, these builtin commands are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBcomparguments\fP
This is used by the \fB_arguments\fP function to do the argument and
command line parsing\&.  Like \fBcompdescribe\fP it has an option \fB\-i\fP to 
do the parsing and initialize some internal state and various options
to access the state information to decide what should be completed\&.
.TP
\fBcompdescribe\fP
This is used by the \fB_describe\fP function to build the displays for
the matches and to get the strings to add as matches with their
options\&.  On the first call one of the options \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-I\fP should be
supplied as the first argument\&.  In the first case, display strings without
the descriptions will be generated, in the second case, the string used to
separate the matches from their descriptions must be given as the
second argument and the descriptions (if any) will be shown\&.  All other 
arguments are like the definition arguments to \fB_describe\fP itself\&.
.RS
.PP
Once \fBcompdescribe\fP has been called with either the \fB\-i\fP or the
\fB\-I\fP option, it can be repeatedly called with the \fB\-g\fP option and
the names of four parameters as its arguments\&.  This will step through
the different sets of matches and store the value of \fBcompstate[list]\fP
in the first scalar, the options for \fBcompadd\fP in the second array,
the matches in the third array, and the strings to be displayed in the
completion listing in the fourth array\&.  The arrays may then be directly
given to \fBcompadd\fP to register the matches with the completion code\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcompfiles\fP
Used by the \fB_path_files\fP function to optimize complex recursive
filename generation (globbing)\&.  It does three things\&.  With the
\fB\-p\fP and \fB\-P\fP options it builds the glob patterns to use,
including the paths already handled and trying to optimize the
patterns with respect to the prefix and suffix from the line and the
match specification currently used\&.  The \fB\-i\fP option does the
directory tests for the \fBignore\-parents\fP style and the \fB\-r\fP option 
tests if a component for some of the matches are equal to the string
on the line and removes all other matches if that is true\&.
.TP
\fBcompgroups\fP
Used by the \fB_tags\fP function to implement the internals of the
\fBgroup\-order\fP style\&.  This only takes its arguments as names of
completion groups and creates the groups for it (all six types: sorted 
and unsorted, both without removing duplicates, with removing all
duplicates and with removing consecutive duplicates)\&.
.TP
\fBcompquote\fP [ \fB\-p\fP ] \fInames\fP \&.\&.\&.
There may be reasons to write completion functions that have to add
the matches using the \fB\-Q\fP option to \fBcompadd\fP and perform quoting
themselves\&.  Instead of interpreting the first character of the
\fBall_quotes\fP key of the \fBcompstate\fP special association and using
the \fBq\fP flag for parameter expansions, one can use this builtin
command\&.  The arguments are the names of scalar or array parameters
and the values of these parameters are quoted as needed for the
innermost quoting level\&.  If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, quoting is
done as if there is some prefix before the values of the parameters,
so that a leading equal sign will not be quoted\&.
.RS
.PP
The return status is non\-zero in case of an error and zero otherwise\&.
.RE
.TP
.PD 0
\fBcomptags\fP
.TP

\fBcomptry\fP

`\fBzcurses end\fP\&' to end it; omitting `\fBzcurses end\fP' can cause
the terminal to be in an unwanted state\&.
.RS
.PP
The subcommand \fBaddwin\fP creates a window with \fInlines\fP lines and
\fIncols\fP columns\&.  Its upper left corner will be placed at row
\fIbegin_y\fP and column
\fIbegin_x\fP of the screen\&.  \fItargetwin\fP is a string and refers
to the name of a window that is not currently assigned\&.  Note
in particular the curses convention that vertical values appear
before horizontal values\&.
.PP
If \fBaddwin\fP is given an existing window as the final argument, the new
window is created as a subwindow of \fIparentwin\fP\&.  This differs from an
ordinary new window in that the memory of the window contents is shared
with the parent\&'s memory\&.  Subwindows must be deleted before their parent\&.
Note that the coordinates of subwindows are relative to the screen, not
the parent, as with other windows\&.
.PP
Use the subcommand \fBdelwin\fP to delete a window created with
\fBaddwin\fP\&.  Note that \fBend\fP does \fInot\fP implicitly delete windows,
and that \fBdelwin\fP does not erase the screen image of the window\&.
.PP
The window corresponding to the full visible screen is called
\fBstdscr\fP; it always exists after `\fBzcurses init\fP\&' and cannot
be delete with \fBdelwin\fP\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBrefresh\fP will refresh window \fItargetwin\fP; this is
necessary to make any pending changes (such as characters you have
prepared for output with \fBchar\fP) visible on the screen\&.  \fBrefresh\fP
without an argument causes the screen to be cleared and redrawn\&.
If multiple windows are given, the screen is updated once at the end\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBtouch\fP marks the \fItargetwin\fPs listed as changed\&.
This is necessary before \fBrefresh\fPing windows if a window that
was in front of another window (which may be \fBstdscr\fP) is deleted\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBmove\fP moves the cursor position in \fItargetwin\fP to
new coordinates \fInew_y\fP and \fInew_x\fP\&.  Note that the 
subcommand \fBstring\fP (but not the subcommand \fBchar\fP) advances the
cursor position over the characters added\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBclear\fP erases the contents of \fItargetwin\fP\&.  One
(and no more than one) of three options may be specified\&.  With the
option \fBredraw\fP, in addition the next \fBrefresh\fP of \fItargetwin\fP
will cause the screen to be cleared and repainted\&.  With the option
\fBeol\fP, \fItargetwin\fP is only cleared to the end of the current cursor
line\&.  With the option
\fBbot\fP, \fItargetwin\fP is cleared to the end of the window, i\&.e
everything to the right and below the cursor is cleared\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBposition\fP writes various positions associated with
\fItargetwin\fP into the array named \fIarray\fP\&.
These are, in order:
.PD 0
.TP
\-
The y and x coordinates of the cursor relative to the top left
of \fItargetwin\fP
.TP
\-
The y and x coordinates of the top left of \fItargetwin\fP on the
screen
.TP
\-
The size of \fItargetwin\fP in y and x dimensions\&.
.PD
.PP
Outputting characters and strings are achieved by \fBchar\fP and \fBstring\fP
respectively\&.
.PP
To draw a border around window \fItargetwin\fP, use \fBborder\fP\&.  Note
that the border is not subsequently handled specially:  in other words,
the border is simply a set of characters output at the edge of the
window\&.  Hence it can be overwritten, can scroll off the window, etc\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBattr\fP will set \fItargetwin\fP\&'s attributes or
foreground/background color pair for any successive character output\&.
Each \fIattribute\fP given on the line may be prepended by a \fB+\fP to set
or a \fB\-\fP to unset that attribute; \fB+\fP is assumed if absent\&.  The
attributes supported are \fBblink\fP, \fBbold\fP, \fBdim\fP, \fBreverse\fP,
\fBstandout\fP, and \fBunderline\fP\&.
.PP
Each \fIfg_col\fP\fB/\fP\fIbg_col\fP attribute (to be read as
`\fIfg_col\fP on \fIbg_col\fP\&') sets the foreground and background color
for character output\&.  The color \fBdefault\fP is sometimes available
(in particular if the library is ncurses), specifying the foreground
or background color with which the terminal started\&.  The color pair
\fBdefault/default\fP is always available\&.
.PP
\fBbg\fP overrides the color and other attributes of all characters in the
window\&.  Its usual use is to set the background initially, but it will
overwrite the attributes of any characters at the time when it is called\&.
In addition to the arguments allowed with \fBattr\fP, an argument \fB@\fP\fIchar\fP
specifies a character to be shown in otherwise blank areas of the window\&.
Owing to limitations of curses this cannot be a multibyte character
(use of ASCII characters only is recommended)\&.  As the specified set
of attributes override the existing background, turning attributes
off in the arguments is not useful, though this does not cause an error\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBscroll\fP can be used with \fBon\fP or \fBoff\fP to enabled
or disable scrolling of a window when the cursor would otherwise move
below the window due to typing or output\&.  It can also be used with a
positive or negative integer to scroll the window up or down the given
number of lines without changing the current cursor position (which
therefore appears to move in the opposite direction relative to the
window)\&.  In the second case, if scrolling is \fBoff\fP it is temporarily
turned \fBon\fP to allow the window to be scrolled\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBinput\fP reads a single character from the window
without echoing it back\&.  If \fIparam\fP is supplied the character is
assigned to the parameter \fIparam\fP, else it is assigned to the
parameter \fBREPLY\fP\&.
.PP
If both \fIparam\fP and \fIkparam\fP are supplied, the key is read in
`keypad\&' mode\&.  In this mode special keys such as function keys and
arrow keys return the name of the key in the parameter \fIkparam\fP\&.  The
key names are the macros defined in the \fBcurses\&.h\fP or \fBncurses\&.h\fP
with the prefix `\fBKEY_\fP\&' removed; see also the description of the
parameter \fBzcurses_keycodes\fP below\&.  Other keys cause a value to be
set in \fIparam\fP as before\&.  On a successful return only one of

There is no window argument; mouse options are global\&.
`\fBzcurses mouse\fP\&' with no arguments returns status 0 if mouse handling
is possible, else status 1\&.  Otherwise, the possible arguments (which
may be combined on the same command line) are as follows\&.
\fBdelay\fP \fInum\fP sets the maximum delay in milliseconds between press and
release events to be considered as a click; the value 0 disables click
resolution, and the default is one sixth of a second\&.  \fBmotion\fP proceeded
by an optional `\fB+\fP\&' (the default) or \fB\-\fP turns on or off
reporting of mouse motion in addition to clicks, presses and releases,
which are always reported\&.  However, it appears reports for mouse
motion are not currently implemented\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBtimeout\fP specifies a timeout value for input from
\fItargetwin\fP\&.  If \fIintval\fP is negative, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' waits
indefinitely for a character to be typed; this is the default\&.  If
\fIintval\fP is zero, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' returns immediately; if there
is typeahead it is returned, else no input is done and status 1 is
returned\&.  If \fIintval\fP is positive, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' waits
\fIintval\fP milliseconds for input and if there is none at the end of
that period returns status 1\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBquerychar\fP queries the character at the current cursor
position\&.  The return values are stored in the array named \fIparam\fP if
supplied, else in the array \fBreply\fP\&.  The first value is the character
(which may be a multibyte character if the system supports them); the
second is the color pair in the usual \fIfg_col\fP\fB/\fP\fIbg_col\fP

the whole contents of the file will always reside physically in memory when

operations)\&.  In particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files
(greater than the machine\&'s swap space, or than the range of the pointer
type) will be incorrect\&.

The following functions take two floating point arguments: \fBcopysign\fP,
\fBfmod\fP, \fBhypot\fP, \fBnextafter\fP\&.
.PP
The following take an integer first argument and a floating point second
argument: \fBjn\fP, \fByn\fP\&.
.PP
The following take a floating point first argument and an integer second
argument: \fBldexp\fP, \fBscalb\fP\&.
.PP
The function \fBabs\fP does not convert the type of its single argument; it
returns the absolute value of either a floating point number or an
integer\&.  The functions \fBfloat\fP and \fBint\fP convert their arguments into
a floating point or integer value (by truncation) respectively\&.
.PP
Note that the C \fBpow\fP function is available in ordinary math evaluation
as the `\fB**\fP\&' operator and is not provided here\&.
.PP
The function \fBrand48\fP is available if your system\&'s mathematical library
has the function \fBerand48(3)\fP\&.  It returns a pseudo\-random floating point
number between 0 and 1\&.  It takes a single string optional argument\&.
.PP
If the argument is not present, the random number seed is initialised by
three calls to the \fBrand(3)\fP function \-\-\- this produces the
same random
numbers as the next three values of \fB$RANDOM\fP\&.
.PP
If the argument is present, it gives the name of a scalar parameter where
the current random number seed will be stored\&.  On the first call, the
value must contain at least twelve hexadecimal digits (the remainder of the
string is ignored), or the seed will be initialised in the same manner as
for a call to \fBrand48\fP with no argument\&.  Subsequent calls to
\fBrand48\fP(\fIparam\fP) will then maintain the seed in the
parameter \fIparam\fP as a string of twelve hexadecimal digits, with no base
signifier\&.  The random number sequences for different parameters are
completely independent, and are also independent from that used by calls to
\fBrand48\fP with no argument\&.
.PP
For example, consider
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint $(( rand48(seed) ))
print $(( rand48() ))
print $(( rand48(seed) ))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Assuming \fB$seed\fP does not exist, it will be initialised by the first
call\&.  In the second call, the default seed is initialised; note, however,
that because of the properties of \fBrand()\fP there is a
correlation between
the seeds used for the two initialisations, so for more secure uses, you
should generate your own 12\-byte seed\&.  The third call returns to the same
sequence of random numbers used in the first call, unaffected by the
intervening \fBrand48()\fP\&.
.SH "THE ZSH/NEWUSER MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_newuser.yo

The \fBzsh/newuser\fP module is loaded at boot if it is
available, the \fBRCS\fP option is set, and the \fBPRIVILEGED\fP option is not
set (all three are true by default)\&.  This takes
place immediately after commands in the global \fBzshenv\fP file (typically
\fB/etc/zshenv\fP), if any, have been executed\&.  If the module is not
available it is silently ignored by the shell; the module may safely be
removed from \fB$MODULE_PATH\fP by the administrator if it is not required\&.
.PP
On loading, the module tests if any of the start\-up files \fB\&.zshenv\fP,
\fB\&.zprofile\fP, \fB\&.zshrc\fP or \fB\&.zlogin\fP exist in the directory given by
the environment variable \fBZDOTDIR\fP, or the user\&'s home directory if that
is not set\&.  The test is not performed and the module halts processing if
the shell was in an emulation mode (i\&.e\&. had been invoked as some other
shell than zsh)\&.
.PP
If none of the start\-up files were found, the module then looks for the
file \fBnewuser\fP first in a sitewide directory, usually the parent
directory of the \fBsite\-functions\fP directory, and if that is not found the
module searches in a version\-specific directory, usually the parent of the
\fBfunctions\fP directory containing version\-specific functions\&.  (These
directories can be configured when zsh is built using the
\fB\-\-enable\-site\-scriptdir=\fP\fIdir\fP and \fB\-\-enable\-scriptdir=\fP\fIdir\fP
flags to \fBconfigure\fP, respectively; the defaults are
\fIprefix\fP\fB/share/zsh\fP and \fIprefix\fP\fB/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION\fP where
the default \fIprefix\fP is \fB/usr/local\fP\&.)
.PP
If the file \fBnewuser\fP is found, it is then sourced in the same manner as
a start\-up file\&.  The file is expected to contain code to install start\-up
files for the user, however any valid shell code will be executed\&.
.PP
The \fBzsh/newuser\fP module is then unconditionally unloaded\&.
.PP
Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same effect as the
\fBzsh/newuser\fP module by adding code to \fB/etc/zshenv\fP\&.  The module
exists simply to allow the shell to make arrangements for new users without
the need for intervention by package maintainers and system administrators\&.
.PP
The script supplied with the module invokes the shell function
\fBzsh\-newuser\-install\fP\&.  This may be invoked directly by the user
even if the \fBzsh/newuser\fP module is disabled\&.  Note, however, that
if the module is not installed the function will not be installed either\&.
The function is documented in
the section User Configuration Functions in \fIzshcontrib\fP(1)\&.

Returns successfully if \fBstring\fP matches the previously\-compiled
PCRE\&.
.RS
.PP
Upon successful match,
if the expression captures substrings within parentheses,
\fBpcre_match\fP will set the array \fBmatch\fP to those
substrings, unless the \fB\-a\fP option is given, in which

\fBMATCH\fP will be set to the entire matched portion of the
string, unless the \fB\-v\fP option is given, in which case the variable
\fIvar\fP will be set\&.
No variables are altered if there is no successful match\&.
A \fB\-n\fP option starts searching for a match from the
byte \fIoffset\fP position in \fIstring\fP\&.  If the \fB\-b\fP option is given,
the variable \fBZPCRE_OP\fP will be set to an offset pair string,
representing the byte offset positions of the entire matched portion
within the \fIstring\fP\&.  For example, a \fBZPCRE_OP\fP set to "32 45" indicates
that the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on byte offset 44\&.
Here, byte offset position 45 is the position directly after the matched
portion\&.  Keep in mind that the byte position isn\&'t necessarily the same
as the character position when UTF\-8 characters are involved\&.
Consequently, the byte offset positions are only to be relied on in the
context of using them for subsequent searches on \fIstring\fP, using an offset
position as an argument to the \fB\-n\fP option\&.  This is mostly
used to implement the "find all non\-overlapping matches" functionality\&.

\fBzsystem flock \-u\fP \fIfd_expr\fP
The builtin \fBzsystem\fP\&'s subcommand \fBflock\fP performs advisory file
locking (via the \fIfcntl\fP(2) system call) over the entire contents
of the given file\&.  This form of locking requires the processes
accessing the file to cooperate; its most obvious use is between two
instances of the shell itself\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form the named \fIfile\fP, which must already exist, is
locked by opening a file descriptor to the file and applying a lock to
the file descriptor\&.  The lock terminates when the shell process that
created the lock exits; it is therefore often convenient to create file
locks within subshells, since the lock is automatically released when
the subshell exits\&.  Status 0 is returned if the lock succeeds, else
status 1\&.
.PP
In the second form the file descriptor given by the arithmetic
expression \fIfd_expr\fP is closed, releasing a lock\&.  The file descriptor
can be queried by using the `\fB\-f\fP \fIvar\fP\&' form during the lock;
on a successful lock, the shell variable \fIvar\fP is set to the file
descriptor used for locking\&.  The lock will be released if the
file descriptor is closed by any other means, for example using
`\fBexec {\fP\fIvar\fP\fB}>&\-\fP\&'; however, the form described here performs
a safety check that the file descriptor is in use for file locking\&.
.PP
By default the shell waits indefinitely for the lock to succeed\&.
The option \fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP specifies a timeout for the lock in
seconds; currently this must be an integer\&.  The shell will attempt
to lock the file once a second during this period\&.  If the attempt
times out, status 2 is returned\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-e\fP is given, the file descriptor for the lock is
preserved when the shell uses \fBexec\fP to start a new process;
otherwise it is closed at that point and the lock released\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-r\fP is given, the lock is only for reading, otherwise
it is for reading and writing\&.  The file descriptor is opened

Deleting sessions while a \fBzftp\fP command is active in the background can

This is because all shell subprocesses share information on the state of

block\&.  After a \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-e\fP, the given file descriptors are
to be tested for reading, writing, or error conditions\&.  These options and
an arbitrary list of file descriptors may be given in any order\&.
.PP
(The presence of an `error condition\&' is not well defined in the
documentation for many implementations of the select system call\&.
According to recent versions of the POSIX specification, it is really an
\fIexception\fP condition, of which the only standard example is out\-of\-band
data received on a socket\&.  So zsh users are unlikely to find the \fB\-e\fP
option useful\&.)
.PP
The option `\fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP\&' specifies a timeout in hundredths of a
second\&.  This may be zero, in which case the file descriptors will simply
be polled and \fBzselect\fP will return immediately\&.  It is possible to call
zselect with no file descriptors and a non\-zero timeout for use as a
finer\-grained replacement for `sleep\&'; note, however, the return status is
always 1 for a timeout\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-a\fP \fIarray\fP\&' indicates that \fIarray\fP should be set to
indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready\&.  If the option
is not
given, the array \fBreply\fP will be used for this purpose\&.  The array will
contain a string similar to the arguments for \fBzselect\fP\&.  For example,
.PP

might return immediately with status 0 and \fB$reply\fP containing `\fB\-r 0 \-w
1\fP\&' to show that both file descriptors are ready for the requested
operations\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-A\fP \fIassoc\fP\&' indicates that the associative array
\fIassoc\fP should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s)
which are ready\&.  This option overrides the option \fB\-a\fP, nor will
\fBreply\fP be modified\&.  The keys of \fBassoc\fP are the file descriptors, and
the corresponding values are any of the characters `\fBrwe\fP\&' to indicate
the condition\&.
.PP
The command returns status 0 if some file descriptors are ready for
reading\&.  If the operation timed out, or a timeout of 0 was given and no
file descriptors were ready, or there was an error, it returns status 1 and
the array will not be set (nor modified in any way)\&.  If there was an error
in the select operation the appropriate error message is printed\&.

This builtin command is used to define and lookup styles\&.  Styles are
pairs of names and values, where the values consist of any number of
strings\&.  They are stored together with patterns and lookup is done by
giving a string, called the `context\&', which is compared to the
patterns\&.  The definition stored for the first matching pattern will be 
returned\&.
.RS
.PP
For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from most specific to
least specific, and patterns that are equally specific keep the order in 
which they were defined\&.  A pattern is considered to be more specific
than another if it contains more components (substrings separated by
colons) or if the patterns for the components are more specific, where 
simple strings are considered to be more specific than patterns and
complex patterns are considered to be more specific than the pattern
`\fB*\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The first form (without arguments) lists the definitions\&.  Styles
are shown in alphabetic order and patterns are shown in the order
\fBzstyle\fP will test them\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-L\fP option is given, listing is done in the form of calls to
\fBzstyle\fP\&.  The optional first argument is a pattern which will be matched
against the string supplied as the pattern for the context; note that
this means, for example, `\fBzstyle \-L ":completion:*"\fP\&' will
match any supplied pattern beginning `\fB:completion:\fP\&', not
just \fB":completion:*"\fP:  use \fB":completion:\e*"\fP to match that\&.
The optional second argument limits the output to a specific \fIstyle\fP (not a
pattern)\&.  \fB\-L\fP is not compatible with any other options\&.

concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string will be
evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the \fBeval\fP builtin
command) when the style is looked up\&.  In this case the parameter
`\fBreply\fP\&' must be assigned to set the strings returned after the

it were not set\&.

\fBzformat \-a\fP \fIarray\fP \fIsep\fP \fIspec\fP \&.\&.\&.
This builtin provides two different forms of formatting\&. The first form 
is selected with the \fB\-f\fP option\&. In this case the \fIformat\fP
string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a percent 
sign in it with strings from the \fIspec\fPs\&.  Each \fIspec\fP should be
of the form `\fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstring\fP\&' which will cause every
appearance of the sequence `\fB%\fP\fIchar\fP\&' in \fIformat\fP to be replaced 
by the \fIstring\fP\&.  The `\fB%\fP\&' sequence may also contain optional
minimum and maximum field width specifications between the `\fB%\fP\&' and 
the `\fIchar\fP\&' in the form `\fB%\fP\fImin\fP\fB\&.\fP\fImax\fP\fBc\fP',
i\&.e\&. the minimum field width is given first and if the maximum field
width is used, it has to be preceded by a dot\&.  Specifying a minimum field
width makes the result be padded with spaces to the right if the
\fIstring\fP is shorter than the requested width\&.  Padding to the left
can be achieved by giving a negative minimum field width\&.  If a maximum 
field width is specified, the \fIstring\fP will be truncated after that
many characters\&.  After all `\fB%\fP\&' sequences for the given \fIspec\fPs
have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the parameter
\fIparam\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB%\fP\-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the form used by
prompts\&.  The \fB%\fP is followed by a `\fB(\fP\&' and then an ordinary
format specifier character as described above\&.  There may be a set of
digits either before or after the `\fB(\fP\&'; these specify a test
number, which defaults to zero\&.  Negative numbers are also allowed\&.  An
arbitrary delimiter character follows the format specifier, which is
followed by a piece of `true\&' text, the delimiter character again, a piece
of `false\&' text, and a closing parenthesis\&.  The complete expression
(without the digits) thus looks like
`\fB%(\fP\fIX\fP\fB\&.\fP\fItext1\fP\fB\&.\fP\fItext2\fP\fB)\fP\&', except that
the `\fB\&.\fP\&' character is arbitrary\&.  The value given for the format
specifier in the \fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstring\fP expressions is evaluated as a
mathematical expression, and compared with the test number\&.  If they are
the same, \fItext1\fP is output, else \fItext2\fP is output\&.  A parenthesis
may be escaped in \fItext2\fP as \fB%)\fP\&.  Either of \fItext1\fP or
\fItext2\fP may contain nested \fB%\fP\-escapes\&.

For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzformat \-f REPLY "The answer is \&'%3(c\&.yes\&.no)'\&." c:3\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs "The answer is \&'yes'\&." to \fBREPLY\fP since the value for the format
specifier \fBc\fP is 3, agreeing with the digit argument to the ternary
expression\&.
.PP
The second form, using the \fB\-a\fP option, can be used for aligning
strings\&.  Here, the \fIspec\fPs are of the form
`\fIleft\fP\fB:\fP\fIright\fP\&' where `\fIleft\fP' and `\fIright\fP' are
arbitrary strings\&.  These strings are modified by replacing the colons
by the \fIsep\fP string and padding the \fIleft\fP strings with spaces 
to the right so that the \fIsep\fP strings in the result (and hence the 
\fIright\fP strings after them) are all aligned if the strings are
printed below each other\&.  All strings without a colon are left
unchanged and all strings with an empty \fIright\fP string have the
trailing colon removed\&.  In both cases the lengths of the strings
are not used to determine how the other strings are to be aligned\&.
The resulting strings are stored in the \fIarray\fP\&.

This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in positional parameters,
i\&.e\&. the set of arguments given by \fB$*\fP\&.  Each \fIspec\fP describes one
option and must be of the form `\fIopt\fP[\fB=\fP\fIarray\fP]\&'\&.  If an option
described by \fIopt\fP is found in the positional parameters it is copied
into the \fIarray\fP specified with the \fB\-a\fP option; if the optional
`\fB=\fP\fIarray\fP\&' is given, it is instead copied into that array\&.

Note that it is an error to give any \fIspec\fP without an
`\fB=\fP\fIarray\fP\&' unless one of the \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-A\fP options is used\&.

Unless the \fB\-E\fP option is given, parsing stops at the first string
that isn\&'t described by one of the \fIspec\fPs\&.  Even with \fB\-E\fP,
parsing always stops at a positional parameter equal to `\fB\-\fP\&' or
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'\&.

With this option, the arrays specified with the \fB\-a\fP option and with the

\fIspec\fPs is used\&.  Individual elements of associative arrays specified

\fB\-M\fP
This changes the assignment rules to implement a map among equivalent
option names\&.  If any \fIspec\fP uses the `\fB=\fP\fIarray\fP\&' form, the

which is used to choose where to store the values\&.  If no other \fIspec\fP
is found, the values are stored as usual\&.  This changes only the way the
values are stored, not the way \fB$*\fP is parsed, so results may be
unpredictable if the `\fIname\fP\fB+\fP\&' specifier is used inconsistently\&.

.SH "SPECIFYING OPTIONS"
Options are primarily referred to by name\&.
These names are case insensitive and underscores are ignored\&.
For example, `\fBallexport\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fBA__lleXP_ort\fP'\&.
.PP
The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with
`\fBno\fP\&', so `\fBsetopt No_Beep\fP' is equivalent to `\fBunsetopt beep\fP'\&.
This inversion can only be done once, so `\fBnonobeep\fP\&' is \fInot\fP
a synonym for `\fBbeep\fP\&'\&.  Similarly, `\fBtify\fP' is not a synonym for
`\fBnonotify\fP\&' (the inversion of `\fBnotify\fP')\&.
.PP
Some options also have one or more single letter names\&.
There are two sets of single letter options: one used by default,
and another used to emulate \fBsh\fP/\fBksh\fP (used when the
\fBSH_OPTION_LETTERS\fP option is set)\&.
The single letter options can be used on the shell command line,
or with the \fBset\fP, \fBsetopt\fP and \fBunsetopt\fP
builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by `\fB\-\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using
`\fB+\fP\&' instead of `\fB\-\fP'\&.
Some of the single letter option names refer to an option being off,
in which case the inversion of that name refers to the option being on\&.
For example, `\fB+n\fP\&' is the short name of `\fBexec\fP', and
`\fB\-n\fP\&' is the short name of its inversion, `\fBnoexec\fP'\&.
.PP
In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,
trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `\fB\-f    \fP\&'
will be treated just as `\fB\-f\fP\&', but the string `\fB\-f i\fP' is an error\&.
This is because many systems which implement the `\fB#!\fP\&' mechanism for
calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace\&.

When changing to a directory containing a path segment `\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' which would

For example, suppose \fB/foo/bar\fP is a link to the directory \fB/alt/rod\fP\&.
Without this option set, `\fBcd /foo/bar/\&.\&.\fP\&' changes to \fB/foo\fP; with it

When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words

a `\fB*\fP\&' was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when
\fBCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\fP is set\&.  This actually uses pattern matching, not
globbing, so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as
options, user names, etc\&.

Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example,
case\-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used\&.  This limitation

This option works when \fBAUTO_LIST\fP or \fBBASH_AUTO_LIST\fP is also

\fBLIST_BEEP\fP <D>
Beep on an ambiguous completion\&.  More accurately, this forces the

\fBPOSIX_ARGZERO\fP
This option may be used to temporarily disable \fBFUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP and
thereby restore the value of \fB$0\fP to the name used to invoke the shell
(or as set by the \fB\-c\fP command line option)\&.  For compatibility with
previous versions of the shell, emulations use \fBNO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP
instead of \fBPOSIX_ARGZERO\fP, which may result in unexpected scoping of
\fB$0\fP if the emulation mode is changed inside a function or script\&.
To avoid this, explicitly enable \fBPOSIX_ARGZERO\fP in the \fBemulate\fP
command:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBemulate sh \-o POSIX_ARGZERO\fP

\fBPOSIX_BUILTINS\fP <K> <S>
When this option is set the \fBcommand\fP builtin can be used to execute
shell builtin commands\&.  Parameter assignments specified before shell
functions and special builtins are kept after the command completes unless
the special builtin is prefixed with the \fBcommand\fP builtin\&.  Special
builtins are
\fB\&.\fP,
\fB:\fP,
\fBbreak\fP,
\fBcontinue\fP,
\fBdeclare\fP,
\fBeval\fP,
\fBexit\fP,

\fBsource\fP,
\fBtimes\fP,
\fBtrap\fP and
\fBunset\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
In addition, various error conditions associated with the above builtins
or \fBexec\fP cause a non\-interactive shell to exit and an interactive
shell to return to its top\-level processing\&.
.PP
Furthermore, the \fBgetopts\fP builtin behaves in a POSIX\-compatible
fashion in that the associated variable \fBOPTIND\fP is not made
local to functions\&.

\fBPOSIX_IDENTIFIERS\fP <K> <S>
When this option is set, only the ASCII characters \fBa\fP to \fBz\fP, \fBA\fP to
\fBZ\fP, \fB0\fP to \fB9\fP and \fB_\fP may be used in identifiers (names
of shell parameters and modules)\&.
.RS
.PP
In addition, setting this option limits the effect of parameter
substitution with no braces, so that the expression \fB$#\fP is treated as
the parameter \fB$#\fP even if followed by a valid parameter name\&.
When it is unset, zsh allows expresions of the form \fB$#\fP\fIname\fP
to refer to the length of \fB$\fP\fIname\fP, even for special variables,
for example in expressions such as \fB$#\-\fP and \fB$#*\fP\&.
.PP
When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i\&.e\&. it
is compiled in and the option \fBMULTIBYTE\fP is set), then additionally any
alphanumeric characters in the local character set may be used in
identifiers\&.  Note that scripts and functions written with this feature are
not portable, and also that both options must be set before the script
or function is parsed; setting them during execution is not sufficient
as the syntax \fIvariable\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP has already been parsed as
a command rather than an assignment\&.
.PP
If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this option is
ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers\&.
This is non\-standard but is the traditional zsh behaviour\&.

\fBPOSIX_STRINGS\fP <K> <S>
This option affects processing of quoted strings\&.  Currently it only

portable character set corresponding to US ASCII\&.
.RS
.PP
When this option is not set, null characters embedded within strings
of the form \fB$\&'\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB'\fP are treated as ordinary characters\&. The
entire string is maintained within the shell and output to files where
necessary, although owing to restrictions of the library interface
the string is truncated at the null character in file names, environment
variables, or in arguments to external programs\&.
.PP
When this option is set, the \fB$\&'\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB'\fP expression is truncated at
the null character\&.  Note that remaining parts of the same string
beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated\&.
.PP
For example, the command line argument \fBa$\&'b\e0c'd\fP is treated with
the option off as the characters \fBa\fP, \fBb\fP, null, \fBc\fP, \fBd\fP,
and with the option on as the characters \fBa\fP, \fBb\fP, \fBd\fP\&.

\fBPOSIX_TRAPS\fP <K> <S>
When this option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing
traps for \fBEXIT\fP on exit from shell functions is suppressed\&.
In that case, manipulating \fBEXIT\fP traps always alters the global
trap for exiting the shell; the \fBLOCAL_TRAPS\fP option is
ignored for the \fBEXIT\fP trap\&.  Furthermore, a \fBreturn\fP statement
executed in a trap with no argument passes back from the function the
value from the surrounding context, not from code executed within the
trap\&.

\fBSH_FILE_EXPANSION\fP <K> <S>
Perform filename expansion (e\&.g\&., \fB~\fP expansion) \fIbefore\fP

.SH "NAME"
zshparam \- zsh parameters
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/params.yo
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes\&.
A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
characters and underscores, or the single characters
`\fB*\fP\&', `\fB@\fP', `\fB#\fP', `\fB?\fP', `\fB\-\fP', `\fB$\fP', or `\fB!\fP'\&.
A parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also
referred to as a \fIvariable\fP\&.
.PP
The attributes of a parameter determine the \fItype\fP of its value, often
referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control
other processing that may be applied to the value when it is referenced\&.
The value type may be a \fIscalar\fP (a string, an integer, or a floating
point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an \fIassociative\fP
array (an unordered set of name\-value pairs, indexed by name, also
referred to as a \fIhash\fP)\&.
.PP
Named scalar parameters may have the \fIexported\fP, \fB\-x\fP, attribute, to
copy them into the process environment, which is then passed from the
shell to any new processes that it starts\&.  Exported parameters are called
\fIenvironment variables\fP\&. The shell also \fIimports\fP environment variables
at startup time and automatically marks the corresponding parameters as
exported\&.  Some environment variables are not imported for reasons of
security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of
other shell features\&.
.PP
Parameters may also be \fIspecial\fP, that is, they have a predetermined
meaning to the shell\&.  Special parameters cannot have their type changed
or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special parameter is
unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained\&.
.PP
To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or numeric value
to a scalar parameter, use the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.
.PP
The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by writing:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In scalar assignment, \fIvalue\fP is expanded as a single string, in
which the elements of arrays are joined together; filename expansion is
not performed unless the option \fBGLOB_ASSIGN\fP is set\&.
.PP
When the integer attribute, \fB\-i\fP, or a floating point attribute, \fB\-E\fP
or \fB\-F\fP, is set for \fIname\fP, the \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic
evaluation\&.  Furthermore, by replacing `\fB=\fP\&' with `\fB+=\fP', a parameter
can be incremented or appended to\&.  See the section `Array Parameters\&' and
\fIArithmetic Evaluation\fP (in \fIzshexpn\fP(1))
for additional forms of assignment\&.
.PP
Note that assignment may implicitly change the attributes of a parameter\&.
For example, assigning a number to a variable in arithmetic evaluation may
change its type to integer or float, and with \fBGLOB_ASSIGN\fP assigning a
pattern to a variable may change its type to an array\&.
.PP
To reference the value of a parameter, write `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\&' or
`\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP\&'\&.  See
\fIParameter Expansion\fP in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)
for complete details\&.  That section also explains the effect
of the difference between scalar and array assignment on parameter
expansion\&.

.RS
.nf

.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Every \fIkey\fP must have a \fIvalue\fP in this case\&.  Note that this
assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear in
the list\&.  The append syntax may also be used with an associative array:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB+=(\fP\fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and

.SS "Array Subscripts"
Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript\&.  A
subscript of the form `\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]\fP\&' selects the single element
\fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is an arithmetic expression which will be subject
to arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by
`\fB$((\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB))\fP\&'\&.  The elements are numbered
beginning with 1, unless the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is set in which case
they are numbered from zero\&.
.PP
Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus
`\fB${foo[2]}\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB$foo[2]\fP'\&.  If the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP
option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts\&.
.PP
If the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is not set, then by default accesses to
an array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an
empty string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as
an error\&.  For backward compatibility the \fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP
option can be set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see
the description of the option in \fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that
no arithmetic expansion is applied to \fIexp\fP\&.  However, the parsing
rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way that
certain special characters must be protected from interpretation\&.  See
\fISubscript Parsing\fP below for details\&.
.PP
A subscript of the form `\fB[*]\fP\&' or `\fB[@]\fP' evaluates to all elements
of an array; there is no difference between the two except when they
appear within double quotes\&.
`\fB"$foo[*]"\fP\&' evaluates to `\fB"$foo[1] $foo[2] \fP\&.\&.\&.\fB"\fP', whereas
`\fB"$foo[@]"\fP\&' evaluates to `\fB"$foo[1]" "$foo[2]" \fP\&.\&.\&.'\&.  For
associative arrays, `\fB[*]\fP\&' or `\fB[@]\fP' evaluate to all the values,
in no particular order\&.  Note that this does not substitute
the keys; see the documentation for the `\fBk\fP\&' flag under
\fIParameter Expansion Flags\fP in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)
for complete details\&.
When an array parameter is referenced as `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\&' (with no
subscript) it evaluates to `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\fB[*]\fP\&', unless the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP
option is set in which case it evaluates to `\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB[0]}\fP\&' (for
an associative array, this means the value of the key `\fB0\fP\&', which may
not exist even if there are values for other keys)\&.
.PP
A subscript of the form `\fB[\fP\fIexp1\fP\fB,\fP\fIexp2\fP\fB]\fP\&'
selects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
inclusive\&. (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support
ranges\&.) If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
say \fB\-\fP\fIn\fP, then the \fIn\fPth element from the end
of the array is used\&.  Thus `\fB$foo[\-3]\fP\&' is the third element
from the end of the array \fBfoo\fP, and
`\fB$foo[1,\-1]\fP\&' is the same as `\fB$foo[*]\fP'\&.
.PP
Subscripting may also be performed on non\-array values, in which
case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted\&.
For example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to `\fBfoobar\fP\&', then
`\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP\&' prints `\fBooba\fP'\&.  Note that
some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern matching,
and in that case the substring extends from the start of the match
of the first subscript to the end of the match of the second
subscript\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBstring="abcdefghijklm"
print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
prints `\fBdefghi\fP\&'\&.  This is an obvious generalisation of the
rule for single\-character matches\&.  For a single subscript,
only a single character is referenced (not the range of characters
covered by the match)\&.
.PP
Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled
differently by the \fBr\fP and \fBR\fP subscript flags: the former takes the
shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match\&.  Hence
in the former case a \fB*\fP at the end is redundant while in
the latter case it matches the whole remainder of the string\&.  This
does not affect the result of the single subscript case as here the
length of the match is irrelevant\&.
.PP
.SS "Array Element Assignment"
.PP
A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In this form of assignment the element or range specified by \fIexp\fP
is replaced by the expression on the right side\&.  An array (but not an
associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element\&.
Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an
element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting the
other elements to accommodate the new values\&.  (This is not supported for
associative arrays\&.)
.PP
This syntax also works as an argument to the \fBtypeset\fP command:

.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset\fP \fB"\fP\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]"=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fIvalue\fP may \fInot\fP be a parenthesized list in this case; only
single\-element assignments may be made with \fBtypeset\fP\&.  Note that quotes
are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being interpreted
as filename generation operators\&.  The \fBnoglob\fP precommand modifier
could be used instead\&.
.PP
To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign `\fB()\fP\&' to
that element\&.  To delete an element of an associative array, use the
\fBunset\fP command:

.RS
.nf
\fBunset\fP \fB"\fP\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS "Subscript Flags"
If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript
expression is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up
to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
`\fIname\fP\fB[(\fP\fIflags\fP\fB)\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The flags \fBs\fP, \fBn\fP and \fBb\fP take an argument; the delimiter
is shown below as `\fB:\fP\&', but any character, or the matching pairs
`\fB(\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&', `\fB{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP', `\fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP', or
`\fB<\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB>\fP\&', may be used, but note that `\fB<\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB>\fP' can only be
used if the subscript is inside a double quoted expression or a
parameter substitution enclosed in braces as otherwise the expression is
interpreted as a redirection\&.
.PP
The flags currently understood are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBw\fP
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on words instead of characters\&.  The default word
separator is whitespace\&.  This flag may not be used with the \fBi\fP or
\fBI\fP flag\&.
.TP
\fBs:\fP\fIstring\fP\fB:\fP
This gives the \fIstring\fP that separates words (for use with the
\fBw\fP flag)\&.  The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBp\fP
Recognize the same escape sequences as the \fBprint\fP builtin in
the string argument of a subsequent `\fBs\fP\&' flag\&.
.TP
\fBf\fP
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on lines instead of characters, i\&.e\&. with elements
separated by newlines\&.  This is a shorthand for `\fBpws:\en:\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBr\fP
Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the \fIexp\fP is taken as a
pattern and the result is the first matching array element, substring or
word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a
scalar and the `\fBw\fP\&' flag is given, respectively)\&.  The subscript used
is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as
`\fB$foo[(r)??,3]\fP\&' and `\fB$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]\fP' are
possible if the parameter is not an associative array\&.  If the
parameter is an associative array, only the value part of each pair is
compared to the pattern, and the result is that value\&.
.RS
.PP
If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the
subscript to one past the end of the array, and hence
\fB${array[(r)\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB]}\fP will substitute the empty string\&.  Thus the
success of a search can be tested by using the \fB(i)\fP flag, for
example (assuming the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not in effect):
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} \-le ${#array} ]]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is in effect, the \fB\-le\fP should be replaced by \fB\-lt\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBR\fP
Like `\fBr\fP\&', but gives the last match\&.  For associative arrays, gives
all possible matches\&. May be used for assigning to ordinary array
elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays\&.  On failure, for
normal arrays this has the effect of returning the element corresponding to
subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP or
\fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP is in effect\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that in subscripts with both `\fBr\fP\&' and `\fBR\fP' pattern characters
are active even if they were substituted for a parameter (regardless of the
setting of \fBGLOB_SUBST\fP which controls this feature in normal pattern
matching)\&.  The flag `\fBe\fP\&' can be added to inhibit pattern matching\&.  As
this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution, care is still
required; using a parameter to hold the key has the desired effect:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBkey2=\&'original key'
print ${array[(Re)$key2]}\fP
.fi
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBi\fP
Like `\fBr\fP\&', but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
combined with a second argument\&.  On the left side of an assignment,
behaves like `\fBr\fP\&'\&.  For associative arrays, the key part of each pair
is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the
result\&.  On failure substitutes the length of the array plus one, as
discussed under the description of `\fBr\fP\&', or the empty string for an
associative array\&.
.TP
\fBI\fP
Like `\fBi\fP\&', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible
matching keys in an associative array\&.  On failure substitutes 0, or
the empty string for an associative array\&.  This flag is best when
testing for values or keys that do not exist\&.
.TP
\fBk\fP
If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys
to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first key
found where \fIexp\fP is matched by the key\&.  Note this could be any
such key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined\&.
This flag does not work on the left side of an assignment to an associative
array element\&.  If used on another type of parameter, this behaves like `\fBr\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBK\fP
On an associative array this is like `\fBk\fP\&' but returns all values where
\fIexp\fP is matched by the keys\&.  On other types of parameters this has
the same effect as `\fBR\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBn:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
If combined with `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP' or `\fBI\fP', makes them give
the \fIn\fPth or \fIn\fPth last match (if \fIexpr\fP evaluates to
\fIn\fP)\&.  This flag is ignored when the array is associative\&.
The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBb:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
If combined with `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP' or `\fBI\fP', makes them begin
at the \fIn\fPth or \fIn\fPth last element, word, or character (if \fIexpr\fP
evaluates to \fIn\fP)\&.  This flag is ignored when the array is associative\&.
The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBe\fP
This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed on the
subscript to use plain string matching instead\&.  Hence
`\fB${array[(re)*]}\fP\&' matches only the array element whose value is \fB*\fP\&.
Note that other forms of substitution such as parameter substitution are
not inhibited\&.
.RS
.PP
This flag can also be used to force \fB*\fP or \fB@\fP to be interpreted as
a single key rather than as a reference to all values\&.  It may be used
for either purpose on the left side of an assignment\&.
.RE
.PP
See \fIParameter Expansion Flags\fP (\fIzshexpn\fP(1)) for additional ways to manipulate the results of array subscripting\&.

.SS "Subscript Parsing"
.PP
This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to
patterns used for reverse subscripting (the `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP',
etc\&. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear
as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript\&.
.PP
To avoid subscript parsing limitations in assignments to associative array
elements, use the append syntax:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB
   aa+=(\&'key with "*strange*" characters' 'value string')
\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all
text between the opening `\fB[\fP\&' and the closing `\fB]\fP' is interpreted
\fIas if\fP it were in double quotes (see \fIzshmisc\fP(1))\&.  However, unlike double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript
expressions may appear inside double\-quoted strings or inside other
subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important
differences\&.
.PP
The first difference is that brackets (`\fB[\fP\&' and `\fB]\fP') must appear as
balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a
backslash (`\fB\e\fP\&')\&.  Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike
true double\-quoting) the sequence `\fB\e[\fP\&' becomes `\fB[\fP', and similarly
`\fB\e]\fP\&' becomes `\fB]\fP'\&.  This applies even in cases where a backslash is
not normally required; for example, the pattern `\fB[^[]\fP\&' (to match any
character other than an open bracket) should be written `\fB[^\e[]\fP\&' in a
reverse\-subscript pattern\&.  However, note that `\fB\e[^\e[\e]\fP\&' and even
`\fB\e[^[]\fP\&' mean the \fIsame\fP thing, because backslashes are always
stripped when they appear before brackets!
.PP
The same rule applies to parentheses (`\fB(\fP\&' and `\fB)\fP') and
braces (`\fB{\fP\&' and `\fB}\fP'): they must appear either in balanced pairs or
preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or
braces are removed during parsing\&.  This is because parameter expansions
may be surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by
balanced parentheses\&.
.PP
The second difference is that a double\-quote (`\fB"\fP\&') may appear as part
of a subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash, and
therefore that the two characters `\fB\e"\fP\&' remain as two characters in the
subscript (in true double\-quoting, `\fB\e"\fP\&' becomes `\fB"\fP')\&.  However,
because of the standard shell quoting rules, any double\-quotes that appear
must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash\&.  This makes
it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an odd
number of double\-quote characters, but the reason for this difference is
so that when a subscript expression appears inside true double\-quotes, one
can still write `\fB\e"\fP\&' (rather than `\fB\e\e\e"\fP') for `\fB"\fP'\&.
.PP
To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the
\fBtypeset\fP builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to
the value of that key, again use double quotes:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-A aa
typeset "aa[one\e"two\e"three\e"quotes]"=QQQ
print "$aa[one\e"two\e"three\e"quotes]"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a
parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript
expression\&.  That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes
within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from
the innermost subscript outwards\&.  Parameters are also expanded from the
innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to right
in the outer expression\&.
.PP
A further complication arises from a way in which subscript parsing is
\fInot\fP different from double quote parsing\&.  As in true double\-quoting,
the sequences `\fB\e*\fP\&', and `\fB\e@\fP' remain as two characters when they
appear in a subscript expression\&.  To use a literal `\fB*\fP\&' or `\fB@\fP' as
an associative array key, the `\fBe\fP\&' flag must be used:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-A aa
aa[(e)*]=star
print $aa[(e)*]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed\&.
Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first expanded and
then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern\&.  This has two
effects: first, parameters behave as if \fBGLOB_SUBST\fP were on (and it
cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once
when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern\&.  In a
reverse subscript, it\&'s necessary to use \fIfour\fP backslashes to cause a
single backslash to match literally in the pattern\&.  For complex patterns,
it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and then
refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then the backslashes,
brackets, parentheses, etc\&., are seen only when the complete expression is
converted to a pattern\&.  To match the value of a parameter literally in a
reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern,
use `\fB${(q\fP\fB)\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP\&' (see \fIzshexpn\fP(1)) to quote the expanded value\&.
.PP
Note that the `\fBk\fP\&' and `\fBK\fP' flags are reverse subscripting for an
ordinary array, but are \fInot\fP reverse subscripting for an associative
array!  (For an associative array, the keys in the array itself are
interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string
in that case\&.)
.PP
One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric names
of positional parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so for example `\fB$2foo\fP\&' is equivalent to
`\fB${2}foo\fP\&'\&.  Therefore, to use subscript syntax to extract a substring
from a positional parameter, the expansion must be surrounded by braces;
for example, `\fB${2[3,5]}\fP\&' evaluates to the third through fifth
characters of the second positional parameter, but `\fB$2[3,5]\fP\&' is the
entire second parameter concatenated with the filename generation pattern
`\fB[3,5]\fP\&'\&.
.PP
.SH "POSITIONAL PARAMETERS"
The positional parameters provide access to the command\-line arguments
of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see
the section `Invocation\&', and also the section `Functions'\&.
The parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
is the \fIn\fPth positional parameter\&.
The parameter `\fB$0\fP\&' is a special case, see
the section `Parameters Set By The Shell\&'\&.
.PP
The parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP and \fBargv\fP are
arrays containing all the positional parameters;
thus `\fB$argv[\fP\fIn\fP\fB]\fP\&', etc\&., is equivalent to simply `\fB$\fP\fIn\fP'\&.
Note that the options \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP or \fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP apply
to these arrays as well, so with either of those options set,
`\fB${argv[0]}\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB$1\fP' and so on\&.
.PP
Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by
using the \fBset\fP builtin, by assigning to the \fBargv\fP array, or by direct
assignment of the form `\fIn\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\&' where \fIn\fP is the number of
the positional parameter to be changed\&.  This also creates (with empty
values) any of the positions from 1 to \fIn\fP that do not already have
values\&.  Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assignment of the form `\fIn\fP\fB=(\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&' is
allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at positions greater
than \fIn\fP by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values\&.
.PP
.SH "LOCAL PARAMETERS"
Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters\&.
(Parameters are dynamically scoped\&.)  The \fBtypeset\fP builtin, and its
alternative forms \fBdeclare\fP, \fBinteger\fP, \fBlocal\fP and \fBreadonly\fP
(but not \fBexport\fP), can be used to declare a parameter as being local
to the innermost scope\&.
.PP
When a parameter is read or assigned to, the
innermost existing parameter of that name is used\&.  (That is, the
local parameter hides any less\-local parameter\&.)  However, assigning
to a non\-existent parameter, or declaring a new parameter with \fBexport\fP,
causes it to be created in the \fIouter\fPmost scope\&.
.PP
Local parameters disappear when their scope ends\&.
\fBunset\fP can be used to delete a parameter while it is still in scope;
any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden\&.
.PP
Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special
attributes unless either the existing or the newly\-created parameter
has the \fB\-h\fP (hide) attribute\&.  This may have unexpected effects:
there is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the
point the variable is made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero
in the case of integers)\&.  
The following:
.PP

recently\&.  Note that in the case of shell functions the line
number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition,
not necessarily as displayed by the \fBfunctions\fP builtin\&.
.TP
\fBLOGNAME\fP
If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the
shell, it is initialized to the login name corresponding to the
current login session\&. This parameter is exported by default but
this can be disabled using the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.  The value
is set to the string returned by the \fIgetlogin\fP(3) system call
if that is available\&.
.TP
\fBMACHTYPE\fP
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model),

.TP
\fBRANDOM\fP <S>
A pseudo\-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated each time
this parameter is referenced\&.  The random number generator
can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to \fBRANDOM\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
The values of \fBRANDOM\fP form an intentionally\-repeatable pseudo\-random

in identical pseudo\-random values unless the value of \fBRANDOM\fP is
referenced or seeded in the parent shell in between subshell invocations\&.

.TP
\fBSECONDS\fP <S>
The number of seconds since shell invocation\&.  If this parameter
is assigned a value, then the value returned upon reference
will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds
since the assignment\&.
.RS
.PP
Unlike other special parameters, the type of the \fBSECONDS\fP parameter can
be changed using the \fBtypeset\fP command\&.  Only integer and one of the
floating point types are allowed\&.  For example, `\fBtypeset \-F SECONDS\fP\&'
causes the value to be reported as a floating point number\&.  The
value is available to microsecond accuracy, although the shell may
show more or fewer digits depending on the use of \fBtypeset\fP\&.  See

\fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP <S>
In an \fBalways\fP block, indicates whether the preceding list of code
caused an error\&.  The value is 1 to indicate an error, 0 otherwise\&.
It may be reset, clearing the error condition\&.  See
\fIComplex Commands\fP in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)
.TP
\fBTRY_BLOCK_INTERRUPT\fP <S>
This variable works in a similar way to \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP, but
represents the status of an interrupt from the signal SIGINT, which
typically comes from the keyboard when the user types \fB^C\fP\&.  If set to
0, any such interrupt will be reset; otherwise, the interrupt is
propagated after the \fBalways\fP block\&.

\fBTTY\fP
The name of the tty associated with the shell, if any\&.
.TP
\fBTTYIDLE\fP <S>
The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in seconds or \-1 if there
is no such tty\&.
.TP
\fBUID\fP <S>
The real user ID of the shell process\&.  If you have sufficient privileges,
you may change the user ID of the shell by assigning to this parameter\&.
Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command
under a different

\fBUSERNAME\fP <S>
The username corresponding to the real user ID of the shell process\&.  If you

\fBVENDOR\fP
The vendor, as determined at compile time\&.
.TP
\fBzsh_eval_context\fP <S> <Z> (\fBZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT\fP <S>)
An array (colon\-separated list) indicating the context of shell
code that is being run\&.  Each time a piece of shell code that
is stored within the shell is executed a string is temporarily appended to
the array to indicate the type of operation that is being performed\&.
Read in order the array gives an indication of the stack of
operations being performed with the most immediate context last\&.

\fBstty\fP
Code passed to \fBstty\fP by the \fBSTTY\fP environment variable\&.
Normally this is passed directly to the system\&'s \fBstty\fP command,

.TP
\fBtoplevel\fP
The highest execution level of a script or interactive shell\&.
.TP
\fBtrap\fP
Code executed as a trap defined by the \fBtrap\fP builtin\&.  Traps

\fBZSH_NAME\fP
Expands to the basename of the command used to invoke this instance
of zsh\&.
.TP
\fBZSH_PATCHLEVEL\fP
The revision string for the version number of the ChangeLog file
in the zsh distribution\&.  This is most useful in order to keep
track of versions of the shell during development between releases;
hence most users should not use it and should instead rely on
\fB$ZSH_VERSION\fP\&.
.TP
\fBzsh_scheduled_events\fP
See the section `The zsh/sched Module\&' in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.
.TP
\fBZSH_SUBSHELL\fP
Readonly integer\&.  Initially zero, incremented each time the shell forks
to create a subshell for executing code\&.  Hence `\fB(print $ZSH_SUBSHELL)\fP\&'
and `\fBprint $(print $ZSH_SUBSHELL)\fP\&' output 1, while
`\fB( (print $ZSH_SUBSHELL) )\fP\&' outputs 2\&.
.TP
\fBZSH_VERSION\fP
The version number of the release of zsh\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS USED BY THE SHELL"
The following parameters are used by the shell\&.  Again, `<S>\&' indicates
that the parameter is special and `<Z>\&' indicates that the parameter does
not exist when the shell initializes in \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP emulation mode\&.
.PP
In cases where there are two parameters with an upper\- and lowercase
form of the same name, such as \fBpath\fP and \fBPATH\fP, the lowercase form
is an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the elements of the
array joined together by colons\&.  These are similar to tied parameters
created via `\fBtypeset \-T\fP\&'\&.  The normal use for the colon\-separated
form is for exporting to the environment, while the array form is easier
to manipulate within the shell\&.  Note that unsetting either of the pair
will unset the other; they retain their special properties when
recreated, and recreating one of the pair will recreate the other\&.
.PP
.PD 0

\fBARGV0\fP
If exported, its value is used as the \fBargv[0]\fP of external commands\&.
Usually used in constructs like `\fBARGV0=emacs nethack\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBBAUD\fP
The rate in bits per second at which data reaches the terminal\&.
The line editor will use this value in order to compensate for a slow
terminal by delaying updates to the display until necessary\&.  If the
parameter is unset or the value is zero the compensation mechanism is
turned off\&.  The parameter is not set by default\&.
.RS
.PP
This parameter may be profitably set in some circumstances, e\&.g\&.

\fBCOLUMNS\fP <S>
The number of columns for this terminal session\&.
Used for printing select lists and for the line editor\&.
.TP
\fBCORRECT_IGNORE\fP
If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction\&.  Any
potential correction that matches the pattern is ignored\&.  For example,
if the value is `\fB_*\fP\&' then completion functions (which, by
convention, have names beginning with `\fB_\fP\&') will never be offered
as spelling corrections\&.  The pattern does not apply to the correction
of file names, as applied by the \fBCORRECT_ALL\fP option (so with the
example just given files beginning with `\fB_\fP\&' in the current
directory would still be completed)\&.
.TP
\fBCORRECT_IGNORE_FILE\fP
If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction of file names\&.
Any file name that matches the pattern is never offered as a correction\&.
For example, if the value is `\fB\&.*\fP\&' then dot file names will never be
offered as spelling corrections\&.  This is useful with the
\fBCORRECT_ALL\fP option\&.
.TP
\fBDIRSTACKSIZE\fP
The maximum size of the directory stack, by default there is no limit\&.  If the
stack gets larger than this, it will be truncated automatically\&.
This is useful with the \fBAUTO_PUSHD\fP option\&.
.TP
\fBENV\fP
If the \fBENV\fP environment variable is set when zsh is invoked as \fBsh\fP
or \fBksh\fP, \fB$ENV\fP is sourced after the profile scripts\&.  The value of
\fBENV\fP is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname\&.  Note that
\fBENV\fP is \fInot\fP used unless zsh is emulating \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP\&.
.TP
\fBFCEDIT\fP
The default editor for the \fBfc\fP builtin\&.  If \fBFCEDIT\fP is not set,
the parameter \fBEDITOR\fP is used; if that is not set either, a builtin
default, usually \fBvi\fP, is used\&.
.TP
\fBfignore\fP <S> <Z> (\fBFIGNORE\fP <S>)
An array (colon separated list)

during filename completion\&.  However, if completion only generates files
with suffixes in this list, then these files are completed anyway\&.
.TP
\fBfpath\fP <S> <Z> (\fBFPATH\fP <S>)
An array (colon separated list)

function definitions\&.  This path is searched when a function
with the \fB\-u\fP attribute is referenced\&.  If an executable
file is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment\&.
.TP
\fBhistchars\fP <S>
Three characters used by the shell\&'s history and lexical analysis
mechanism\&.  The first character signals the start of a history
expansion (default `\fB!\fP\&')\&.  The second character signals the
start of a quick history substitution (default `\fB^\fP\&')\&.  The third
character is the comment character (default `\fB#\fP\&')\&.

If unset, the history is not saved\&.
.TP
\fBHISTORY_IGNORE\fP
If set, is treated as a pattern at the time history files are written\&.
Any potential history entry that matches the pattern is skipped\&.  For
example, if the value is `\fBfc *\fP\&' then commands that invoke the
interactive history editor are never written to the history file\&.

\fBHISTSIZE\fP <S>
The maximum number of events stored in the internal history list\&.

\fBHOME\fP <S>
The default argument for the \fBcd\fP command\&.  This is not set automatically

\fBIFS\fP <S>
Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL), that
are used to separate words which result from
command or parameter expansion and words read by
the \fBread\fP builtin\&.  Any characters from the set space, tab and
newline that appear in the IFS are called \fIIFS white space\fP\&.
One or more IFS white space characters or one non\-IFS white space
character together with any adjacent IFS white space character delimit
a field\&.  If an IFS white space character appears twice consecutively
in the IFS, this character is treated as if it were not an IFS white
space character\&.

\fBKEYBOARD_HACK\fP
This variable defines a character to be removed from the end of the
command line before interpreting it (interactive shells only)\&. It is
intended to fix the problem with keys placed annoyingly close to return

backquotes only\&.  Should the chosen character be one of singlequote,
doublequote or backquote, there must also be an odd number of them

\fBLANG\fP should contain a value that reflects the character set in
use, even if it is a single\-byte character set, unless only the

\fBSPROMPT\fP <S>
The prompt used for spelling correction\&.  The sequence

\fBSTTY\fP
If this parameter is set in a command\&'s environment, the shell runs the
\fBstty\fP command with the value of this parameter as arguments in order to
set up the terminal before executing the command\&. The modes apply only to the
command, and are reset when it finishes or is suspended\&. If the command is
suspended and continued later with the \fBfg\fP or \fBwait\fP builtins it will
see the modes specified by \fBSTTY\fP, as if it were not suspended\&.  This
(intentionally) does not apply if the command is continued via `\fBkill
\-CONT\fP\&'\&.  \fBSTTY\fP is ignored if the command is run in the background, or
if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in
the input line\&. This avoids running stty at every external command by
accidentally exporting it\&. Also note that \fBSTTY\fP should not be used for
window size specifications; these will not be local to the command\&.

\fBTERM\fP <S>
The type of terminal in use\&.  This is used when looking up termcap

\fBTERMINFO\fP <S>
A reference to a compiled description of the terminal, used by the

for example, the string `\fB\ee[?5h\ee[?5l\fP\&' on a vt100 or xterm will have
the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you usually use reverse

\fBZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS\fP
These parameters are used by the line editor\&.  In certain circumstances
suffixes (typically space or slash) added by the completion system
will be removed automatically, either because the next editing command
was not an insertable character, or because the character was marked
as requiring the suffix to be removed\&.
.RS

These variables can contain the sets of characters that will cause the

Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the prompt

.SH "NAME"
zshroadmap \- informal introduction to the zsh manual
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/roadmap.yo
The Zsh Manual, like the shell itself, is large and often complicated\&.
This section of the manual provides some pointers to areas of the shell
that are likely to be of particular interest to new users, and indicates
where in the rest of the manual the documentation is to be found\&.
.PP
.SH "WHEN THE SHELL STARTS"
.PP
When it starts, the shell reads commands from various files\&.  These can
be created or edited to customize the shell\&.  See the section
Startup/Shutdown Files in \fIzsh\fP(1)\&.
.PP
If no personal initialization files exist for the current user, a function
is run to help you change some of the most common settings\&.  It won\&'t
appear if your administrator has disabled the \fBzsh/newuser\fP module\&.
The function is designed to be self\-explanatory\&.  You can run it by hand
with `\fBautoload \-Uz zsh\-newuser\-install; zsh\-newuser\-install \-f\fP\&'\&.
See also
the section User Configuration Functions in \fIzshcontrib\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.SH "INTERACTIVE USE"
.PP
Interaction with the shell uses the builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE\&.  This is
described in detail in \fIzshzle\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The first decision a user must make is whether to use the Emacs or Vi
editing mode as the keys for editing are substantially different\&.  Emacs
editing mode is probably more natural for beginners and can be selected
explicitly with the command \fBbindkey \-e\fP\&.
.PP
A history mechanism for retrieving previously typed lines (most simply
with the Up or Down arrow keys) is available; note that, unlike other
shells, zsh will not save these lines when the shell exits unless you
set appropriate variables, and the number of history lines retained by
default is quite small (30 lines)\&.  See the description of the shell
variables (referred to in the documentation as parameters) \fBHISTFILE\fP,
\fBHISTSIZE\fP and \fBSAVEHIST\fP in \fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.  Note that it\&'s
currently only possible to read and write files saving history
when the shell is interactive, i\&.e\&. it does not work from scripts\&.
.PP
The shell now supports the UTF\-8 character set (and also others if
supported by the operating system)\&.  This is (mostly) handled transparently
by the shell, but the degree of support in terminal emulators is variable\&.
There is some discussion of this in the shell FAQ,
\fBhttp://www\&.zsh\&.org/FAQ/\fP\&.  Note in particular that for combining
characters to be handled the option \fBCOMBINING_CHARS\fP needs to be set\&.
Because the shell is now more sensitive to the definition of the
character set, note that if you are upgrading from an older version of
the shell you should ensure that the appropriate variable, either
\fBLANG\fP (to affect all aspects of the shell\&'s operation) or
\fBLC_CTYPE\fP (to affect only the handling of character sets) is set to
an appropriate value\&.  This is true even if you are using a
single\-byte character set including extensions of ASCII such as
\fBISO\-8859\-1\fP or \fBISO\-8859\-15\fP\&.  See the description of \fBLC_CTYPE\fP
in
\fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.SS "Completion"
.PP
Completion is a feature present in many shells\&. It allows the user to
type only a part (usually the prefix) of a word and have the shell fill
in the rest\&.  The completion system in zsh is programmable\&.  For
example, the shell can be set to complete email addresses in
arguments to the mail command from your \fB~/\&.abook/addressbook\fP;
usernames, hostnames, and even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so
on\&.  Anything that can be written in or glued together with zsh can be
the source of what the line editor offers as possible completions\&.
.PP
Zsh has two completion systems, an old, so called \fBcompctl\fP completion
(named after the builtin command that serves as its complete and only
user interface), and a new one, referred to as \fBcompsys\fP,
organized as library of builtin and user\-defined functions\&.
The two systems differ in their interface for specifying the completion
behavior\&.  The new system is more customizable and is supplied with
completions for many commonly used commands; it is therefore to be
preferred\&.
.PP
The completion system must be enabled explicitly when the shell starts\&.
For more information see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.SS "Extending the line editor"
.PP
Apart from completion, the line editor is highly extensible by means of
shell functions\&.  Some useful functions are provided with the shell; they
provide facilities such as:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBinsert\-composed\-char\fP
composing characters not found on the keyboard
.TP
\fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP
configuring what the line editor considers a word when moving or
deleting by word
.TP
\fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-backward\-end\fP, etc\&.
alternative ways of searching the shell history
.TP
\fBreplace\-string\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\fP
functions for replacing strings or patterns globally in the command line
.TP
\fBedit\-command\-line\fP
edit the command line with an external editor\&.
.PP
See the section `ZLE Functions\&' in \fIzshcontrib\fP(1) for descriptions of these\&.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The shell has a large number of options for changing its behaviour\&.
These cover all aspects of the shell; browsing the full documentation is
the only good way to become acquainted with the many possibilities\&.  See
\fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.SH "PATTERN MATCHING"
.PP
The shell has a rich set of patterns which are available for file matching
(described in the documentation as `filename generation\&' and also known for
historical reasons as `globbing\&') and for use when programming\&.  These are
described in the section `Filename Generation\&' in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Of particular interest are the following patterns that are not commonly
supported by other systems of pattern matching:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB**\fP
for matching over multiple directories
.TP
\fB~\fP, \fB^\fP
the ability to exclude patterns from matching when the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP
option is set
.TP
\fB(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP
glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the end of the pattern,
which select files by type (such as directories) or attribute (such as
size)\&.
.PP
.SH "GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX"
.PP
Although the syntax of zsh is in ways similar to the Korn shell, and
therefore more remotely to the original UNIX shell, the Bourne shell,
its default behaviour does not entirely correspond to those shells\&.
General shell syntax is introduced in the section `Shell Grammar\&' in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.
.PP
One commonly encountered difference is that variables substituted onto the
command line are not split into words\&.  See the description of the shell option
\fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP in
the section `Parameter Expansion\&' in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)\&.
In zsh, you can either explicitly request the splitting (e\&.g\&. \fB${=foo}\fP)
or use an array when you want a variable to expand to more than one word\&.  See
the section `Array Parameters\&' in \fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.SH "PROGRAMMING"
.PP
The most convenient way of adding enhancements to the shell is typically
by writing a shell function and arranging for it to be autoloaded\&.
Functions are described in the section `Functions\&' in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.  Users changing from the C shell and its
relatives should notice that aliases are less used in zsh as they don\&'t
perform argument substitution, only simple text replacement\&.
.PP
A few general functions, other than those for the line editor described
above, are provided with the shell and are described in
\fIzshcontrib\fP(1)\&.  Features include:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBpromptinit\fP
a prompt theme system for changing prompts easily, see the section
`Prompt Themes\&'

.TP
\fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP
a MIME\-handling system which dispatches commands according to the suffix of
a file as done by graphical file managers
.TP
\fBzcalc\fP
a calculator
.TP
\fBzargs\fP
a version of \fBxargs\fP that makes the \fBfind\fP command redundant
.TP
\fBzmv\fP
a command for renaming files by means of shell patterns\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A module \fBzsh/net/tcp\fP is provided to provide network I/O over
TCP/IP from within the shell; see its description in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  This manual page describes a function suite based on the module\&.  
If the module is installed, the functions are usually installed at the
same time, in which case they will be available for
autoloading in the default function search path\&.  In addition to the
\fBzsh/net/tcp\fP module, the \fBzsh/zselect\fP module is used to implement
timeouts on read operations\&.  For troubleshooting tips, consult the
corresponding advice for the \fBzftp\fP functions described in
\fIzshzftpsys\fP(1)\&.
.PP
There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations open, close,
read and send, named \fBtcp_open\fP etc\&., as well as a function
\fBtcp_expect\fP for pattern match analysis of data read as input\&.  The
system makes it easy to receive data from and send data to multiple named
sessions at once\&.  In addition, it can be linked with the shell\&'s line
editor in such a way that input data is automatically shown at the
terminal\&.  Other facilities available including logging, filtering and
configurable output prompts\&.
.PP
To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to
`\fBautoload \-U tcp_open\fP\&' and run \fBtcp_open\fP as documented below to
start a session\&.  The \fBtcp_open\fP function will autoload the remaining
functions\&.

\fBtcp_open\fP [ \fB\-qz\fP ] [ \fB\-a\fP \fIfd\fP | \fB\-f\fP \fIfd\fP ] [ \fIsess\fP ]
Open a new session\&.  In the first and simplest form, open a TCP connection
to host \fIhost\fP at port \fIport\fP; numeric and symbolic forms are
understood for both\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIsess\fP is given, this becomes the name of the session which can be
used to refer to multiple different TCP connections\&.  If \fIsess\fP is
not given, the function will invent a numeric name value (note this is
\fInot\fP the same as the file descriptor to which the session is attached)\&.
It is recommended that session names not include `funny\&' characters, where
funny characters are not well\-defined but certainly do not include
alphanumerics or underscores, and certainly do include whitespace\&.
.PP
In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given by name\&.
A single session name is given after \fB\-s\fP and a comma\-separated list
after \fB\-l\fP; both options may be repeated as many times as necessary\&.
A failure to open any session causes \fBtcp_open\fP to abort\&.
The host and port are read from the file \fB\&.ztcp_sessions\fP in the same
directory as the user\&'s zsh initialisation files, i\&.e\&. usually the home
directory, but \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP if that is set\&.  The file consists of lines
each giving a session name and the corresponding host and port, in that
order (note the session name comes first, not last), separated by
whitespace\&.
.PP
The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections\&.  If the option
\fB\-a\fP is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for listening for
connections\&.  No function front\-end is provided to open such a file
descriptor, but a call to `\fBztcp \-l\fP \fIport\fP\&' will create one with the
file descriptor stored in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP\&.  The listening port can
be closed with `\fBztcp \-c\fP \fIfd\fP\&'\&.  A call to `\fBtcp_open \-a\fP \fIfd\fP'
will block until a remote TCP connection is made to \fIport\fP on the local
machine\&.  At this point, a session is created in the usual way and is
largely indistinguishable from an active connection created with one of the
first two forms\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-f\fP is used, its argument is a file descriptor which is
used directly as if it were a TCP session\&.  How well the remainder of the
TCP function system copes with this depends on what actually underlies this
file descriptor\&.  A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO (pipe) of
some sort will work better, but note that it is not a good idea for two
different sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at once\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-q\fP is given with any of the three forms, \fBtcp_open\fP
will not print informational messages, although it will in any case exit
with an appropriate status\&.
.PP
If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case if the
shell is interactive, \fBtcp_open\fP installs a handler inside zle which
will check for new data at the same time as it checks for keyboard input\&.
This is convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting; the
test is performed by the operating system\&.  Giving the option \fB\-z\fP to
any of the forms of \fBtcp_open\fP prevents the handler from being
installed, so data must be read explicitly\&.  Note, however, this is not
necessary for executing complete sets of send and read commands from a
function, as zle is not active at this point\&.  Generally speaking, the
handler is only active when the shell is waiting for input at a command
prompt or in the \fBvared\fP builtin\&.  The option has no effect if zle is not
active; `\fB[[ \-o zle]]\fP\&' will test for this\&.
.PP
The first session to be opened becomes the current session and subsequent
calls to \fBtcp_open\fP do not change it\&.  The current session is stored
in the parameter \fB$TCP_SESS\fP; see below for more detail about the
parameters used by the system\&.

is opened\&.  See the description below\&.

or all open sessions if \fB\-a\fP is given\&.  The options \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-s\fP are
both handled for consistency with \fBtcp_open\fP, although the latter is
redundant\&.
.RS
.PP
If the session being closed is the current one, \fB$TCP_SESS\fP is unset,
leaving no current session, even if there are other sessions still open\&.
.PP
If the session was opened with \fBtcp_open \-f\fP, the file descriptor is
closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible directly from the
command line\&.  If the option \fB\-n\fP is given, no attempt will be made to
close file descriptors in this case\&.  The \fB\-n\fP option is not used for
genuine \fBztcp\fP session; the file descriptors are always closed with the
session\&.

The function checks for new data available on all the sessions listed\&.
Unless the \fB\-b\fP option is given, it will not block waiting for new data\&.
Any one line of data from any of the available sessions will be read,
stored in the parameter \fB$TCP_LINE\fP, and displayed to standard output
unless \fB$TCP_SILENT\fP contains a non\-empty string\&.  When printed to
standard output the string \fB$TCP_PROMPT\fP will be shown at the start of
the line; the default form for this includes the name of the session being
read\&.  See below for more information on these parameters\&.  In this mode,
\fBtcp_read\fP can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2 which
indicates all pending input from all specified sessions has been handled\&.
.PP
With the option \fB\-b\fP, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the function
will block until a line is available to read from one of the specified
sessions\&.  However, only a single line is returned\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-d\fP indicates that all pending input should be drained\&.  In
this case \fBtcp_read\fP may process multiple lines in the manner given
above; only the last is stored in \fB$TCP_LINE\fP, but the complete set is
stored in the array \fB$tcp_lines\fP\&.  This is cleared at the start of each
call to \fBtcp_read\fP\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-T\fP specify a timeout in seconds, which may be a
floating point number for increased accuracy\&.  With \fB\-t\fP the timeout is
applied before each line read\&.  With \fB\-T\fP, the timeout applies to the
overall operation, possibly including multiple read operations if the
option \fB\-d\fP is present; without this option, there is no distinction
between \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-T\fP\&.
.PP
The function does not print informational messages, but if the option
\fB\-q\fP is given, no error message is printed for a non\-existent session\&.

The option \fB\-c\fP causes \fBtcp_send\fP to behave like \fBcat\fP\&.  It reads

With the option \fB\-s\fP, per\-session logging is enabled\&.  Input from

Sessions are specified in the same way as \fBtcp_read\fP: the default is to
use the current session, otherwise the sessions specified by \fB\-a\fP,

.PP
Each \fIpattern\fP is a standard zsh extended\-globbing pattern; note that it
needs to be quoted to avoid it being expanded immediately by filename
generation\&.  It must match the full line, so to match a substring there
must be a `\fB*\fP\&' at the start and end\&.  The line matched against includes
the \fB$TCP_PROMPT\fP added by \fBtcp_read\fP\&.  It is possible to include the
globbing flags `\fB#b\fP\&' or `\fB#m\fP' in the patterns to make backreferences
available in the parameters \fB$MATCH\fP, \fB$match\fP, etc\&., as described in
the base zsh documentation on pattern matching\&.
.PP
Unlike \fBtcp_read\fP, the default behaviour of \fBtcp_expect\fP is to block
indefinitely until the required input is found\&.  This can be modified by
specifying a timeout with \fB\-t\fP or \fB\-T\fP; these function as in
\fBtcp_read\fP, specifying a per\-read or overall timeout, respectively, in
seconds, as an integer or floating\-point number\&.  As \fBtcp_read\fP, the
function returns status 2 if a timeout occurs\&.
.PP
The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns given match\&.  If
the caller needs to know which of the patterns matched, the option \fB\-p\fP
\fIvar\fP can be used; on return, \fB$var\fP is set to the number of the
pattern using ordinary zsh indexing, i\&.e\&. the first is 1, and so on\&.  Note
the absence of a `\fB$\fP\&' in front of \fIvar\fP\&.  To avoid clashes, the
parameter cannot begin with `\fB_expect\fP\&'\&.  The index \-1 is used if
there is a timeout and 0 if there is no match\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-P\fP \fIvar\fP works similarly to \fB\-p\fP, but instead of
numerical indexes the regular arguments must begin with a prefix
followed by a colon: that prefix is then used as a tag to which \fIvar\fP
is set when the argument matches\&.  The tag \fBtimeout\fP is used if there
is a timeout and the empty string if there is no match\&.  Note it is
acceptable for different arguments to start with the same prefix if the
matches do not need to be distinguished\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-q\fP is passed directly down to \fBtcp_read\fP\&.
.PP
As all input is done via \fBtcp_read\fP, all the usual rules about output of
lines read apply\&.  One exception is that the parameter \fB$tcp_lines\fP will
only reflect the line actually matched by \fBtcp_expect\fP; use
\fB$tcp_expect_lines\fP for the full set of lines read during the function
call\&.

If the parameter is already floating point, it is used without a local

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
distribution as an interface to the \fBzftp\fP builtin command, allowing you
to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions
or scripts\&.  The interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e\&.g\&. the
\fBftp\fP command itself, see \fIftp\fP(1)), but as it is entirely done
within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing features,
and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they
are just ordinary shell functions\&.
.PP
The prerequisite is that the \fBzftp\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)
, must be available in the
version of \fBzsh\fP installed at your site\&.  If the shell is configured to
load new commands at run time, it probably is: typing `\fBzmodload zsh/zftp\fP\&'
will make sure (if that runs silently, it has worked)\&.  If this is not the
case, it is possible \fBzftp\fP was linked into the shell anyway: to test
this, type `\fBwhich zftp\fP\&' and if \fBzftp\fP is available you will get the
message `\fBzftp: shell built\-in command\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Commands given directly with \fBzftp\fP builtin may be interspersed between
the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using \fBzftp\fP directly may
cause some of the status information stored in shell parameters to become
invalid\&.  Note in particular the description of the variables
\fB$ZFTP_TMOUT\fP, \fB$ZFTP_PREFS\fP and \fB$ZFTP_VERBOSE\fP for \fBzftp\fP\&.

.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
You should make sure all the functions from the \fBFunctions/Zftp\fP
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the
two letters `\fBzf\fP\&'\&.  They may already have been installed on your system;
otherwise, you will need to find them and copy them\&.  The directory should
appear as one of the elements of the \fB$fpath\fP array (this should already
be the case if they were installed), and at least the function \fBzfinit\fP
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest\&.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the \fBzfinit\fP function\&.  The
following code in your \fB\&.zshrc\fP will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory \fB~/myfns\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
autoload \-U zfinit
zfinit\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that \fBzfinit\fP assumes you are using the \fBzmodload\fP method to
load the \fBzftp\fP command\&.  If it is already built into the shell, change
\fBzfinit\fP to \fBzfinit \-n\fP\&.  It is helpful (though not essential) if the
call to \fBzfinit\fP appears after any code to initialize the new completion
system, else unnecessary \fBcompctl\fP commands will be given\&.
.PP
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.PP
The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the
same as that in a standard FTP client\&.  Note that, due to a quirk of the
shell\&'s \fBgetopts\fP builtin, for those functions that handle options you
must use `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' rather than `\fB\-\fP' to ensure the remaining arguments
are treated literally (a single `\fB\-\fP\&' is treated as an argument)\&.

Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is

This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command
line before \fBzfcd\fP receives a string\&.  For example, suppose the command
is `\fBzfcd ~/foo\fP\&'\&.  The shell will expand this to a full path such as
`\fBzfcd /home/user2/pws/foo\fP\&'\&.  At this stage, \fBzfcd\fP recognises the
initial path as corresponding to `\fB~\fP\&' and will send the directory to

repeated use of `\fBzfdir /pub/gnu\fP\&' will only require the directory to be

the \fB\-r\fP option\&.  As relative directories will confuse
\fBzfdir\fP, the \fB\-f\fP option can be used to force the cache to be flushed

option has no effect\&.

As \fBzfget\fP, but only retrieve files where the version on the remote
server is newer (has a later modification time), or where the local file
does not exist\&.  If the remote file is older but the files have different
sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user
will usually be queried\&.  With the option \fB\-s\fP, the command runs silently
and will always retrieve the file in either of those two cases\&.  With the
option \fB\-v\fP, the command prints more information about the files while it
is working out whether or not to transfer them\&.
.TP
\fBzfcget\fP [ \fB\-Gt\fP ] \fIfile1\fP \&.\&.\&.
As \fBzfget\fP, but if any of the local files exists, and is shorter than
the corresponding remote file, the command assumes that it is the result of
a partially completed transfer and attempts to transfer the rest of the
file\&.  This is useful on a poor connection which keeps failing\&.

file, but only the basename is used for the remote file name\&.

With the option \fB\-r\fP, if any of the \fIfiles\fP are directories they are
sent recursively with all their subdirectories, including files beginning

semantics, since `\fB/\fP\&' is used as a directory separator\&.

A problem arises if you attempt to use \fBzfpcp\fP \fIlfile1\fP \fIrdir\fP,
i\&.e\&. the second form of copying but with two arguments, as the command has
no simple way of knowing if \fIrdir\fP corresponds to a directory or a
filename\&.  It attempts to resolve this in various ways\&.  First, if the
\fIrdir\fP argument is `\fB\&.\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\&.\fP' or ends in a slash, it is assumed
to be a directory\&.  Secondly, if the operation of copying to a remote file
in the first form failed, and the remote server sends back the expected
failure code 553 and a reply including the string `\fBIs a directory\fP\&',
then \fBzfpcp\fP will retry using the second form\&.

\fBzfsession\fP [ \fB\-lvod\fP ] [ \fIsessname\fP ]
Allows you to manage multiple FTP sessions at once\&.  By default,
connections take place in a session called `\fBdefault\fP\&'; by giving the
command `\fBzfsession\fP \fIsessname\fP\&' you can change to a new or existing
session with a name of your choice\&.  The new session remembers its own
connection, as well as associated shell parameters, and also the host/user
parameters set by \fBzfparams\fP\&.  Hence you can have different sessions set
up to connect to different hosts, each remembering the appropriate host,
user and password\&.

With no arguments, \fBzfsession\fP prints the name of the current session;
with the option \fB\-l\fP it lists all sessions which currently exist, and
with the option \fB\-v\fP it gives a verbose list showing the host and
