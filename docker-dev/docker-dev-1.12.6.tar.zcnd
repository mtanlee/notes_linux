.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtput\fR utility uses the \fBterminfo\fR database to make the
values of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
the shell (see \fBsh\fR(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or
return the long name of the requested terminal type.
The result depends upon the capability's type:
.RS
.TP 5
string
\fBtput\fR writes the string to the standard output.
No trailing newline is supplied.
.TP
integer
\fBtput\fR writes the decimal value to the standard output,
with a trailing newline.
.TP
boolean
\fBtput\fR simply sets the exit code
(\fB0\fR for TRUE if the terminal has the capability,
\fB1\fR for FALSE if it does not),
and writes nothing to the standard output.
.RE
.PP
Before using a value returned on the standard output,
the application should test the exit code
(e.g., \fB$?\fR, see \fBsh\fR(1)) to be sure it is \fB0\fR.
(See the \fBEXIT CODES\fR and \fBDIAGNOSTICS\fR sections.)
For a complete list of capabilities
and the \fIcapname\fR associated with each, see \fBterminfo\fR(5).
.TP
\fB-T\fR\fItype\fR
indicates the \fItype\fR of terminal.  Normally this option is
unnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment
variable \fBTERM\fR.  If \fB-T\fR is specified, then the shell
variables \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR will be ignored,and the
operating system will not be queried for the actual screen size.
.TP
\fIcapname\fR
indicates the capability from the \fBterminfo\fR database.  When
\fBtermcap\fR support is compiled in, the \fBtermcap\fR name for
the capability is also accepted.
.TP
\fIparms\fR
If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the arguments
\fIparms\fR will be instantiated into the string.
.IP
Most parameters are numbers.
Only a few terminfo capabilities require string parameters;
\fBtput\fR uses a table to decide which to pass as strings.
Normally \fBtput\fR uses \fBtparm\fR (3X) to perform the substitution.
If no parameters are given for the capability,
\fBtput\fR writes the string without performing the substitution.
.TP
\fB-S\fR
allows more than one capability per invocation of \fBtput\fR.  The
capabilities must be passed to \fBtput\fR from the standard input
instead of from the command line (see example).
Only one \fIcapname\fR is allowed per line.
The \fB-S\fR option changes the
meaning of the \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR boolean and string exit codes (see the
EXIT CODES section).
.IP
Again, \fBtput\fR uses a table and the presence of parameters in its input
to decide whether to use \fBtparm\fR (3X),
and how to interpret the parameters.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.TP
\fBinit\fR
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the user's
terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR, above), the following will
occur:
.RS
.TP
(1)
if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be
output as detailed in the \fBterminfo\fR(5) section on
.IR "Tabs and Initialization" ,
.TP
(2)
any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry will
be set in the tty driver,
.TP
(3)
tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to
the specification in the entry, and
.TP
(4)
if tabs are not expanded,
standard tabs will be set (every 8 spaces).
.RE
.IP
If an entry does not
contain the information needed for any of the four above activities,
that activity will silently be skipped.
.TP
\fBreset\fR
Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal's
reset strings will be output if present (\fBrs1\fR, \fBrs2\fR, \fBrs3\fR, \fBrf\fR).
If the reset strings are not present, but initialization
strings are, the initialization strings will be output.
Otherwise, \fBreset\fR acts identically to \fBinit\fR.
.TP
\fBlongname\fR
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the
user's terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR above), then the long name
of the terminal will be put out.  The long name is the last
name in the first line of the terminal's description in the
\fBterminfo\fR database [see \fBterm\fR(5)].
.PP
If \fBtput\fR is invoked by a link named \fBreset\fR, this has the
same effect as \fBtput reset\fR.
See \fBtset\fR for comparison, which has similar behavior.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
\fBtput init\fR
Initialize the terminal according to the type of
terminal in the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR.  This
command should be included in everyone's .profile after
the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR has been exported, as
illustrated on the \fBprofile\fR(5) manual page.
.TP 5
\fBtput -T5620 reset\fR
Reset an AT&T 5620 terminal, overriding the type of
terminal in the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup 0 0\fR
Send the sequence to move the cursor to row \fB0\fR, column \fB0\fR
(the upper left corner of the screen, usually known as the "home"
cursor position).
.TP 5
\fBtput clear\fR
Echo the clear-screen sequence for the current terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput cols\fR
Print the number of columns for the current terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput -T450 cols\fR
Print the number of columns for the 450 terminal.
.TP 5
\fBbold=`tput smso` offbold=`@TPUT@ rmso`\fR
Set the shell variables \fBbold\fR, to begin stand-out mode
sequence, and \fBoffbold\fR, to end standout mode sequence,
for the current terminal.  This might be followed by a
prompt: \fBecho "${bold}Please type in your name: ${offbold}\\c"\fR
.TP 5
\fBtput hc\fR
Set exit code to indicate if the current terminal is a hard copy terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup 23 4\fR
Send the sequence to move the cursor to row 23, column 4.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup\fR
Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement, with no parameters substituted.
.TP 5
\fBtput longname\fR
Print the long name from the \fBterminfo\fR database for the
type of terminal specified in the environmental
variable \fBTERM\fR.
.PP
.RS 5
\fBtput -S <<!\fR
.br
\fB> clear\fR
.br
\fB> cup 10 10\fR
.br
\fB> bold\fR
.br
\fB> !\fR
.RE
.TP 5
\&
This example shows \fBtput\fR processing several capabilities in one invocation.
It clears the screen,
moves the cursor to position 10, 10
and turns on bold (extra bright) mode.
The list is terminated by an exclamation mark (\fB!\fR) on a line by itself.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fB\*d\fR
compiled terminal description database
.TP
\fB/usr/share/tabset/*\fR
tab settings for some terminals, in a format
appropriate to be output to the terminal (escape
sequences that set margins and tabs); for more
information, see the "Tabs and Initialization"
section of \fBterminfo\fR(5)
.SH EXIT CODES
If the \fB-S\fR option is used,
\fBtput\fR checks for errors from each line,
and if any errors are found, will set the exit code to 4 plus the
number of lines with errors.
If no errors are found, the exit code is \fB0\fR.
No indication of which line failed can be given so
exit code \fB1\fR will never appear.  Exit codes \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, and
\fB4\fR retain their usual interpretation.
If the \fB-S\fR option is not used,
the exit code depends on the type of \fIcapname\fR:
.RS 5
.TP
.I boolean
a value of \fB0\fR is set for TRUE and \fB1\fR for FALSE.
.TP
.I string
a value of \fB0\fR is set if the
\fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR (the value of
\fIcapname\fR is returned on standard output);
a value of \fB1\fR is set if \fIcapname\fR
is not defined for this terminal \fItype\fR
(nothing is written to standard output).
.TP
.I integer
a value of \fB0\fR is always set,
whether or not \fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR.
To determine if \fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR,
the user must test the value written to standard output.
A value of \fB-1\fR
means that \fIcapname\fR is not defined for this terminal \fItype\fR.
.TP
.I other
\fBreset\fR or \fBinit\fR may fail to find their respective files.
In that case, the exit code is set to 4 + \fBerrno\fR.
.RE
.PP
Any other exit code indicates an error; see the DIAGNOSTICS section.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.SH PORTABILITY
.PP
The \fBlongname\fR and \fB-S\fR options, and the parameter-substitution
features used in the \fBcup\fR example, are not supported in BSD curses or in
AT&T/USL curses before SVr4.
.PP
X/Open documents only the operands for \fBclear\fP, \fBinit\fP and \fBreset\fP.
In this implementation, \fBclear\fP is part of the \fIcapname\fR support.
Other implementations of \fBtput\fP on
SVr4-based systems such as Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX
as well as others such as AIX and Tru64
provide support for \fIcapname\fR operands.
A few platforms such as FreeBSD and NetBSD recognize termcap names rather
than terminfo capability names in their respective \fBtput\fP commands.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution
or deletion of selected characters.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Complement the set of characters in
.Ar string1 ,
that is
.Dq Fl C Li ab
includes every character except for
.Ql a
and
.Ql b .
.It Fl c
Same as
.Fl C
but complement the set of values in
.Ar string1 .
.It Fl d
Delete characters in
.Ar string1
from the input.
.It Fl s
Squeeze multiple occurrences of the characters listed in the last
operand (either
.Ar string1
or
.Ar string2 )
in the input into a single instance of the character.
This occurs after all deletion and translation is completed.
.It Fl u
Guarantee that any output is unbuffered.
.El
.Pp
In the first synopsis form, the characters in
.Ar string1
are translated into the characters in
.Ar string2
where the first character in
.Ar string1
is translated into the first character in
.Ar string2
and so on.
If
.Ar string1
is longer than
.Ar string2 ,
the last character found in
.Ar string2
is duplicated until
.Ar string1
is exhausted.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form, the characters in
.Ar string1
are deleted from the input.
.Pp
In the third synopsis form, the characters in
.Ar string1
are compressed as described for the
.Fl s
option.
.Pp
In the fourth synopsis form, the characters in
.Ar string1
are deleted from the input, and the characters in
.Ar string2
are compressed as described for the
.Fl s
option.
.Pp
The following conventions can be used in
.Ar string1
and
.Ar string2
to specify sets of characters:
.Bl -tag -width [:equiv:]
.It character
Any character not described by one of the following conventions
represents itself.
.It \eoctal
A backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits represents a character
with that encoded value.
To follow an octal sequence with a digit as a character, left zero-pad
the octal sequence to the full 3 octal digits.
.It \echaracter
A backslash followed by certain special characters maps to special
values.
.Pp
.Bl -column "\ea"
.It "\ea	<alert character>
.It "\eb	<backspace>
.It "\ef	<form-feed>
.It "\en	<newline>
.It "\er	<carriage return>
.It "\et	<tab>
.It "\ev	<vertical tab>
.El
.Pp
A backslash followed by any other character maps to that character.
.It c-c
For non-octal range endpoints
represents the range of characters between the range endpoints, inclusive,
in ascending order,
as defined by the collation sequence.
If either or both of the range endpoints are octal sequences, it
represents the range of specific coded values between the
range endpoints, inclusive.
.Pp
.Bf Em
See the
.Sx COMPATIBILITY
section below for an important note regarding
differences in the way the current
implementation interprets range expressions differently from
previous implementations.
.Ef
.It [:class:]
Represents all characters belonging to the defined character class.
Class names are:
.Pp
.Bl -column "phonogram"
.It "alnum	<alphanumeric characters>
.It "alpha	<alphabetic characters>
.It "blank	<whitespace characters>
.It "cntrl	<control characters>
.It "digit	<numeric characters>
.It "graph	<graphic characters>
.It "ideogram	<ideographic characters>
.It "lower	<lower-case alphabetic characters>
.It "phonogram	<phonographic characters>
.It "print	<printable characters>
.It "punct	<punctuation characters>
.It "rune	<valid characters>
.It "space	<space characters>
.It "special	<special characters>
.It "upper	<upper-case characters>
.It "xdigit	<hexadecimal characters>
.El
.Pp
.\" All classes may be used in
.\" .Ar string1 ,
.\" and in
.\" .Ar string2
.\" when both the
.\" .Fl d
.\" and
.\" .Fl s
.\" options are specified.
.\" Otherwise, only the classes ``upper'' and ``lower'' may be used in
.\" .Ar string2
.\" and then only when the corresponding class (``upper'' for ``lower''
.\" and vice-versa) is specified in the same relative position in
.\" .Ar string1 .
.\" .Pp
When
.Dq Li [:lower:]
appears in
.Ar string1
and
.Dq Li [:upper:]
appears in the same relative position in
.Ar string2 ,
it represents the characters pairs from the
.Dv toupper
mapping in the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
When
.Dq Li [:upper:]
appears in
.Ar string1
and
.Dq Li [:lower:]
appears in the same relative position in
.Ar string2 ,
it represents the characters pairs from the
.Dv tolower
mapping in the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.Pp
With the exception of case conversion,
characters in the classes are in unspecified order.
.Pp
For specific information as to which
.Tn ASCII
characters are included
in these classes, see
.Xr ctype 3
and related manual pages.
.It [=equiv=]
Represents all characters belonging to the same equivalence class as
.Ar equiv ,
ordered by their encoded values.
.It [#*n]
Represents
.Ar n
repeated occurrences of the character represented by
.Ar # .
This
expression is only valid when it occurs in
.Ar string2 .
If
.Ar n
is omitted or is zero, it is be interpreted as large enough to extend
.Ar string2
sequence to the length of
.Ar string1 .
If
.Ar n
has a leading zero, it is interpreted as an octal value, otherwise,
it is interpreted as a decimal value.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE
and
.Ev LC_COLLATE
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples are shown as given to the shell:
.Pp
Create a list of the words in file1, one per line, where a word is taken to
be a maximal string of letters.
.Pp
.D1 Li "tr -cs \*q[:alpha:]\*q \*q\en\*q < file1"
.Pp
Translate the contents of file1 to upper-case.
.Pp
.D1 Li "tr \*q[:lower:]\*q \*q[:upper:]\*q < file1"
.Pp
(This should be preferred over the traditional
.Ux
idiom of
.Dq Li "tr a-z A-Z" ,
since it works correctly in all locales.)
.Pp
Strip out non-printable characters from file1.
.Pp
.D1 Li "tr -cd \*q[:print:]\*q < file1"
.Pp
Remove diacritical marks from all accented variants of the letter
.Ql e :
.Pp
.Dl "tr \*q[=e=]\*q \*qe\*q"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Previous
.Fx
implementations of
.Nm
did not order characters in range expressions according to the current
locale's collation order, making it possible to convert unaccented Latin
characters (esp.\& as found in English text) from upper to lower case using
the traditional
.Ux
idiom of
.Dq Li "tr A-Z a-z" .
Since
.Nm
now obeys the locale's collation order, this idiom may not produce
correct results when there is not a 1:1 mapping between lower and
upper case, or when the order of characters within the two cases differs.
As noted in the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section above, the character class expressions
.Dq Li [:lower:]
and
.Dq Li [:upper:]
should be used instead of explicit character ranges like
.Dq Li a-z
and
.Dq Li A-Z .
.Pp
System V has historically implemented character ranges using the syntax
.Dq Li [c-c]
instead of the
.Dq Li c-c
used by historic
.Bx
implementations and
standardized by POSIX.
System V shell scripts should work under this implementation as long as
the range is intended to map in another range, i.e., the command
.Dq Li "tr [a-z] [A-Z]"
will work as it will map the
.Ql \&[
character in
.Ar string1
to the
.Ql \&[
character in
.Ar string2 .
However, if the shell script is deleting or squeezing characters as in
the command
.Dq Li "tr -d [a-z]" ,
the characters
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&]
will be
included in the deletion or compression list which would not have happened
under a historic System V implementation.
Additionally, any scripts that depended on the sequence
.Dq Li a-z
to
represent the three characters
.Ql a ,
.Ql \-
and
.Ql z
will have to be
rewritten as
.Dq Li a\e-z .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility has historically not permitted the manipulation of NUL bytes in
its input and, additionally, stripped NUL's from its input stream.
This implementation has removed this behavior as a bug.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility has historically been extremely forgiving of syntax errors,
for example, the
.Fl c
and
.Fl s
options were ignored unless two strings were specified.
This implementation will not permit illegal syntax.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Pp
It should be noted that the feature wherein the last character of
.Ar string2
is duplicated if
.Ar string2
has less characters than
.Ar string1
is permitted by POSIX but is not required.
Shell scripts attempting to be portable to other POSIX systems should use
the
.Dq Li [#*]
convention instead of relying on this behavior.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
initializes and configures the kernel trace subsystem.  Trace events can
be recorded to an in-memory buffer or logged directly to a file, and
optionally converted to a human-readable, plain-text format.
.Pp
.Nm
operates according to the command flag specified.
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Print a succinct help message to
.Xr stdout 4 .
.\"
.\"     ## trace -i ##
.It Fl i Op Fl b Ar num-events
.Pp
Initialize the kernel trace buffer.  This command is required before
tracing.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar num-events
Set the number of events that can be stored in the kernel trace buffer.
.Ar num-events
is a decimal number of events.  The default (and minimum) value is 8192
event records per logical CPU.  No more than half of available
memory may be used by trace buffers, though running with a buffer this
large is not recommended.
.El
.\"
.\"     ## trace -g ##
.It Fl g
Print the current kernel trace buffer settings to
.Xr stdout 4 .
.\"
.\"     ## trace -d ##
.It Fl d Op Fl a Ar pid | Fl x Ar pid
.Pp
By default, disable collection of events.  This command does not remove
the kernel trace buffer.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar pid
Disable event collection for the process identified by
.Ar pid .
.It Fl x Ar pid
Stop excluding
.Ar pid
from the trace.
This reenables event collection of events for.
.Ar pid .
.El
.\"
.\"     ## trace -r ##
.It Fl r
Remove the kernel trace buffer.
.\"
.\"     ## trace -n ##
.It Fl n
Disable ring buffer mode.  When set, the trace buffer will fill to capacity
and then stop collecting events.  Ring buffer mode is sometimes called
"head," "stop," or "no-wrap" mode.  By default, the trace buffer will
wrap around, overwriting previous events.  The default behavior is
sometimes called windowed or wrap-around mode.

.Sh TRACE CODES FORMAT
Event classes, subclasses, and codes are matched to names using a trace
codes file.  Any events that cannot be matched will be referred to by
their debugid in hex.
.Pp
The system-wide trace codes file is located at
.Pa /usr/share/misc/trace.codes .
Additional files are typically stored in
.Pa /usr/local/share/misc .
.Pp
A code file consists of a list of tracepoints, one per line, with the
tracepoint's debugid (component, subclass, and code) in hex, followed by
a tab, followed by the tracepoint's name.
.Pp
For instance, the MSC_mach_msg_trap tracepoint is defined by
.Pp
.Dl 0x010c007c MSC_mach_msg_trap
.Pp
This describes the tracepoint with the following info:
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent "Subclass" "MSC_mach_msg_trap"
.\" is this right?  We should refer to the shifting and kdebug.h
.It Sy Name Ta MSC_mach_msg_trap
.It Sy Class Ta 0x01 Ta (Mach events)
.It Sy Subclass Ta 0x0c Ta (Mach system calls)
.It Sy Code Ta 0x007c Ta (msg_trap)
.El
.Pp
See
.\" this absolute path no longer exists thanks to SDKs. :P
.Pa /usr/include/sys/kdebug.h
for class and subclass values.
.Sh TRACEFILTER FORMAT
A tracefilter description file consists of a list of class and subclass
filters in hex, one per line, which are applied as if they were passed
with
.Fl c
and
.Fl s .
Pass
.Fl v
to see what classes and subclasses are being set.
.Pp
Comment lines start with
.Ql # ,
class filter lines start with
.Ql C ,
and subclass filter lines start with
.Ql S
and include the class they apply to.
.Pp
For example, to trace Mach events (class 1):
.Pp
.Dl C 0x01
.Pp
And to trace Mach system calls (class 1, subclass 13):
.Pp
.Dl S 0x010C
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
usually requires multiple invocations in order to set up the trace
buffers, enable the correct events, and collect the events.  A typical
session with trace is:
.Pp
.Dl trace -i
.Dl trace -e -c 1 -s 31
.Dl sleep 1
.Dl trace -d
.Dl trace -t
.Pp
This initializes the trace buffers to their default values, enables the
mach_msg_trap subclass of the MACH_SysCall class, waits for one second,
then disables tracing and prints it to
.Xr stdout 4 .
This is useful for investigating isolated issues or gaining some
understanding about a kernel subsystem.  If a specific execuable should
be traced, with the events saved for later analysis, the sequence of
commands would be:
.Pp
.Dl trace -i
.Dl trace -E -c 0x4 ./my_prog
.Dl trace -d
.Dl trace -l tracefile
.Dl trace -R tracefile
.Pp
This initializes the trace buffers, enables all events in the BSC_SysCall class and runs
.Li my_prog ,
disables tracing, collects events into
.Li tracefile ,
and finally prints those events out in a human-readable form.
.Sh CAVEATS
Almost all
.Nm
command flags require superuser (root) privileges.
.Pp
After failures, the trace buffers usually need to be re-initialized.

Options can be used both with one dash and double dash.
It is not necessary to write the full name of the option.
A disambiguation prefix suffices.
.IP "\(bu" 4

Input file. Extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR is assumed if no extension is provided.
.IP "\(bu" 4

Output file. By default is the name of the input file (concatenated with .pm)
.IP "\(bu" 4

Name of the package containing the generated subroutines.

\&\f(CW\*(C`\-p[refix] treeprefix\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Tree nodes automatically generated using \f(CW\*(C`Parse::Eyapp\*(C'\fR are objects blessed 
into the name of the production. To avoid crashes the programmer may prefix 
the class names with a given prefix when calling the parser; for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->YYParse( yylex => \e&_Lexer, yyerror => \e&_Error, yyprefix => _\|_PACKAGE_\|_."::")
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-prefix treeprefix\*(C'\fR option simplifies the process of writing the tree 
grammar so that instead of writing with the full names
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& CLASS::TIMES(CLASS::NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Treereg\*(C'\fR translates a tree grammar specification
file (default extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR describing 
a set of tree patterns
and the actions to modify them 
using tree-terms like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  TIMES(NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }
.Ve
.PP
which says that wherever an abstract syntax tree representing
the product of a numeric expression with value 0 times
any other kind of expression, the \f(CW\*(C`TIMES\*(C'\fR tree can be substituted by
its left child.
.PP
The compiler produces a Perl module containing the subroutines
implementing those sets of pattern-actions.

Options can be used both with one dash and double dash.
It is not necessary to write the full name of the option.
A disambiguation prefix suffices.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i[n] filename\*(C'\fR

Input file. Extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR is assumed if no extension is provided.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
Output file. By default is the name of the input file (concatenated with .pm)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-m[od] packagename\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Name of the package containing the generated subroutines.

.IP "\(bu" 4

Specifies that \f(CW\*(C`/path/to/library/\*(C'\fR will be included in \f(CW@INC\fR.
Useful when the \f(CW\*(C`syntax\*(C'\fR option is on. Can be inserted as many times as necessary.

\&\f(CW\*(C`\-p[refix] treeprefix\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Tree nodes automatically generated using \f(CW\*(C`Parse::Eyapp\*(C'\fR are objects blessed 
into the name of the production. To avoid crashes the programmer may prefix 
the class names with a given prefix when calling the parser; for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->YYParse( yylex => \e&_Lexer, yyerror => \e&_Error, yyprefix => _\|_PACKAGE_\|_."::")
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-prefix treeprefix\*(C'\fR option simplifies the process of writing the tree 
grammar so that instead of writing with the full names
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& CLASS::TIMES(CLASS::NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Treereg\*(C'\fR translates a tree grammar specification
file (default extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR describing 
a set of tree patterns
and the actions to modify them 
using tree-terms like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  TIMES(NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }
.Ve
.PP
which says that wherever an abstract syntax tree representing
the product of a numeric expression with value 0 times
any other kind of expression, the \f(CW\*(C`TIMES\*(C'\fR tree can be substituted by
its left child.
.PP
The compiler produces a Perl module containing the subroutines
implementing those sets of pattern-actions.

Options can be used both with one dash and double dash.
It is not necessary to write the full name of the option.
A disambiguation prefix suffices.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i[n] filename\*(C'\fR

Input file. Extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR is assumed if no extension is provided.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
Output file. By default is the name of the input file (concatenated with .pm)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-m[od] packagename\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Name of the package containing the generated subroutines. 
By default is the longest prefix of the input file name that
conforms to the classic definition of integer \f(CW\*(C`[a\-z_A\-Z]\ew*\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l[ib] /path/to/library/\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Specifies that \f(CW\*(C`/path/to/library/\*(C'\fR will be included in \f(CW@INC\fR.
Useful when the \f(CW\*(C`syntax\*(C'\fR option is on. Can be inserted as many times as necessary.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-p[refix] treeprefix\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Tree nodes automatically generated using \f(CW\*(C`Parse::Eyapp\*(C'\fR are objects blessed 
into the name of the production. To avoid crashes the programmer may prefix 
the class names with a given prefix when calling the parser; for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->YYParse( yylex => \e&_Lexer, yyerror => \e&_Error, yyprefix => _\|_PACKAGE_\|_."::")
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-prefix treeprefix\*(C'\fR option simplifies the process of writing the tree 
grammar so that instead of writing with the full names
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& CLASS::TIMES(CLASS::NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }

it can be written:

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Treereg\*(C'\fR translates a tree grammar specification
file (default extension \f(CW\*(C`.trg\*(C'\fR describing 
a set of tree patterns
and the actions to modify them 
using tree-terms like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  TIMES(NUM, $x) and { $NUM\->{VAL} == 0) => { $NUM }
.Ve
.PP
which says that wherever an abstract syntax tree representing
the product of a numeric expression with value 0 times
any other kind of expression, the \f(CW\*(C`TIMES\*(C'\fR tree can be substituted by
its left child.
.PP
The compiler produces a Perl module containing the subroutines
implementing those sets of pattern-actions.

.TP \w'\-dname=s'u+2n
.B \-a
Generate an
.SM ASCII
approximation of the typeset output.
.
.TP
.B \-b
Print a backtrace with each warning or error message.
.
This backtrace should help track down the cause of the error.
.
The line numbers given in the backtrace may not always be correct, for
.BR troff 's
idea of line numbers gets confused by
.B as
or 
.B am
requests.
.
.TP
.B \-c
Disable color output (always disabled in compatibility mode).
.
.TP
.B \-C
Enable compatibility mode.
.
.TP
.BI \-d cs
.TQ
.BI \-d name = s
Define
.I c
or
.I name
to be a string
.IR s ;
.I c
must be a one letter name.
.
.TP
.B \-E
Inhibit all error messages of
.BR troff .
Note that this doesn't affect messages output to standard error by macro
packages using the
.B tm
or
.B tm1
requests.
.
.TP
.BI \-f fam
Use
.I fam
as the default font family.
.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Search in directory (or directory path)
.I dir
for subdirectories
.BI dev name
.RI ( name
is the name of the device) and there for the
.B DESC

is scanned before all other font directories.
.
.TP
.B \-i
Read the standard input after all the named input files have been
processed.
.
.TP
.BI \-I dir
This option may be used to specify a directory to search for
files (both those on the command line and those named in
.B \&.psbb
requests).
The current directory is always searched first.
This option may be specified more than once;
the directories will be searched in the order specified.
No directory search is performed for files specified using an absolute path.
.
.TP
.BI \-m name
Read in the file
.IB name .tmac\fR.
If it isn't found, try
.BI tmac. name
instead.
.
It will be first searched for in directories given with the
.B \-M
command line option, then in directories given in the
.B GROFF_TMAC_PATH
environment variable, then in the current directory (only if in unsafe
mode), the home directory, /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/site-tmac, and
/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac.

.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.TP
.BI \-w name
Enable warning
.IR  name .
Available warnings are described in the section

.SH WARNINGS
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The warnings that can be given by
.B troff
are divided into the following categories.
.
The name associated with each warning is used by the
.B \-w
and
.B \-W
options; the number is used by the
.B warn
request, and by the
.B .warn
register; it is always a power of 2 to allow bitwise composition.

In fill mode, lines which could not be broken so that their length was
less than the line length.
.
This is enabled by default.
.
.TP
.BR char "\t1"
Non-existent characters.
.
This is enabled by default.
.
.TP
.BR color "\t524288"
Color related warnings.
.

.B da
without an argument when there is no current diversion.
.
.TP
.BR el "\t16"
Use of the
.B el
request with no matching
.B ie
request.
.
.TP

Unrecognized escape sequences.
.
When an unrecognized escape sequence is encountered, the escape
character is ignored.
.
.TP
.BR font "\t131072"
Non-existent fonts.
.
This is enabled by default.
.
.TP
.BR ig "\t262144"
Invalid escapes in text ignored with the
.B ig
request.
.
These are conditions that are errors when they do not occur in ignored
text.
.
.TP
.BR input "\t16384"
Invalid input characters.
.
.TP
.BR mac "\t512"
Use of undefined strings, macros and diversions.
.
When an undefined string, macro or diversion is used, that string is
automatically defined as empty.
.
So, in most cases, at most one warning will be given for each name.
.
.TP
.BR missing "\t8192"
Requests that are missing non-optional arguments.
.
.TP
.BR number "\t2"
Invalid numeric expressions.

.
.TP
.BR reg "\t1024"
Use of undefined number registers.
.
When an undefined number register is used, that register is

.
So, in most cases, at most one warning will be given for use of a
particular name.
.
.TP
.BR right-brace "\t4096"
Use of
.B \[rs]}
where a number was expected.
.
.TP
.BR scale "\t32"
Meaningless scaling indicators.
.
.TP
.BR space "\t65536"
Missing space between a request or macro and its argument.
.
This warning will be given when an undefined name longer than two
characters is encountered, and the first two characters of the name
make a defined name.
.
The request or macro will not be invoked.
.
When this warning is given, no macro is automatically defined.
.
This is enabled by default.
.
This warning will never occur in compatibility mode.
.
.TP
.BR syntax "\t128"
Dubious syntax in numeric expressions.
.
.TP
.BR tab "\t2048"
Inappropriate use of a tab character.
Either use of a tab character where a number was expected, or use of tab
character in an unquoted macro argument.
.
.P
There are also names that can be used to refer to groups of warnings:
.
.TP
.B all
All warnings except
.BR di ,
.BR mac ,
and
.BR reg .
It is intended that this covers all warnings that are useful with
traditional macro packages.
.
.TP
.B w
All warnings.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fBTset\fR initializes terminals.
\fBTset\fR first determines the type of terminal that you are using.
This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found.
.PP
1. The \fBterminal\fR argument specified on the command line.
.PP
2. The value of the \fBTERM\fR environmental variable.
.PP
3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the standard
error output device in the \fI/etc/ttys\fR file.  (On Linux and
System-V-like UNIXes, \fIgetty\fR does this job by setting
\fBTERM\fR according to the type passed to it by \fI/etc/inittab\fR.)
.PP
4. The default terminal type, ``unknown''.
.PP
If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the \fB-m\fR
option mappings are then applied (see the section
.B TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
for more information).
Then, if the terminal type begins with a question mark (``?''), the
user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty
response confirms the type, or, another type can be entered to specify
a new type.  Once the terminal type has been determined, the terminfo
entry for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminfo entry is found
for the type, the user is prompted for another terminal type.
.PP
Once the terminfo entry is retrieved, the window size, backspace, interrupt
and line kill characters (among many other things) are set and the terminal
and tab initialization strings are sent to the standard error output.
Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have changed,
or are not set to their default values, their values are displayed to the
standard error output.
Use the \fB-c\fP or \fB-w\fP option to select only the window sizing
versus the other initialization.
If neither option is given, both are assumed.
.PP
When invoked as \fBreset\fR, \fBtset\fR sets cooked and echo modes,
turns off cbreak and raw modes, turns on newline translation and
resets any unset special characters to their default values before
doing the terminal initialization described above.  This is useful
after a program dies leaving a terminal in an abnormal state.  Note,
you may have to type
.sp
    \fB<LF>reset<LF>\fR
.sp
(the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal
to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state.
Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 5
.B -c
Set control characters and modes.
.B -e
Set the erase character to \fIch\fR.
.TP
.B -I
Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the terminal.
.TP
.B -i
Set the interrupt character to \fIch\fR.
.TP
.B -k
Set the line kill character to \fIch\fR.
.TP
.B -m
Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal.
See the section
.B TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
for more information.
.TP
.B -Q
Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill characters.
Normally \fBtset\fR displays the values for control characters which
differ from the system's default values.
.TP
.B -q
The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is
not initialized in any way.  The option `-' by itself is equivalent but
archaic.
.TP
.B -r
Print the terminal type to the standard error output.
.TP
.B -s
Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment variable
\fBTERM\fR to the standard output.
See the section
.B SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT
for details.
.TP
.B -V
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.TP
.B -w
Resize the window to match the size deduced via \fBsetupterm\fP.
Normally this has no effect,
unless \fBsetupterm\fP is not able to detect the window size.
.PP
The arguments for the \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, and \fB-k\fR
options may either be entered as actual characters or by using the `hat'
notation, i.e. control-h may be specified as ``^H'' or ``^h''.
.
.SH SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT
It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information about
the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment.
This is done using the \fB-s\fR option.
.PP
When the \fB-s\fR option is specified, the commands to enter the information
into the shell's environment are written to the standard output.  If
the \fBSHELL\fR environmental variable ends in ``csh'', the commands
are for \fBcsh\fR, otherwise, they are for \fBsh\fR.
Note, the \fBcsh\fR commands set and unset the shell variable
\fBnoglob\fR, leaving it unset.  The following line in the \fB.login\fR
or \fB.profile\fR files will initialize the environment correctly:
.sp
    eval \`tset -s options ... \`
.
.SH TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current
system information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the
\fI/etc/ttys\fR file or the \fBTERM\fR environmental variable is often
something generic like \fBnetwork\fR, \fBdialup\fR, or \fBunknown\fR.
When \fBtset\fR is used in a startup script it is often desirable to
provide information about the type of terminal used on such ports.
.PP
The purpose of the \fB-m\fR option is to map
from some set of conditions to a terminal type, that is, to
tell \fBtset\fR
``If I'm on this port at a particular speed, guess that I'm on that
kind of terminal''.
.PP
The argument to the \fB-m\fR option consists of an optional port type, an
optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional
colon (``:'') character and a terminal type.  The port type is a
string (delimited by either the operator or the colon character).  The
operator may be any combination of ``>'', ``<'', ``@'', and ``!''; ``>''
means greater than, ``<'' means less than, ``@'' means equal to
and ``!'' inverts the sense of the test.
The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared with the speed
of the standard error output (which should be the control terminal).
The terminal type is a string.
.PP
If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the \fB-m\fR
mappings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and baud
rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified, the
first applicable mapping is used.
.PP
For example, consider the following mapping: \fBdialup>9600:vt100\fR.
The port type is dialup , the operator is >, the baud rate
specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of
this mapping is to specify that if the terminal type is \fBdialup\fR,
and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of
\fBvt100\fR will be used.
.PP
If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any baud rate.
If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any port type.
For example, \fB-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm\fR
will cause any dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal
type vt100, and any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm.
Note, because of the leading question mark, the user will be
queried on a default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm
terminal.
.PP
No whitespace characters are permitted in the \fB-m\fR option argument.
Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that the
entire \fB-m\fR option argument be placed within single quote characters,
and that \fBcsh\fR users insert a backslash character (``\e'') before
any exclamation marks (``!'').
.SH HISTORY
The \fBtset\fR command appeared in BSD 3.0.  The \fBncurses\fR implementation
was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources for a terminfo environment by Eric
S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The \fBtset\fR utility has been provided for backward-compatibility with BSD
environments (under most modern UNIXes, \fB/etc/inittab\fR and \fIgetty\fR(1)
can set \fBTERM\fR appropriately for each dial-up line; this obviates what was
\fBtset\fR's most important use).  This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD
tset, with a few exceptions specified here.
.PP
The \fB-S\fR option of BSD tset no longer works; it prints an error message to stderr
and dies.  The \fB-s\fR option only sets \fBTERM\fR, not \fBTERMCAP\fP.  Both these
changes are because the \fBTERMCAP\fR variable is no longer supported under
terminfo-based \fBncurses\fR, which makes \fBtset -S\fR useless (we made it die
noisily rather than silently induce lossage).
.PP
There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking tset via a link named
`TSET` (or via any other name beginning with an upper-case letter) set the
terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been omitted.
.PP
The \fB-A\fR, \fB-E\fR, \fB-h\fR, \fB-u\fR and \fB-v\fR
options were deleted from the \fBtset\fR
utility in 4.4BSD.
None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are
of limited utility at best.
The \fB-a\fR, \fB-d\fR, and \fB-p\fR options are similarly
not documented or useful, but were retained as they appear to be in
widespread use.  It is strongly recommended that any usage of these
three options be changed to use the \fB-m\fR option instead.  The
-n option remains, but has no effect.  The \fB-adnp\fR options are therefore
omitted from the usage summary above.
.PP
It is still permissible to specify the \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, and \fB-k\fR options without
arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed to
explicitly specify the character.
.PP
As of 4.4BSD, executing \fBtset\fR as \fBreset\fR no longer implies the \fB-Q\fR
option.  Also, the interaction between the - option and the \fIterminal\fR
argument in some historic implementations of \fBtset\fR has been removed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The \fBtset\fR command uses these environment variables:
.TP 5
SHELL
tells \fBtset\fP whether to initialize \fBTERM\fP using \fBsh\fP or
\fBcsh\fP syntax.
.TP 5
TERM
Denotes your terminal type.
Each terminal type is distinct, though many are similar.
.TP 5
TERMCAP
may denote the location of a termcap database.
If it is not an absolute pathname, e.g., begins with a `/',
\fBtset\fP removes the variable from the environment before looking
for the terminal description.
.SH FILES
.TP 5
/etc/ttys
system port name to terminal type mapping database (BSD versions only).
.TP

.Nd topological sort of a directed graph
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl q
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes a list of pairs of node names representing directed arcs in
a graph and prints the nodes in topological order on standard output.
Input is taken from the named
.Ar file ,
or from standard input if no file
is given.
.Pp
Node names in the input are separated by white space and there must
be an even number of node pairs.
.Pp
Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from the node
to itself.
This is useful when a node is not connected to any other nodes.
.Pp
If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly sorted),
one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues.
Cycles are reported on standard error.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Search for and display the longest cycle.
Can take a very long time.
.It Fl q
Do not display informational messages about cycles.  This is primarily
intended for building libraries, where optimal ordering is not critical,
and cycles occur often.

.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence
which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified
by the environment variable
.Ev TERM .
The file
.Pa /etc/termcap
is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.
If the terminal is incapable of underlining, but is capable of
a standout mode then that is used instead.
If the terminal can overstrike,
or handles underlining automatically,
.Nm
degenerates to
.Xr cat 1 .
If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate
dashes `\-'; this is useful when you want to look at the underlining
which is present in an
.Xr nroff 1
output stream on a crt-terminal.
.It Fl t Ar terminal
Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with
.Ar terminal .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE
and
.Ev TERM
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr colcrt 1 ,
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr nroff 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr nroff 1
command usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines intermixed
with the text to indicate underlining.
No attempt is made to optimize
the backward motion.

utility processes the named files or the standard input writing
the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.
Backspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement
the column count for tab calculations.
The
.Nm
utility is useful for pre-processing character files
(before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that
contain tabs.
.Pp
The
.Nm unexpand
utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named
files and writes the result on the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
.Nm ( unexpand
only.)
By default, only leading blanks and tabs
are reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.
If the
.Fl a
option is given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the
resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
.It Fl t Sm Ar tab1 , tab2 , ... , tabn Sm
Set tab stops at column positions
.Ar tab1 , tab2 , ... , tabn .
If only a single number is given, tab stops are set that number of
column positions apart instead of the default number of 8.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the specified
.Ar input_file
comparing adjacent lines, and writes a copy of each unique input line to
the
.Ar output_file .
If
.Ar input_file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq Fl
or absent, the standard input is read.
If
.Ar output_file
is absent, standard output is used for output.
The second and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are
not written.
Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent,
so it may be necessary to sort the files first.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Precede each output line with the count of the number of times the line
occurred in the input, followed by a single space.
.It Fl d
Only output lines that are repeated in the input.
.It Fl f Ar num
Ignore the first
.Ar num
fields in each input line when doing comparisons.
A field is a string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent fields
by blanks.
Field numbers are one based, i.e., the first field is field one.
.It Fl s Ar chars
Ignore the first
.Ar chars
characters in each input line when doing comparisons.
If specified in conjunction with the
.Fl f
option, the first
.Ar chars
characters after the first
.Ar num
fields will be ignored.
Character numbers are one based, i.e., the first character is character one.
.It Fl u
Only output lines that are not repeated in the input.
.It Fl i
Case insensitive comparison of lines.
.\".It Fl Ns Ar n

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar filename

.Op Ar from-unit to-unit
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar filename
Specify the name of the units data file to load.
.It Fl q
Suppress prompting of the user for units and the display of statistics
about the number of units loaded.
.It Fl v
Print the version number.
.It Ar from-unit to-unit
Allow a single unit conversion to be done directly from the command
line.
The program will not print prompts.
It will print out the
result of the single specified conversion.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program converts quantities expressed in various scales to
their equivalents in other scales.
The
.Nm
program can only
handle multiplicative scale changes.
It cannot convert Celsius
to Fahrenheit, for example.
It works interactively by prompting
the user for input:
.Bd -literal
    You have: meters
    You want: feet
            * 3.2808399
            / 0.3048

    You have: cm^3
    You want: gallons
            * 0.00026417205
            / 3785.4118

    You have: meters/s
    You want: furlongs/fortnight
            * 6012.8848
            / 0.00016630952

    You have: 1|2 inch
    You want: cm
            * 1.27
            / 0.78740157
.Ed
.Pp
Powers of units can be specified using the '^' character as shown in
the example, or by simple concatenation: 'cm3' is equivalent to 'cm^3'.
Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, a dash or
an asterisk.
Division of units is indicated by the slash ('/').
Note that multiplication has a higher precedence than division,
so 'm/s/s' is the same as 'm/s^2' or 'm/s s'.
Division of numbers
must be indicated using the vertical bar ('|').
To convert half a
meter, you would write '1|2 meter'.
If you write '1/2 meter' then the
units program would interpret that as equivalent to '0.5/meter'.
If you enter incompatible unit types, the units program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
.Bd -literal
    You have: ergs/hour
    You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
    conformability error
            2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
            2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
.Ed
.Pp
The conversion information is read from a units data file.
The default
file includes definitions for most familiar units, abbreviations and
metric prefixes.
Some constants of nature included are:
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent -compact "mercury"
.It "pi	ratio of circumference to diameter
.It "c	speed of light
.It "e	charge on an electron
.It "g	acceleration of gravity
.It "force	same as g
.It "mole	Avogadro's number
.It "water	pressure per unit height of water
.It "mercury	pressure per unit height of mercury
.It "au	astronomical unit
.El
.Pp
The unit 'pound' is a unit of mass.
Compound names are run together
so 'pound force' is a unit of force.
The unit 'ounce' is also a unit
of mass.
The fluid ounce is 'floz'.
British units that differ from
their US counterparts are prefixed with 'br', and currency is prefixed
with its country name: 'belgiumfranc', 'britainpound'.
When searching
for a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit
name, then
.Nm
will try to remove a trailing 's' or a
trailing 'es' and check again for a match.
.Pp
To find out what units are available read the standard units file.
If you want to add your own units you can supply your own file.
A unit is specified on a single line by
giving its name and an equivalence.
Be careful to define
new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to the
primitive units which are marked with '!' characters.
The
.Nm
program will not detect infinite loops that could be caused
by careless unit definitions.
Comments in the unit definition file
begin with a '/' character at the beginning of a line.
.Pp
Prefixes are defined in the same was as standard units, but with
a trailing dash at the end of the prefix name.
If a unit is not found
even after removing trailing 's' or 'es', then it will be checked
against the list of prefixes.
Prefixes will be removed until a legal
base unit is identified.
.Pp
Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic
units.
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent -compact "minute"
.It "m	!a!

.Sh BUGS
The effect of including a '/' in a prefix is surprising.
.Pp
Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.
You can work around this by multiplying several terms.
.Pp
The user must use | to indicate division of numbers and / to
indicate division of symbols.
This distinction should not
be necessary.
.Pp
The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length
of the units converted and on the length of the data file.
.Pp
The program should use a hash table to store units so that
it does not take so long to load the units list and check

.SH NAME
unzip \- list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP archive
.PD
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunzip\fP [\fB\-Z\fP] [\fB\-cflptTuvz\fP[\fBabjnoqsCKLMVWX$/:\fP]]
\fIfile\fP[\fI.zip\fP] [\fIfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|.]
[\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|.] [\fB\-d\fP\ \fIexdir\fP]
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIunzip\fP will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive, commonly
found on MS-DOS systems.  The default behavior (with no options) is to extract
into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all files from the
specified ZIP archive.  A companion program, \fIzip\fP(1L), creates ZIP
archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by PKWARE's
\fIPKZIP\fP and \fIPKUNZIP\fP for MS-DOS, but in many cases the program
options or default behaviors differ.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR file [ .zip ]
Path of the ZIP archive(s).  If the file specification is a wildcard,
each matching file is processed in an order determined by the operating
system (or file system).  Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path
itself cannot.  Wildcard expressions are similar to those supported in
commonly used Unix shells (\fIsh\fP, \fIksh\fP, \fIcsh\fP) and may contain:
.RS
.IP *
matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
.IP ?
matches exactly 1 character
.IP [.\|.\|.]
matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified
by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation
point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the range of
characters within the brackets is complemented (that is, anything \fIexcept\fP
the characters inside the brackets is considered a match).  To specify a
verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence ``[[]'' has to be used.
.RE
.IP
(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.)  If no
matches are found, the specification is assumed to be a literal filename;
and if that also fails, the suffix \fC.zip\fR is appended.  Note that
self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive;
just specify the \fC.exe\fR suffix (if any) explicitly.
.IP [\fIfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.
(VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas
instead.  See \fB\-v\fP in \fBOPTIONS\fP below.)
Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members; see
above.  Again, be sure to quote expressions that would otherwise be expanded
or modified by the operating system.
.IP [\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.
Since wildcard characters normally match (`/') directory separators
(for exeptions see the option \fb\-W\fp\), this option may be used
to exclude any files that are in subdirectories.  For
example, ``\fCunzip foo *.[ch] -x */*\fR'' would extract all C source files
in the main directory, but none in any subdirectories.  Without the \fB\-x\fP
option, all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be
extracted.
.IP [\fB\-d\fP\ \fIexdir\fP]
An optional directory to which to extract files.  By default, all files
and subdirectories are recreated in the current directory; the \fB\-d\fP
option allows extraction in an arbitrary directory (always assuming one
has permission to write to the directory).  This option need not appear
at the end of the command line; it is also accepted before the zipfile
specification (with the normal options), immediately after the zipfile
specification, or between the \fIfile(s)\fP and the \fB\-x\fP option.
The option and directory may be concatenated without any white space
between them, but note that this may cause normal shell behavior to be
suppressed.  In particular, ``\fC\-d\ ~\fR'' (tilde) is expanded by Unix
C shells into the name of the user's home directory, but ``\fC\-d~\fR''
is treated as a literal subdirectory ``\fB~\fP'' of the current directory.
.\" =========================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
Note that, in order to support obsolescent hardware, \fIunzip\fP's usage
screen is limited to 22 or 23 lines and should therefore be considered
only a reminder of the basic \fIunzip\fP syntax rather than an exhaustive
list of all possible flags.  The exhaustive list follows:
.TP
.B \-Z
\fIzipinfo\fP(1L) mode.  If the first option on the command line is \fB\-Z\fP,
the remaining options are taken to be \fIzipinfo\fP(1L) options.  See the
appropriate manual page for a description of these options.
.TP
.B \-A
[OS/2, Unix DLL] print extended help for the DLL's programming interface (API).
.TP
.B \-c
extract files to stdout/screen (``CRT'').  This option is similar to the
\fB\-p\fP option except that the name of each file is printed as it is
extracted, the \fB\-a\fP option is allowed, and ASCII-EBCDIC conversion
is automatically performed if appropriate.  This option is not listed in
the \fIunzip\fP usage screen.
.TP
.B \-f
freshen existing files, i.e., extract only those files that
already exist on disk and that are newer than the disk copies.  By
default \fIunzip\fP queries before overwriting, but the \fB\-o\fP option
may be used to suppress the queries.  Note that under many operating systems,
the TZ (timezone) environment variable must be set correctly in order for
\fB\-f\fP and \fB\-u\fP to work properly (under Unix the variable is usually
set automatically).  The reasons for this are somewhat subtle but
have to do with the differences between DOS-format file times (always local
time) and Unix-format times (always in GMT/UTC) and the necessity to compare
the two.  A typical TZ value is ``PST8PDT'' (US Pacific time with automatic
adjustment for Daylight Savings Time or ``summer time'').
.TP
.B \-l
list archive files (short format).  The names, uncompressed file sizes and
modification dates and times of the specified files are printed, along
with totals for all files specified.  If UnZip was compiled with OS2_EAS
defined, the \fB\-l\fP option also lists columns for the sizes of stored
OS/2 extended attributes (EAs) and OS/2 access control lists (ACLs).  In
addition, the zipfile comment and individual file comments (if any) are
displayed.  If a file was archived from a single-case file system (for
example, the old MS-DOS FAT file system) and the \fB\-L\fP option was given,
the filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret (^).
.TP
.B \-p
extract files to pipe (stdout).  Nothing but the file data is sent to
stdout, and the files are always extracted in binary format, just as they
are stored (no conversions).
.TP
.B \-t
test archive files.  This option extracts each specified file in memory
and compares the CRC (cyclic redundancy check, an enhanced checksum) of
the expanded file with the original file's stored CRC value.
.TP
.B \-T
[most OSes] set the timestamp on the archive(s) to that of the newest file
in each one.  This corresponds to \fIzip\fP's \fB\-go\fP option except that
it can be used on wildcard zipfiles (e.g., ``\fCunzip \-T \e*.zip\fR'') and
is much faster.
.TP
.B \-u
update existing files and create new ones if needed.  This option performs
the same function as the \fB\-f\fP option, extracting (with query) files
that are newer than those with the same name on disk, and in addition it
extracts those files that do not already exist on disk.  See \fB\-f\fP
above for information on setting the timezone properly.
.TP
.B \-v
be verbose or print diagnostic version info.  This option has evolved and
now behaves as both an option and a modifier.  As an option it has two
purposes:  when a zipfile is specified with no other options, \fB\-v\fP lists
archive files verbosely, adding to the basic \fB\-l\fP info the compression
method, compressed size, compression ratio and 32-bit CRC.  In contrast to
most of the competing utilities, \fIunzip\fP removes the 12 additional header
bytes of encrypted entries from the compressed size numbers.  Therefore,
compressed size and compression ratio figures are independent of the entry's
encryption status and show the correct compression performance.  (The complete
size of the encryped compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reported
by the more verbose \fIzipinfo\fP(1L) reports, see the separate manual.)
When no zipfile is specified (that is, the complete command is simply
``\fCunzip \-v\fR''), a diagnostic screen is printed.  In addition to
the normal header with release date and version, \fIunzip\fP lists the
home Info-ZIP ftp site and where to find a list of other ftp and non-ftp
sites; the target operating system for which it was compiled, as well
as (possibly) the hardware on which it was compiled, the compiler and
version used, and the compilation date; any special compilation options
that might affect the program's operation (see also \fBDECRYPTION\fP below);
and any options stored in environment variables that might do the same
(see \fBENVIRONMENT OPTIONS\fP below).  As a modifier it works in
conjunction with other options (e.g., \fB\-t\fP) to produce more
verbose or debugging output; this is not yet fully implemented
but will be in future releases.
.TP
.B \-z
display only the archive comment.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH MODIFIERS
.TP
.B \-a
convert text files.  Ordinarily all files are extracted exactly as they
are stored (as ``binary'' files).  The \fB\-a\fP option causes files identified
by \fIzip\fP as text files (those with the `t' label in \fIzipinfo\fP
listings, rather than `b') to be automatically extracted as such, converting
line endings, end-of-file characters and the character set itself as necessary.
(For example, Unix files use line feeds (LFs) for end-of-line (EOL) and
have no end-of-file (EOF) marker; Macintoshes use carriage returns (CRs)
for EOLs; and most PC operating systems use CR+LF for EOLs and control-Z for
EOF.  In addition, IBM mainframes and the Michigan Terminal System use EBCDIC
rather than the more common ASCII character set, and NT supports Unicode.)
Note that \fIzip\fP's identification of text files is by no means perfect; some
``text'' files may actually be binary and vice versa.  \fIunzip\fP therefore
prints ``\fC[text]\fR'' or ``\fC[binary]\fR'' as a visual check for each file
it extracts when using the \fB\-a\fP option.  The \fB\-aa\fP option forces
all files to be extracted as text, regardless of the supposed file type.
.TP
.B \-b
[general] treat all files as binary (no text conversions).  This is a shortcut
for \fB\-\-\-a\fP.
.TP
.B \-b
[Tandem] force the creation files with filecode type 180 ('C') when
extracting Zip entries marked as "text". (On Tandem, \fB\-a\fP is enabled
by default, see above).
.TP
.B \-b
[VMS] auto-convert binary files (see \fB\-a\fP above) to fixed-length,
512-byte record format.  Doubling the option (\fB\-bb\fP) forces all files
to be extracted in this format. When extracting to standard output
(\fB\-c\fP or \fB\-p\fP option in effect), the default conversion of text
record delimiters is disabled for binary (\fB\-b\fP) resp. all (\fB\-bb\fP)
files.
.TP
.B \-B
[Unix only, and only if compiled with UNIXBACKUP defined] save a backup copy
of each overwritten file with a tilde appended (e.g., the old copy of
``\fCfoo\fR'' is renamed to ``\fCfoo~\fR'').  This is similar to the default
behavior of \fIemacs\fP(1) in many locations.
.TP
.B \-C
use case-insensitive matching for the selection of archive entries
from the command-line list of extract selection patterns.
\fIunzip\fP's philosophy is ``you get what you ask for'' (this is
also responsible for the \fB\-L\fP/\fB\-U\fP change; see the relevant
options below).  Because some file systems are fully case-sensitive
(notably those under the Unix operating system) and because
both ZIP archives and \fIunzip\fP itself are portable across platforms,
\fIunzip\fP's default behavior is to match both wildcard and literal
filenames case-sensitively.  That is, specifying ``\fCmakefile\fR''
on the command line will \fIonly\fP match ``makefile'' in the archive,
not ``Makefile'' or ``MAKEFILE'' (and similarly for wildcard specifications).
Since this does not correspond to the behavior of many other
operating/file systems (for example, OS/2 HPFS, which preserves
mixed case but is not sensitive to it), the \fB\-C\fP option may be
used to force all filename matches to be case-insensitive.  In the
example above, all three files would then match ``\fCmakefile\fR''
(or ``\fCmake*\fR'', or similar).  The \fB\-C\fP option affects
file specs in both the normal file list and the excluded-file list (xlist).
.IP
Please note that the \fB\-L\fP option does neither affect the search for
the zipfile(s) nor the matching of archive entries to existing files on
the extraction path.  On a case-sensitive file system, \fIunzip\fP will
never try to overwrite a file ``FOO'' when extracting an entry ``foo''!
.TP
.B \-E
[MacOS only] display contents of MacOS extra field during restore operation.
.TP
.B \-F
[Acorn only] suppress removal of NFS filetype extension from stored filenames.
.TP
.B \-F
[non-Acorn systems supporting long filenames with embedded commas,
and only if compiled with ACORN_FTYPE_NFS defined] translate
filetype information from ACORN RISC OS extra field blocks into a
NFS filetype extension and append it to the names of the extracted files.
(When the stored filename appears to already have an appended NFS filetype
extension, it is replaced by the info from the extra field.)
.TP
.B \-i
[MacOS only] ignore filenames stored in MacOS extra fields. Instead, the
most compatible filename stored in the generic part of the entry's header
is used.
.TP
.B \-j
junk paths.  The archive's directory structure is not recreated; all files
are deposited in the extraction directory (by default, the current one).
.TP
.B \-J
[BeOS only] junk file attributes.  The file's BeOS file attributes are not
restored, just the file's data.
.TP
.B \-J
[MacOS only] ignore MacOS extra fields.  All Macintosh specific info
is skipped. Data-fork and resource-fork are restored as separate files.
.TP
.B \-K
[AtheOS, BeOS, Unix only] retain SUID/SGID/Tacky file attributes.  Without
this flag, these attribute bits are cleared for security reasons.
.TP
.B \-L
convert to lowercase any filename originating on an uppercase-only operating
system or file system.  (This was \fIunzip\fP's default behavior in releases
prior to 5.11; the new default behavior is identical to the old behavior with
the \fB\-U\fP option, which is now obsolete and will be removed in a future
release.)  Depending on the archiver, files archived under single-case
file systems (VMS, old MS-DOS FAT, etc.) may be stored as all-uppercase names;
this can be ugly or inconvenient when extracting to a case-preserving
file system such as OS/2 HPFS or a case-sensitive one such as under
Unix.  By default \fIunzip\fP lists and extracts such filenames exactly as
they're stored (excepting truncation, conversion of unsupported characters,
etc.); this option causes the names of all files from certain systems to be
converted to lowercase.  The \fB\-LL\fP option forces conversion of every
filename to lowercase, regardless of the originating file system.
.TP
.B \-M
pipe all output through an internal pager similar to the Unix \fImore\fP(1)
command.  At the end of a screenful of output, \fIunzip\fP pauses with a
``\-\-More\-\-'' prompt; the next screenful may be viewed by pressing the
Enter (Return) key or the space bar.  \fIunzip\fP can be terminated by
pressing the ``q'' key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike
Unix \fImore\fP(1), there is no forward-searching or editing capability.
Also, \fIunzip\fP doesn't notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the screen,
effectively resulting in the printing of two or more lines and the likelihood
that some text will scroll off the top of the screen before being viewed.
On some systems the number of available lines on the screen is not detected,
in which case \fIunzip\fP assumes the height is 24 lines.
.TP
.B \-n
never overwrite existing files.  If a file already exists, skip the extraction
of that file without prompting.  By default \fIunzip\fP queries before
extracting any file that already exists; the user may choose to overwrite
only the current file, overwrite all files, skip extraction of the current
file, skip extraction of all existing files, or rename the current file.
.TP
.B \-N
[Amiga] extract file comments as Amiga filenotes.  File comments are created
with the \-c option of \fIzip\fP(1L), or with the \-N option of the Amiga port
of \fIzip\fP(1L), which stores filenotes as comments.
.TP
.B \-o
overwrite existing files without prompting.  This is a dangerous option, so
use it with care.  (It is often used with \fB\-f\fP, however, and is the only
way to overwrite directory EAs under OS/2.)
.IP \fB\-P\fP\ \fIpassword\fP
use \fIpassword\fP to decrypt encrypted zipfile entries (if any).  \fBTHIS IS
INSECURE!\fP  Many multi-user operating systems provide ways for any user to
see the current command line of any other user; even on stand-alone systems
there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext
password as part of a command line in an automated script is even worse.
Whenever possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.
(And where security is truly important, use strong encryption such as Pretty
Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak encryption provided by standard
zipfile utilities.)
.TP
.B \-q
perform operations quietly (\fB\-qq\fP = even quieter).  Ordinarily \fIunzip\fP
prints the names of the files it's extracting or testing, the extraction
methods, any file or zipfile comments that may be stored in the archive,
and possibly a summary when finished with each archive.  The \fB\-q\fP[\fBq\fP]
options suppress the printing of some or all of these messages.
.TP
.B \-s
[OS/2, NT, MS-DOS] convert spaces in filenames to underscores.  Since all PC
operating systems allow spaces in filenames, \fIunzip\fP by default extracts
filenames with spaces intact (e.g., ``\fCEA\ DATA.\ SF\fR'').  This can be
awkward, however, since MS-DOS in particular does not gracefully support
spaces in filenames.  Conversion of spaces to underscores can eliminate the
awkwardness in some cases.
.TP
.B \-U
(obsolete; to be removed in a future release) leave filenames uppercase if
created under MS-DOS, VMS, etc.  See \fB\-L\fP above.
.TP
.B \-V
retain (VMS) file version numbers.  VMS files can be stored with a version
number, in the format \fCfile.ext;##\fR.  By default the ``\fC;##\fR'' version
numbers are stripped, but this option allows them to be retained.  (On
file systems that limit filenames to particularly short lengths, the version
numbers may be truncated or stripped regardless of this option.)
.TP
.B \-W
[only when WILD_STOP_AT_DIR compile-time option enabled]
modifies the pattern matching routine so that both `?' (single-char wildcard)
and `*' (multi-char wildcard) do not match the directory separator character
`/'.  (The two-character sequence ``**'' acts as a multi-char wildcard that
includes the directory separator in its matched characters.)  Examples:
.PP
.EX
    "*.c" matches "foo.c" but not "mydir/foo.c"
    "**.c" matches both "foo.c" and "mydir/foo.c"
    "*/*.c" matches "bar/foo.c" but not "baz/bar/foo.c"
    "??*/*" matches "ab/foo" and "abc/foo"
            but not "a/foo" or "a/b/foo"
.EE
.IP
This modified behaviour is equivalent to the pattern matching style
used by the shells of some of UnZip's supported target OSs (one
example is Acorn RISC OS).  This option may not be available on systems
where the Zip archive's interal directory separator character `/' is
allowed as regular character in native operating system filenames.
(Currently, UnZip uses the same pattern matching rules for both wildcard
zipfile specifications and zip entry selection patterns in most ports.
For systems allowing `/' as regular filename character, the -W option
would not work as expected on a wildcard zipfile specification.)
.TP
.B \-X
[VMS, Unix, OS/2, NT] restore owner/protection info (UICs) under VMS, or user
and group info (UID/GID) under Unix, or access control lists (ACLs) under
certain network-enabled versions of OS/2 (Warp Server with IBM LAN
Server/Requester 3.0 to 5.0; Warp Connect with IBM Peer 1.0), or security ACLs
under Windows NT.  In most cases this will require special system privileges,
and doubling the option (\fB\-XX\fP) under NT instructs \fIunzip\fP to use
privileges for extraction; but under Unix, for example, a user who belongs to
several groups can restore files owned by any of those groups, as long as the
user IDs match his or her own.  Note that ordinary file attributes are always
restored--this option applies only to optional, extra ownership info available
on some operating systems.  [NT's access control lists do not appear to be
especially compatible with OS/2's, so no attempt is made at cross-platform
portability of access privileges.  It is not clear under what conditions this
would ever be useful anyway.]
.TP
.B \-$
.\" Amiga support possible eventually, but not yet
[MS-DOS, OS/2, NT] restore the volume label if the extraction medium is
removable (e.g., a diskette).  Doubling the option (\fB\-$$\fP) allows fixed
media (hard disks) to be labelled as well.  By default, volume labels are
ignored.
.IP \fB\-/\fP\ \fIextensions\fP
[Acorn only] overrides the extension list supplied by Unzip$Ext environment
variable. During extraction, filename extensions that match one of the items
in this extension list are swapped in front of the base name of the extracted
file.
.TP
.B \-:
[all but Acorn, VM/CMS, MVS, Tandem] allows to extract archive members into
locations outside of the current `` extraction root folder''. For security
reasons, \fIunzip\fP normally removes ``parent dir'' path components
(``../'') from the names of extracted file.  This safety feature (new for
version 5.50) prevents \fIunzip\fP from accidentally writing files to
``sensitive'' areas outside the active extraction folder tree head.  The
\fB\-:\fP option lets \fIunzip\fP switch back to its previous, more liberal
behaviour, to allow exact extraction of (older) archives that used ``../''
components to create multiple directory trees at the level of the current
extraction folder.  This option does not enable writing explicitly to the
root directory (``/'').  To achieve this, it is necessary to set the
extraction target folder to root (e.g. \fB\-d / \fP).  However, when the
\fB\-:\fP option is specified, it is still possible to implicitly write to
the root directory by specifiying enough ``../'' path components within the
zip archive.
Use this option with extreme caution.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
\fIunzip\fP's default behavior may be modified via options placed in
an environment variable.  This can be done with any option, but it
is probably most useful with the \fB\-a\fP, \fB\-L\fP, \fB\-C\fP, \fB\-q\fP,
\fB\-o\fP, or \fB\-n\fP modifiers:  make \fIunzip\fP auto-convert text
files by default, make it convert filenames from uppercase systems to
lowercase, make it match names case-insensitively, make it quieter,
or make it always overwrite or never overwrite files as it extracts
them.  For example, to make \fIunzip\fP act as quietly as possible, only
reporting errors, one would use one of the following commands:
.TP
  Unix Bourne shell:
UNZIP=\-qq; export UNZIP
.TP
  Unix C shell:
setenv UNZIP \-qq
.TP
  OS/2 or MS-DOS:
set UNZIP=\-qq
.TP
  VMS (quotes for \fIlowercase\fP):
define UNZIP_OPTS ""\-qq""
.PP
Environment options are, in effect, considered to be just like any other
command-line options, except that they are effectively the first options
on the command line.  To override an environment option, one may use the
``minus operator'' to remove it.  For instance, to override one of the
quiet-flags in the example above, use the command
.PP
.EX
unzip \-\-q[\fIother options\fP] zipfile
.EE
.PP
The first hyphen is the normal
switch character, and the second is a minus sign, acting on the q option.
Thus the effect here is to cancel one quantum of quietness.  To cancel
both quiet flags, two (or more) minuses may be used:
.PP
.EX
unzip \-t\-\-q zipfile
unzip \-\-\-qt zipfile
.EE
.PP
(the two are equivalent).  This may seem awkward
or confusing, but it is reasonably intuitive:  just ignore the first
hyphen and go from there.  It is also consistent with the behavior of
Unix \fInice\fP(1).
.PP
As suggested by the examples above, the default variable names are UNZIP_OPTS
for VMS (where the symbol used to install \fIunzip\fP as a foreign command
would otherwise be confused with the environment variable), and UNZIP
for all other operating systems.  For compatibility with \fIzip\fP(1L),
UNZIPOPT is also accepted (don't ask).  If both UNZIP and UNZIPOPT
are defined, however, UNZIP takes precedence.  \fIunzip\fP's diagnostic
option (\fB\-v\fP with no zipfile name) can be used to check the values
of all four possible \fIunzip\fP and \fIzipinfo\fP environment variables.
.PP
The timezone variable (TZ) should be set according to the local timezone
in order for the \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-u\fP to operate correctly.  See the
description of \fB\-f\fP above for details.  This variable may also be
necessary to get timestamps of extracted files to be set correctly.
The WIN32 (Win9x/ME/NT4/2K/XP/2K3) port of \fIunzip\fP gets the timezone
configuration from the registry, assuming it is correctly set in the
Control Panel.  The TZ variable is ignored for this port.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH DECRYPTION
Encrypted archives are fully supported by Info-ZIP software, but due to
United States export restrictions, de-/encryption support might be disabled
in your compiled binary.  However, since spring 2000, US export restrictions
have been liberated, and our source archives do now include full crypt code.
In case you need binary distributions with crypt support enabled, see the
file ``WHERE'' in any Info-ZIP source or binary distribution for locations
both inside and outside the US.
.PP
Some compiled versions of \fIunzip\fP may not support decryption.
To check a version for crypt support, either attempt to test or extract
an encrypted archive, or else check \fIunzip\fP's diagnostic
screen (see the \fB\-v\fP option above) for ``\fC[decryption]\fR'' as one
of the special compilation options.
.PP
As noted above, the \fB\-P\fP option may be used to supply a password on
the command line, but at a cost in security.  The preferred decryption
method is simply to extract normally; if a zipfile member is encrypted,
\fIunzip\fP will prompt for the password without echoing what is typed.
\fIunzip\fP continues to use the same password as long as it appears to be
valid, by testing a 12-byte header on each file.  The correct password will
always check out against the header, but there is a 1-in-256 chance that an
incorrect password will as well.  (This is a security feature of the PKWARE
zipfile format; it helps prevent brute-force attacks that might otherwise
gain a large speed advantage by testing only the header.)  In the case that
an incorrect password is given but it passes the header test anyway, either
an incorrect CRC will be generated for the extracted data or else \fIunzip\fP
will fail during the extraction because the ``decrypted'' bytes do not
constitute a valid compressed data stream.
.PP
If the first password fails the header check on some file, \fIunzip\fP will
prompt for another password, and so on until all files are extracted.  If
a password is not known, entering a null password (that is, just a carriage
return or ``Enter'') is taken as a signal to skip all further prompting.
Only unencrypted files in the archive(s) will thereafter be extracted.  (In
fact, that's not quite true; older versions of \fIzip\fP(1L) and
\fIzipcloak\fP(1L) allowed null passwords, so \fIunzip\fP checks each encrypted
file to see if the null password works.  This may result in ``false positives''
and extraction errors, as noted above.)
.PP
Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (for example, passwords with accented
European characters) may not be portable across systems and/or other
archivers.  This problem stems from the use of multiple encoding methods for
such characters, including Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) and OEM code page 850.  DOS
\fIPKZIP\fP 2.04g uses the OEM code page; Windows \fIPKZIP\fP 2.50 uses
Latin-1 (and is therefore incompatible with DOS \fIPKZIP\fP); Info-ZIP uses
the OEM code page on DOS, OS/2 and Win3.x ports but Latin-1 everywhere
else; and Nico Mak's \fIWinZip\fP 6.x does not allow 8-bit passwords at all.
\fIUnZip\fP 5.3 (or newer) attempts to use the default character set first
(e.g., Latin-1), followed by the alternate one (e.g., OEM code page) to test
passwords.  On EBCDIC systems, if both of these fail, EBCDIC encoding will
be tested as a last resort.  (EBCDIC is not tested on non-EBCDIC systems,
because there are no known archivers that encrypt using EBCDIC encoding.)
ISO character encodings other than Latin-1 are not supported.

.SH TIPS
The current maintainer, being a lazy sort, finds it very useful to define
a pair of aliases:  \fCtt\fR for ``\fCunzip \-tq\fR'' and \fCii\fR for
``\fCunzip \-Z\fR'' (or ``\fCzipinfo\fR'').  One may then simply type
``\fCtt zipfile\fR'' to test an archive, something that is worth making a
habit of doing.  With luck \fIunzip\fP will report ``\fCNo errors detected
in compressed data of zipfile.zip\fR,'' after which one may breathe a sigh
of relief.
.PP
The maintainer also finds it useful to set the UNZIP environment variable
to ``\fC\-aL\fR'' and is tempted to add ``\fC\-C\fR'' as well.  His ZIPINFO
variable is set to ``\fC\-z\fR''.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes defined by PKWARE
and takes on the following values, except under VMS:
.RS
.IP 0
normal; no errors or warnings detected.
.IP 1
one or more warning errors were encountered, but processing completed
successfully anyway.  This includes zipfiles where one or more files
was skipped due to unsupported compression method or encryption with an
unknown password.
.IP 2
a generic error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing may have
completed successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
archivers have simple work-arounds.
.IP 3
a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably
failed immediately.
.IP 4
\fIunzip\fP was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during
program initialization.
.IP 5
\fIunzip\fP was unable to allocate memory or unable to obtain a tty to read
the decryption password(s).
.IP 6
\fIunzip\fP was unable to allocate memory during decompression to disk.
.IP 7
\fIunzip\fP was unable to allocate memory during in-memory decompression.
.IP 8
[currently not used]
.IP 9
the specified zipfiles were not found.
.IP 10
invalid options were specified on the command line.
.IP 11
no matching files were found.
.IP 50
the disk is (or was) full during extraction.
.IP 51
the end of the ZIP archive was encountered prematurely.
.IP 80
the user aborted \fIunzip\fP prematurely with control-C (or similar)
.IP 81
testing or extraction of one or more files failed due to unsupported
compression methods or unsupported decryption.
.IP 82
no files were found due to bad decryption password(s).  (If even one file is
successfully processed, however, the exit status is 1.)
.RE
.PP
VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking
things, so \fIunzip\fP instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  The
current mapping is as follows:   1 (success) for normal exit, 0x7fff0001
for warning errors, and (0x7fff000? + 16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all
other errors, where the `?' is 2 (error) for \fIunzip\fP values 2, 9-11 and
80-82, and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining ones (3-8, 50, 51).  In addition,
there is a compilation option to expand upon this behavior:  defining
RETURN_CODES results in a human-readable explanation of what the error
status means.

.SH BUGS
Multi-part archives are not yet supported, except in conjunction with
\fIzip\fP.  (All parts must be concatenated together in order, and then
``\fCzip \-F\fR'' must be performed on the concatenated archive in order
to ``fix'' it.)  This will definitely be corrected in the next major release.
.PP
Archives read from standard input are not yet supported, except with
\fIfunzip\fP (and then only the first member of the archive can be extracted).
.PP
Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (e.g., passwords with accented
European characters) may not be portable across systems and/or other
archivers.  See the discussion in \fBDECRYPTION\fP above.
.PP
\fIunzip\fP's \fB\-M\fP (``more'') option tries to take into account automatic
wrapping of long lines. However, the code may fail to detect the correct
wrapping locations. First, TAB characters (and similar control sequences) are
not taken into account, they are handled as ordinary printable characters.
Second, depending on the actual system / OS port, \fIunzip\fP may not detect
the true screen geometry but rather rely on "commonly used" default dimensions.
The correct handling of tabs would require the implementation of a query for
the actual tabulator setup on the output console.
.PP
Dates, times and permissions of stored directories are not restored except
under Unix. (On Windows NT and successors, timestamps are now restored.)
.PP
[MS-DOS] When extracting or testing files from an archive on a defective
floppy diskette, if the ``Fail'' option is chosen from DOS's ``Abort, Retry,
Fail?'' message, older versions of \fIunzip\fP may hang the system, requiring
a reboot.  This problem appears to be fixed, but control-C (or control-Break)
can still be used to terminate \fIunzip\fP.
.PP
Under DEC Ultrix, \fIunzip\fP would sometimes fail on long zipfiles (bad CRC,
not always reproducible).  This was apparently due either to a hardware bug
(cache memory) or an operating system bug (improper handling of page faults?).
Since Ultrix has been abandoned in favor of Digital Unix (OSF/1), this may not
be an issue anymore.
.PP
[Unix] Unix special files such as FIFO buffers (named pipes), block devices
and character devices are not restored even if they are somehow represented
in the zipfile, nor are hard-linked files relinked.  Basically the only file
types restored by \fIunzip\fP are regular files, directories and symbolic
(soft) links.
.PP
[OS/2] Extended attributes for existing directories are only updated if the
\fB\-o\fP (``overwrite all'') option is given.  This is a limitation of the
operating system; because directories only have a creation time associated
with them, \fIunzip\fP has no way to determine whether the stored attributes
are newer or older than those on disk.  In practice this may mean a two-pass
approach is required:  first unpack the archive normally (with or without
freshening/updating existing files), then overwrite just the directory entries
(e.g., ``\fCunzip -o foo */\fR'').
.PP
[VMS] When extracting to another directory, only the \fI[.foo]\fP syntax is
accepted for the \fB\-d\fP option; the simple Unix \fIfoo\fP syntax is
silently ignored (as is the less common VMS \fIfoo.dir\fP syntax).
.PP
[VMS] When the file being extracted already exists, \fIunzip\fP's query only
allows skipping, overwriting or renaming; there should additionally be a
choice for creating a new version of the file.  In fact, the ``overwrite''
choice does create a new version; the old version is not overwritten or
deleted.

.SH NAME
unzipsfx \- self-extracting stub for prepending to ZIP archives
.PD
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB<name of unzipsfx+archive combo>\fP [\fB\-cfptuz\fP[\fBajnoqsCLV$\fP]]
[\fIfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|. [\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|.]]
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIunzipsfx\fP is a modified version of \fIunzip\fP(1L) designed to be
prepended to existing ZIP archives in order to form self-extracting archives.
Instead of taking its first non-flag argument to be the zipfile(s) to be
extracted, \fIunzipsfx\fP seeks itself under the name by which it was invoked
and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive.  Because the
executable stub adds bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to
be as small as possible), a number of the less-vital capabilities in regular
\fIunzip\fP have been removed.  Among these are the usage (or help) screen,
the listing and diagnostic functions (\fB\-l\fP and \fB\-v\fP), the ability
to decompress older compression formats (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink'' and
``implode'' methods).  The ability to extract to a directory other than
the current one can be selected as a compile-time option, which is now enabled
by default since UnZipSFX version 5.5.  Similary, decryption is supported as
a compile-time option but should be avoided unless the attached archive
contains encrypted files. Starting with release 5.5, another compile-time
option adds a simple ``run command after extraction'' feature.  This feature
is currently incompatible with the ``extract to different directory''
feature and remains disabled by default.
.PP
\fBNote that
self-extracting archives made with\fP \fIunzipsfx\fP \fBare no more (or less)
portable across different operating systems than is
the\fP \fIunzip\fP \fBexecutable itself.\fP  In general a self-extracting
archive made on
a particular Unix system, for example, will only self-extract under the same
flavor of Unix.  Regular \fIunzip\fP may still be used to extract the
embedded archive as with any normal zipfile, although it will generate
a harmless warning about extra bytes at the beginning of the zipfile.
\fIDespite this\fP, however, the self-extracting archive is technically
\fInot\fP a valid ZIP archive, and PKUNZIP may be unable to test or extract
it.  This limitation is due to the simplistic manner in which the archive
is created; the internal directory structure is not updated to reflect the
extra bytes prepended to the original zipfile.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP [\fIfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be processed.
Regular expressions (wildcards) similar to those in Unix \fIegrep\fP(1)
may be used to match multiple members.  These wildcards may contain:
.RS
.IP *
matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
.IP ?
matches exactly 1 character
.IP [.\|.\|.]
matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified
by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation
point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the range of
characters within the brackets is complemented (that is, anything \fIexcept\fP
the characters inside the brackets is considered a match).
.RE
.IP
(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.)
.IP [\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.
Since wildcard characters match directory separators (`/'), this option
may be used to exclude any files that are in subdirectories.  For
example, ``\fCfoosfx *.[ch] -x */*\fR'' would extract all C source files
in the main directory, but none in any subdirectories.  Without the \fB\-x\fP
option, all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be
extracted.
.PP
If \fIunzipsfx\fP is compiled with SFX_EXDIR defined, the following option
is also enabled:
.IP [\fB\-d\fP\ \fIexdir\fP]
An optional directory to which to extract files.  By default, all files
and subdirectories are recreated in the current directory; the \fB\-d\fP
option allows extraction in an arbitrary directory (always assuming one
has permission to write to the directory).  The option and directory may
be concatenated without any white space between them, but note that this
may cause normal shell behavior to be suppressed.  In particular,
``\fC\-d\ ~\fR'' (tilde) is expanded by Unix C shells into the name
of the user's home directory, but ``\fC\-d~\fR'' is treated as a
literal subdirectory ``\fB~\fP'' of the current directory.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
\fIunzipsfx\fP supports the following \fIunzip\fP(1L) options:  \fB\-c\fP
and \fB\-p\fP (extract to standard output/screen), \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-u\fP
(freshen and update existing files upon extraction), \fB\-t\fP (test
archive) and \fB\-z\fP (print archive comment).  All normal listing options
(\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-v\fP and \fB\-Z\fP) have been removed, but the testing
option (\fB\-t\fP) may be used as a ``poor man's'' listing.  Alternatively,
those creating self-extracting archives may wish to include a short listing
in the zipfile comment.
.PP
See \fIunzip\fP(1L) for a more complete description of these options.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH MODIFIERS
\fIunzipsfx\fP currently supports all \fIunzip\fP(1L) modifiers:  \fB\-a\fP
(convert text files), \fB\-n\fP (never overwrite), \fB\-o\fP (overwrite
without prompting), \fB\-q\fP (operate quietly), \fB\-C\fP (match names
case-insensitively), \fB\-L\fP (convert uppercase-OS names to lowercase),
\fB\-j\fP (junk paths) and \fB\-V\fP (retain version numbers); plus the
following operating-system specific options:  \fB\-X\fP (restore VMS
owner/protection info), \fB\-s\fP (convert spaces in filenames to underscores
[DOS, OS/2, NT]) and \fB\-$\fP (restore volume label [DOS, OS/2, NT, Amiga]).
.PP
(Support for regular ASCII text-conversion may be removed in future versions,
since it is simple enough for the archive's creator to ensure that text
files have the appropriate format for the local OS.  EBCDIC conversion will
of course continue to be supported since the zipfile format implies ASCII
storage of text files.)
.PP
See \fIunzip\fP(1L) for a more complete description of these modifiers.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
\fIunzipsfx\fP uses the same environment variables as \fIunzip\fP(1L) does,
although this is likely to be an issue only for the person creating and
testing the self-extracting archive.  See \fIunzip\fP(1L) for details.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH DECRYPTION
Decryption is supported exactly as in \fIunzip\fP(1L); that is, interactively
with a non-echoing prompt for the password(s).  See \fIunzip\fP(1L) for
details.  Once again, note that if the archive has no encrypted files there
is no reason to use a version of \fIunzipsfx\fP with decryption support;
that only adds to the size of the archive.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH AUTORUN COMMAND
When \fIunzipsfx\fP was compiled with CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined, a simple
``command autorun'' feature is supported. You may enter a command into the
Zip archive comment, using the following format:
.PP
.EX
$AUTORUN$>[command line string]
.EE
.PP
When \fIunzipsfx\P recognizes the ``$AUTORUN$>'' token at the beginning
of the Zip archive comment, the remainder of the first line of the comment
(until the first newline character) is passed as a shell command to the
operating system using the C rtl ``system'' function. Before executing
the command, \fIunzipsfx\P displays the command on the console and prompts
the user for confirmation.  When the user has switched off prompting by
specifying the \fB-q\fP option, autorun commands are never executed.
.PP
In case the archive comment contains additonal lines of text, the remainder
of the archive comment following the first line is displayed normally, unless
quiet operation was requested by supplying a \fB-q\fP option.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================

.\" =========================================================================
.SH LIMITATIONS
The principle and fundamental limitation of \fIunzipsfx\fP is that it is
not portable across architectures or operating systems, and therefore
neither are the resulting archives.  For some architectures there is
limited portability, however (e.g., between some flavors of Intel-based Unix).
.PP
Another problem with the current implementation is that any archive
with ``junk'' prepended to the beginning technically is no longer a zipfile
(unless \fIzip\fP(1) is used to adjust the zipfile offsets appropriately,
as noted above).  \fIunzip\fP(1) takes note of the prepended bytes
and ignores them since some file-transfer protocols, notably MacBinary, are
also known to prepend junk.  But PKWARE's archiver suite may not be able to
deal with the modified archive unless its offsets have been adjusted.
.PP
\fIunzipsfx\fP has no knowledge of the user's PATH, so in general an archive
must either be in the current directory when it is invoked, or else a full
or relative path must be given.  If a user attempts to extract the archive
from a directory in the PATH other than the current one, \fIunzipsfx\fP will
print a warning to the effect, ``can't find myself.''  This is always true
under Unix and may be true in some cases under MS-DOS, depending on the
compiler used (Microsoft C fully qualifies the program name, but other
compilers may not).  Under OS/2 and NT there are operating-system calls
available that provide the full path name, so the archive may be invoked
from anywhere in the user's path.  The situation is not known for AmigaDOS,
Atari TOS, MacOS, etc.
.PP
As noted above, a number of the normal \fIunzip\fP(1L) functions have
been removed in order to make \fIunzipsfx\fP smaller:  usage and diagnostic
info, listing functions and extraction to other directories.  Also, only
stored and deflated files are supported.  The latter limitation is mainly
relevant to those who create SFX archives, however.
.PP
VMS users must know how to set up self-extracting archives as foreign
commands in order to use any of \fIunzipsfx\fP's options.  This is not
necessary for simple extraction, but the command to do so then becomes,
e.g., ``\fCrun letters\fR'' (to continue the examples given above).
.PP
\fIunzipsfx\fP on the Amiga requires the use of a special program, MakeSFX,
in order to create working self-extracting archives; simple concatenation
does not work.  (For technically oriented users, the attached archive is
defined as a ``debug hunk.'')  There may be compatibility problems between
the ROM levels of older Amigas and newer ones.
.PP
All current bugs in \fIunzip\fP(1L) exist in \fIunzipsfx\fP as well.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl root Ar directory 
.Op Fl overlay Ar directory 
.Op Fl arch Ar arch 
.Op Fl force 
.Op Fl debug
.Op Fl sort_by_name 
.Op Fl universal_boot

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache
ensures that dyld's shared cache is up-to-date.  This tool is normally
only run by Apple's Installer and Software Update, as they are the only
official ways for OS dylibs to be updated.  But if for some reason you
used another mechanism to alter an OS dylib, you should manually run
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache . 
.Pp
Note that the new cache does not take effect until the OS is rebooted.  
.Pp
If a safe-boot is
done (booting with shift key held down) the cache is deleted.  
.Pp
The dyld shared cache
is mapped by dyld into a process at launch time. Later, when loading
any mach-o image, dyld will first check if is in the share cache, and if
it is will use that pre-bound version instead of opening, mapping, and binding
the original file.  This results in significant performance improvements to
launch time.
.Pp
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache
scans the directory /var/db/dyld/shared_region_roots for text files containing paths to
mach-o executables.  The full dependencies of all dylibs required by those executables is
used to determine which libraries are commonly used and should be placed in the
shared cache. If one of the text files contains a path to a dylib, that dylib and its
dependents will be forced into the cache.
.Pp
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache
builds a separate cache file for each architecture.  The cache files and a readable text
map of the cached are generated to /var/db/dyld.
.Pp
You must be root to run this tool.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag
.It Fl root Ar directory
This option specifies the root of an OS installation for which dyld's
shared cache should be updated.  This is used by the Installer to update the
dyld shared cache in a partition other than the one you into which you are currently 
booted.  The cache files are created in the var/db/dyld directory of the specified directory.
Note: if you are manually doing this, be sure to run the update_dyld_shared_cache tool
that is in the partition being updated.  This assures the cache format created will
match that expected when booting off that partition. 
.It Fl overlay Ar directory
This option specifies the root of a sparse directory tree.  When building
the dyld shared cache, any corresponding mach-o files in the sparse directory 
will override those in the boot partition.  This is used by Software
Update to build a dyld shared cache for the update that is about to be
installed.  The cache files
are created in the var/db/dyld directory of the specified directory.
.It Fl arch Ar arch
By default 
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache 
generates cache files for all architecture that the current machine
can execute.  You can override this behavior by specifying one or more -arch options and list
exactly which architectures should have their shared caches updated.
.It Fl force
This option will cause 
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache
to regenerated the shared cache files even if they appear to be already up-to-date. 
.It Fl debug
This option prints out additional information about the work being done.
.It Fl sort_by_name
By default
.Nm update_dyld_shared_cache
assigns a random start address to each mach-o image in the cache.
This option causes the start addresses to be chosen in path order, thus subsequent runs will
produce the same address layout which can help reproduce some bugs.
.It Fl universal_boot
This option can only be used running on an machine with an Intel processor.  It builds caches
that can be used when booting on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.
.It Fl dylib_list Ar file
Instead of scanning /var/db/dyld/shared_region_roots/, this option provides a file that contains
a list of the dylibs to use when building the shared cache file.
.It Fl verify
Will regenerate a shared cache in-memory that matches the randomization of the existing shared 
cache file.  Then instead of writing the cache file, it compares the in-memory cache file to
the on disk version and reports any differences.  
.It Fl iPhone
indicates that cache is not for the current Mac OS X, but for rather for an iPhone
.It Fl cache_dir Ar directory
This option specifies the directory in which to create the cache file(s).  If not specified,
the cache file(s) are created in the standard location (e.g. var/db/dyld/) of the root partition.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Tp

.SH NAME
uuconv \- convert UUCP configuration files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uuconv
-i type -o type [-p program] [--program program]
.PP
.B uuconv
--input type --output type [-p program] [--program program]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uuconv
program can be used to convert UUCP configuration
files from one format to another.  This can be useful
for administrators converting from an older UUCP package.
Taylor UUCP is able to read and use old configuration file
formats, but some new features can not be selected using
the old formats.
.PP
The type of configuration file to read is specified using the
.B -i
or
.B \-\-input
options.  
The type of  configuration file to write is specified using the
.B -o
or
.B \-\-output
options.
.PP
The supported configuration file types are 
.I taylor,
.I v2,
and  
.I hdb.
For a description of the 
.I taylor
configuration files, use the
.B info
command and see "*Note Configuration Files::" for uucp.
The other types of configuration files are used by traditional UUCP
packages, and are not described in this manual.
.PP
An input configuration of type  
.I taylor
is read  from  a compiled in directory by default.
.PP
The output configuration is written to files in the directory
in which 
.B uuconv
is run.
.PP
Some information in the input files may not be representable
in the desired output format, in which case 
.B uuconv 
will silently discard it.
The output of uuconv should be carefully checked before it is used. 
The uuchk(8) program may be used for this purpose.
.PP
The 
.B -p
or
.B \-\-program
option may be used to convert specific 
.I cu
configuration information,  
rather than the default of only converting the 
.I uucp
configuration information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -i, \-\-input
Set input type (one of taylor, v2, hdb)
.TP 5
.B -o, \-\-output
Set output type (one of taylor, v2, hdb)
.TP 5
.B -p, \-\-program
Program to convert (e.g., uucp or cu)
.TP 5
.PP
Standard UUCP options:
.B \-v, \-\-version
Report version information and exit.
.TP 5
.B \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.

.TH uucp 1 "Taylor UUCP 1.07"
.SH NAME
uucp \- Unix to Unix copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uucp
[ options ] source-file destination-file
.PP
.B uucp
[ options ] source-file... destination-directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I uucp
command copies files between systems.  Each
.I file
argument is either a pathname on the local machine or is of the form
.IP
system!path
.LP
which is interpreted as being on a remote system.
In the first form, the contents of the first file are copied to the
second.  In the second form, each source file is copied into the
destination directory.

A file be transferred to or from
.I system2
via
.I system1
by using
.IP
system1!system2!path.
.LP

Any pathname that does not begin with / or ~ will be appended to the
current directory (unless the
.B \-W
or
.B \--noexpand
option is used); this resulting path will not necessarily exist on a
remote system.  A pathname beginning with a simple ~ starts at the
UUCP public directory; a pathname beginning with ~name starts at the
home directory of the named user.  The ~ is interpreted on the
appropriate system.  Note that some shells will interpret a simple ~
to the local home directory before
.I uucp
sees it; to avoid this the ~ must be quoted.

Shell metacharacters ? * [ ] are interpreted on the appropriate
system, assuming they are quoted to prevent the shell from
interpreting them first.

The copy does not take place immediately, but is queued up for the
.I uucico
(8) daemon; the daemon is started immediately unless the 
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-nouucico
switch is given.  In any case, the next time the remote system is called the
file(s) will be copied.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be given to
.I uucp.
.TP 5
.B \-c, \-\-nocopy
Do not copy local source files to the spool directory.  If they are
removed before being processed by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files must be readable by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon, and by the invoking user.
.TP 5
.B \-C, \-\-copy
Copy local source files to the spool directory.  This is the default.
.TP 5
.B \-d, \-\-directories
Create all necessary directories when doing the copy.  This is the
default.
.TP 5
.B \-f, \-\-nodirectories
If any necessary directories do not exist for the destination path,
abort the copy.
.TP 5
.B \-R, \-\-recursive
If any of the source file names are directories, copy their contents
recursively to the destination (which must itself be a directory).
.TP 5
.B \-g grade, \-\-grade grade
Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade
are executed first.  Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to
low.
.TP 5
.B \-m, \-\-mail
Report completion or failure of the file transfer by
.I mail
(1).
.TP 5
.B \-n user, \-\-notify user
Report completion or failure of the file transfer by
.I mail
(1) to the named
user on the remote system.
.TP 5
.B \-r, \-\-nouucico
Do not start
.I uucico
(8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the file transfer for later
execution.
.TP 5
.B \-j, \-\-jobid
Print jobid on standard output.  The job may be
later cancelled by passing the jobid to the
.B \-k
switch of
.I uustat
(1).
It is possible for some complex operations to produce more than one
jobid, in which case each will be printed on a separate line.  For
example
.br
.in +0.5i
.nf
uucp sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 ~user3
.fi
.in -0.5i
will generate two separate jobs, one for the system
.I sys1
and one for the system
.I sys2.
.TP 5
.B \-W, \-\-noexpand
Do not prepend remote relative path names with the current directory.
.TP 5
.B \-t, \-\-uuto
This option is used by the 
.I uuto
shell script.  It causes
.I uucp
to interpret the final argument as
.I system!user.
The file(s) are sent to
.I ~/receive/USER/LOCAL
on the remote system, where
.I USER
is from the final argument and
.I LOCAL
is the local UUCP
system name.  Also,
.I uucp
will act as though
.I \-\-notify user
were specified.
.TP 5
.B \-x type, \-\-debug type
Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,
spooldir and execute are meaningful for
.I uucp.

Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the
.B \-\-debug
option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
.B \-\-debug 2
is equivalent to
.B \-\-debug abnormal,chat.
.TP 5
.B \-I file, \-\-config file
Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
depending upon how
.I uucp
was compiled.
.TP 5
.B \-v, \-\-version
Report version information and exit.
.TP 5
.B \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.SH SEE ALSO
mail(1), uux(1), uustat(1), uucico(8)
.SH BUGS
Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the
.I uucico
(8) daemon on the remote system.

The 
.I \-n
and
.I \-m
switches do not work when transferring a file from one remote system
to another.

File modes are not preserved, except for the execute bit.  The
resulting file is owned by the uucp user.

.Sh NAME
.Nm uudecode ,
.Nm uuencode
.Nd encode/decode a binary file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm uuencode
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl o Ar output_file
.Op Ar file
.Ar name
.Nm uudecode
.Op Fl cips
.Op Ar
.Nm uudecode
.Op Fl i
.Fl o Ar output_file
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm uuencode
and
.Nm uudecode
utilities are used to transmit binary files over transmission mediums
that do not support other than simple
.Tn ASCII
data.
.Pp
The
.Nm uuencode
utility reads
.Ar file
(or by default the standard input) and writes an encoded version
to the standard output, or
.Ar output_file
if one has been specified.
The encoding uses only printing
.Tn ASCII
characters and includes the
mode of the file and the operand
.Ar name
for use by
.Nm uudecode .
.Pp
The
.Nm uudecode
utility transforms
.Em uuencoded
files (or by default, the standard input) into the original form.
The resulting file is named either
.Ar name
or (depending on options passed to
.Nm uudecode )
.Ar output_file
and will have the mode of the original file except that setuid
and execute bits are not retained.
The
.Nm uudecode
utility ignores any leading and trailing lines.
.Pp
The following options are available for
.Nm uuencode :
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Fl m
Use the Base64 method of encoding, rather than the traditional
.Nm uuencode
algorithm.
.It Fl o Ar output_file
Output to
.Ar output_file
instead of standard output.
.El
.Pp
The following options are available for
.Nm uudecode :
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Fl c
Decode more than one uuencode'd file from
.Ar file
if possible.
.It Fl i
Do not overwrite files.
.It Fl o Ar output_file
Output to
.Ar output_file
instead of any pathname contained in the input data.
.It Fl p
Decode
.Ar file
and write output to standard output.
.It Fl s
Do not strip output pathname to base filename.
By default
.Nm uudecode
deletes any prefix ending with the last slash '/' for security
purpose.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example packages up a source tree, compresses it,
uuencodes it and mails it to a user on another system.
When
.Nm uudecode
is run on the target system, the file ``src_tree.tar.Z'' will be
created which may then be uncompressed and extracted into the original
tree.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
tar cf \- src_tree \&| compress \&|
uuencode src_tree.tar.Z \&| mail sys1!sys2!user
.Ed
.Pp
The following example unpack all uuencode'd
files from your mailbox into your current working directory.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
uudecode -c < $MAIL
.Ed
.Pp
The following example extract a compress'ed tar
archive from your mailbox
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
uudecode -o /dev/stdout < $MAIL | zcat | tar xfv -
.Ed
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
In legacy operation,
.Nm uudecode
masks file modes with 0666,
preventing the creation of executable files.
.Pp
.Nm uudecode
cannot change the mode of a created file
which is not owned by the current user (unless that user is root).
In legacy operation,
.Xr fchmod 2
allows the mode to be changed.
.Pp
For more information about legacy mode, see
.Xr compat 5 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr basename 1 ,
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr uucp 1 ,
.Xr fchmod 2 ,
.Xr uuencode 5
.Sh BUGS
Files encoded using the traditional algorithm are expanded by 35%
(3 bytes become 4, plus control information).
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm uudecode
and
.Nm uuencode
utilities appeared in

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I uustat
command can display various types of status information about the UUCP
system.  It can also be used to cancel or rejuvenate requests made by
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).

By default
.I uustat
displays all jobs queued up for the invoking user, as if given the
.B \-\-user
option with the appropriate argument.

If any of the
.B \-a,
.B \-\-all,
.B \-e,
.B \-\-executions,
.B \-s,
.B \-\-system,
.B \-S,
.B \-\-not-system,
.B \-u,
.B \-\-user,
.B \-U,
.B \-\-not-user,
.B \-c,
.B \-\-command,
.B \-C,
.B \-\-not-command,
.B \-o,
.B \-\-older-than,
.B \-y,
.B \-\-younger-than
options are given, then all jobs which match the combined
specifications are displayed.

The 
.B \-K
or
.B \-\-kill-all
option may be used to kill off a selected group of jobs, such as all
jobs more than 7 days old.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be given to
.I uustat.
.TP 5
.B \-a, \-\-all
List all queued file transfer requests.
.TP 5
.B \-e, \-\-executions
List queued execution requests rather than queued file transfer
requests.  Queued execution requests are processed by
.I uuxqt
(8) rather than
.I uucico
(8).  Queued execution requests may be waiting for some file to be
transferred from a remote system.  They are created by an invocation
of
.I uux
(1).
.TP 5
.B \-s system, \-\-system system
List all jobs queued up for the named system.  These options may be
specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the systems
will be listed.  If used with
.B \-\-list
only the systems named will be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-S system, \-\-not-system system
List all jobs queued for systems other than the one named.  These
options may be specified multiple times, in which case no jobs from
any of the specified systems will be listed.  If used with
.B \-\-list
only the systems not named will be listed.  These options may not be
used with
.B \-s
or
.B \-\-system.
.TP 5
.B \-u user, \-\-user user
List all jobs queued up for the named user.  These options may be
specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the users
will be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-U user, \-\-not-user user
List all jobs queued up for users other than the one named.  These
options may be specified multiple times, in which case no jobs from
any of the specified users will be listed.  These options may not be
used with
.B \-u
or
.B \-\-user.
.TP 5
.B \-c command, \-\-command command
List all jobs requesting the execution of the named command.  If
.B command
is
.I ALL
this will list all jobs requesting the execution of some command (as
opposed to simply requesting a file transfer).  These options may be
specified multiple times, in which case all jobs requesting any of the
commands will be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-C command, \-\-not-command command
List all jobs requesting execution of some command other than the
named command, or, if
.B command
is
.I ALL,
list all jobs that simply request a file transfer (as opposed to
requesting the execution of some command).  These options may be
specified multiple times, in which case no job requesting one of the
specified commands will be listed.  These options may not be used with
.B \-c
or
.B \-\-command.
.TP 5
.B \-o hours, \-\-older-than hours
List all queued jobs older than the given number of hours.  If used
with
.B \-\-list
only systems whose oldest job is older than the given number of hours
will be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-y hours, \-\-younger-than hours
List all queued jobs younger than the given number of hours.  If used
with
.B \-\-list
only systems whose oldest job is younger than the given number of
hours will be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-k jobid, \-\-kill jobid
Kill the named job.  The job id is shown by the default output format,
as well as by the
.B \-j
or
.B \-\-jobid
option to
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).  A job may only be killed by the user who created the job, or by
the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The
.B \-k
or
.B \-\-kill
options may be used multiple times on the command line to kill several
jobs.
.TP 5
.B \-r jobid, \-\-rejuvenate jobid
Rejuvenate the named job.  This will mark it as having been invoked at
the current time, affecting the output of the
.B \-o,
.B \-\-older-than,
.B \-y,
or
.B \-\-younger-than
options and preserving it from any automated cleanup daemon.  The job
id is shown by the default output format, as well as by the
.B \-j
or
.B \-\-jobid
options to
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).  A job may only be rejuvenated by the user who created the job,
or by the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-rejuvenate
options may be used multiple times on the command line to rejuvenate
several jobs.
.TP 5
.B \-q, \-\-list
Display the status of commands, executions and conversations for all
remote systems for which commands or executions are queued.  The
.B \-s,
.B \-\-system,
.B \-S,
.B \-\-not-system,
.B \-o,
.B \-\-older-than,
.B \-y,
and
.B \-\-younger-than
options may be used to restrict the systems which are listed.  Systems
for which no commands or executions are queued will never be listed.
.TP 5
.B \-m, \-\-status
Display the status of conversations for all remote systems.
.TP 5
.B \-p, \-\-ps
Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks on systems or
ports.
.TP 5
.B \-i, \-\-prompt
For each listed job, prompt whether to kill the job or not.  If the
first character of the input line is
.I y
or
.I Y
the job will be killed.
.TP 5
.B \-K, \-\-kill-all
Automatically kill each listed job.  This can be useful for automatic
cleanup scripts, in conjunction with the
.B \-\-mail
and
.B \-\-notify
options.
.TP 5
.B \-R, \-\-rejuvenate-all
Automatically rejuvenate each listed job.  This may not be used with
.B \-\-kill-all.
.TP 5
.B \-M, \-\-mail
For each listed job, send mail to the UUCP administrator.  If the job
is killed (due to
.B \-\-kill-all
or
.B \-\-prompt
with an affirmative response) the mail will indicate that.  A comment
specified by the
.B \-\-comment
option may be included.  If the job is an execution, the initial
portion of its standard input will be included in the mail message;
the number of lines to include may be set with the
.B \-\-mail-lines
option (the default is 100).  If the standard input contains null
characters, it is assumed to be a binary file and is not included.
.TP 5
.B \-N, \-\-notify
For each listed job, send mail to the user who requested the job.  The
mail is identical to that sent by the
.B \-M
or
.B \-\-mail
options.
.TP 5
.B \-W comment, \-\-comment comment
Specify a comment to be included in mail sent with the
.B \-M,
.B \-\-mail,
.B \-N,
or
.B \-\-notify
options.
.TP 5
.B \-B lines, \-\-mail-lines lines
When the
.B \-M,
.B \-\-mail,
.B \-N,
or
.B \-\-notify
options are used to send mail about an execution with standard input,
this option controls the number of lines of standard input to include
in the message.  The default is 100.
.TP 5
.B \-Q, \-\-no-list
Do not actually list the job, but only take any actions indicated by
the
.B \-i,
.B \-\-prompt,
.B \-K,
.B \-\-kill-all,
.B \-M,
.B \-\-mail,
.B \-N
or
.B \-\-notify
options.
.TP 5
.B \-x type, \-\-debug type
Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,
spooldir and execute are meaningful for
.I uustat.

Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the
.B \-\-debug
option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
.B \-\-debug 2
is equivalent to
.B \-\-debug abnormal,chat.
.TP 5
.B \-I file, \-\-config file
Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
depending upon how
.I uustat
was compiled.

.fi
.in -0.5i
This indicates the system, the number of queued commands, the age of
the oldest queued command, the number of queued local executions, the
age of the oldest queued execution, the date of the last conversation,
and the status of that conversation.

.br
.nf
uustat --status
.fi
Display conversation status for all remote systems.  A sample output
line is as follows:
.br
.in +0.5i
.nf
bugs           04-01 15:51 Conversation complete
.fi
.in -0.5i
This indicates the system, the date of the last conversation, and the
status of that conversation.  If the last conversation failed,
.I uustat
will indicate how many attempts have been made to call the system.  If
the retry period is currently preventing calls to that system,
.I uustat
also displays the time when the next call will be permitted.

.br
.nf
uustat --ps
.fi
Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks.  The output
format is system dependent, as
.I uustat
simply invokes
.I ps
(1) on each process holding a lock.

.br
.in +0.5i
.nf
uustat --command rmail --older-than 168 --kill-all --no-list --mail --notify --comment "Queued for over 1 week"
.fi
.in -0.5i
This will kill all
.I rmail
commands that have been queued up waiting for delivery for over 1 week
(168 hours).  For each such command, mail will be sent both to the
UUCP administrator and to the user who requested the rmail execution.
The mail message sent will include the string given by the
.B \-\-comment
option.  The
.B \-\-no-list
option prevents any of the jobs from being listed on the terminal, so
any output from the program will be error messages.

.SH NAME
uuto \- send files to a particular user on a remote system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uuto
files... system!user
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B uuto
program may be used to conveniently send files to a particular 
user on a remote system.
It will arrange for mail to be sent to the remote user 
when the files arrive on the remote system, 
and he or she may easily retrieve the files using the
.B uupick
program.
Note that 
.B uuto 
does not provide any security--any user on the remote system can examine the files.
.PP
The last argument specifies the system and user name to which to send
the files.  The other arguments are the files or directories to be sent.
.PP
The 
.B uuto
program is actually just a trivial shell script which
invokes the 
.B uucp
program with the appropriate arguments.  
.SH OPTIONS
Any option which may be given to 
.B uucp
may also be given to 
.B uuto.

.TH uux 1 "Taylor UUCP 1.07"
.SH NAME
uux \- Remote command execution over UUCP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uux
[ options ] command
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I uux
command is used to execute a command on a remote system, or to execute
a command on the local system using files from remote systems.
The command
is not executed immediately; the request is queued until the
.I uucico
(8) daemon calls the system and executes it.  The daemon is
started automatically unless one of the
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-nouucico
options is given.

The actual command execution is done by the
.I uuxqt
(8) daemon.

File arguments can be gathered from remote systems to the execution
system, as can standard input.  Standard output may be directed to a
file on a remote system.

The command name may be preceded by a system name followed by an
exclamation point if it is to be executed on a remote system.  An
empty system name is taken as the local system.

Each argument that contains an exclamation point is treated as naming
a file.  The system which the file is on is before the exclamation
point, and the pathname on that system follows it.  An empty system
name is taken as the local system; this must be used to transfer a
file to a command being executed on a remote system.  If the path is
not absolute, it will be appended to the current working directory on
the local system; the result may not be meaningful on the remote
system.  A pathname may begin with ~/, in which case it is relative to
the UUCP public directory (usually /usr/spool/uucppublic or
/var/spool/uucppublic) on the appropriate system.  A pathname may
begin with ~name/, in which case it is relative to the home directory
of the named user on the appropriate system.

Standard input and output may be redirected as usual; the pathnames
used may contain exclamation points to indicate that they are on
remote systems.  Note that the redirection characters must be quoted
so that they are passed to
.I uux
rather than interpreted by the shell.  Append redirection (>>) does
not work.

All specified files are gathered together into a single directory
before execution of the command begins.  This means that each file
must have a distinct base name.  For example,
.br
.in +0.5i
.nf
uux 'sys1!diff sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo >!foo.diff'
.fi
.in -0.5i
will fail because both files will be copied to sys1 and stored under
the name foo.

Arguments may be quoted by parentheses to avoid interpretation of
exclamation points.  This is useful when executing the
.I uucp
command on a remote system.

A request to execute an empty command (e.g.,
.I uux sys!)
will create a poll file for the specified system.

The exit status of
.I uux
is one of the codes found in the header file
.B sysexits.h.
In particular,
.B EX_OK
(
.B 0
) indicates success, and 
.B EX_TEMPFAIL
(
.B 75
) indicates a temporary failure.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be given to
.I uux.
.TP 5
.B \-, \-p, \-\-stdin
Read standard input and use it as the standard input for the command
to be executed.
.TP 5
.B \-c, \-\-nocopy
Do not copy local files to the spool directory.  This is the default.
If they are
removed before being processed by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files must be readable by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon,
as well as the by the invoker of
.I uux.
.TP 5
.B \-C, \-\-copy
Copy local files to the spool directory.
.TP 5
.B \-l, \-\-link
Link local files into the spool directory.  If a file can not be
linked because it is on a different device, it will be copied unless
one of the
.B \-c
or
.B \-\-nocopy
options also appears (in other words, use of
.B \-\-link
switches the default from
.B \-\-nocopy
to
.B \-\-copy).
If the files are changed before being processed by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon, the changed versions will be used.  The files must be
readable by the
.I uucico
(8) daemon, as well as by the invoker of
.I uux.
.TP 5
.B \-g grade, \-\-grade grade
Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade
are executed first.  Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to
low.
.TP 5
.B \-n, \-\-notification=no
Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if it fails.
.TP 5
.B \-z, \-\-notification=error
Send mail about the status of the job if an error occurs.  For many
.I uuxqt
daemons, including the Taylor UUCP
.I uuxqt,
this is the default action; for those,
.B \-\-notification=error
will have no effect.  However, some
.I uuxqt
daemons will send mail if the job succeeds unless the
.B \-\-notification=error
option is used, and some other
.I uuxqt
daemons will not send mail if the job fails unless the
.B \-\-notification=error
option is used.
.TP 5
.B \-r, \-\-nouucico
Do not start the
.I uucico
(8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the execution request for later
processing.
.TP 5
.B \-j, \-\-jobid
Print jobids on standard output.  A jobid will be generated for each
file copy operation required to perform the operation.  These file
copies may be cancelled by passing the jobid to the
.B \-\-kill
switch of
.I uustat
(1), which will make the execution impossible to complete.
.TP 5
.B \-a address, \-\-requestor address
Report job status to the specified e-mail address.
.TP 5
.B \-x type, \-\-debug type
Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,
spooldir and execute are meaningful for
.I uux.

Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the
.B \-\-debug
option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
.B \-\-debug 2
is equivalent to
.B \-\-debug abnormal,chat.
.TP 5
.B \-I file, \-\-config file
Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
depending upon how
.I uux
was compiled.
.TP 5
.B \-v, \-\-version
Report version information and exit.
.TP 5
.B \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.br
.nf
uux -z - sys1!rmail user1
.fi
Execute the command ``rmail user1'' on the system sys1, giving it as
standard input whatever is given to
.I uux
as standard input.  If a failure occurs, send a message using
.I mail
(1).

.br
.nf
uux 'diff -c sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 >!file.diff'
.fi
Fetch the two named files from system sys1 and system sys2 and execute
.I diff
putting the result in file.diff in the current directory.  The current
directory must be writable by the
.I uuxqt
(8) daemon for this to work.

.br
.nf
uux 'sys1!uucp ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)'
.fi
Execute 
.I uucp
on the system sys1 copying file1 (on system sys1) to sys2.  This
illustrates the use of parentheses for quoting.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
The remote system may not permit you to execute certain commands.
Many remote systems only permit the execution of
.I rmail
and
.I rnews.

Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the
.I uuxqt
(8) daemon on the remote system.
.SH SEE ALSO
mail(1), uustat(1), uucp(1), uucico(8), uuxqt(8)
.SH BUGS
Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.

Too many jobids are output by
.B \-\-jobid,
and there is no good way to cancel a local execution requiring remote
files.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBverify\fR command verifies certificate chains.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-CAfile file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAfile file"
A file of trusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates
in \s-1PEM\s0 format concatenated together.
.IP "\fB\-CApath directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CApath directory"
A directory of trusted certificates. The certificates should have names
of the form: hash.0 or have symbolic links to them of this
form (\*(L"hash\*(R" is the hashed certificate subject name: see the \fB\-hash\fR option
of the \fBx509\fR utility). Under Unix the \fBc_rehash\fR script will automatically
create symbolic links to a directory of certificates.
.IP "\fB\-attime timestamp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-attime timestamp"
Perform validation checks using time specified by \fBtimestamp\fR and not
current system time. \fBtimestamp\fR is the number of seconds since
01.01.1970 (\s-1UNIX\s0 time).
.IP "\fB\-check_ss_sig\fR" 4
.IX Item "-check_ss_sig"
Verify the signature on the self-signed root \s-1CA.\s0 This is disabled by default
because it doesn't add any security.
.IP "\fB\-crl_check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-crl_check"
Checks end entity certificate validity by attempting to look up a valid \s-1CRL.\s0
If a valid \s-1CRL\s0 cannot be found an error occurs.
.IP "\fB\-crl_check_all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-crl_check_all"
Checks the validity of \fBall\fR certificates in the chain by attempting
to look up valid CRLs.
.IP "\fB\-explicit_policy\fR" 4
.IX Item "-explicit_policy"
Set policy variable require-explicit-policy (see \s-1RFC5280\s0).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Print out a usage message.
.IP "\fB\-ignore_critical\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ignore_critical"
Normally if an unhandled critical extension is present which is not
supported by OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as required by \s-1RFC5280\s0).
If this option is set critical extensions are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-inhibit_any\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inhibit_any"
Set policy variable inhibit-any-policy (see \s-1RFC5280\s0).
.IP "\fB\-inhibit_map\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inhibit_map"
Set policy variable inhibit-policy-mapping (see \s-1RFC5280\s0).
.IP "\fB\-issuer_checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-issuer_checks"
Print out diagnostics relating to searches for the issuer certificate of the
current certificate. This shows why each candidate issuer certificate was
rejected. The presence of rejection messages does not itself imply that
anything is wrong; during the normal verification process, several
rejections may take place.
.IP "\fB\-policy arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policy arg"
Enable policy processing and add \fBarg\fR to the user-initial-policy-set (see
\&\s-1RFC5280\s0). The policy \fBarg\fR can be an object name an \s-1OID\s0 in numeric form.
This argument can appear more than once.
.IP "\fB\-policy_check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policy_check"
Enables certificate policy processing.
.IP "\fB\-policy_print\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policy_print"
Print out diagnostics related to policy processing.
.IP "\fB\-purpose purpose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-purpose purpose"
The intended use for the certificate. If this option is not specified,
\&\fBverify\fR will not consider certificate purpose during chain verification.
Currently accepted uses are \fBsslclient\fR, \fBsslserver\fR, \fBnssslserver\fR,
\&\fBsmimesign\fR, \fBsmimeencrypt\fR. See the \fB\s-1VERIFY OPERATION\s0\fR section for more
information.
.IP "\fB\-untrusted file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-untrusted file"
A file of untrusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates
in \s-1PEM\s0 format concatenated together.
.IP "\fB\-use_deltas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-use_deltas"
Enable support for delta CRLs.
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
Print extra information about the operations being performed.
.IP "\fB\-verify_depth num\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify_depth num"
Limit the maximum depth of the certificate chain to \fBnum\fR certificates.
.IP "\fB\-x509_strict\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x509_strict"
For strict X.509 compliance, disable non-compliant workarounds for broken
certificates.
.IP "\fB\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-"
Indicates the last option. All arguments following this are assumed to be
certificate files. This is useful if the first certificate filename begins
with a \fB\-\fR.
.IP "\fBcertificates\fR" 4
.IX Item "certificates"
One or more certificates to verify. If no certificates are given, \fBverify\fR
will attempt to read a certificate from standard input. Certificates must be
in \s-1PEM\s0 format.
.SH "VERIFY OPERATION"
.IX Header "VERIFY OPERATION"
The \fBverify\fR program uses the same functions as the internal \s-1SSL\s0 and S/MIME
verification, therefore this description applies to these verify operations
too.
.PP
There is one crucial difference between the verify operations performed
by the \fBverify\fR program: wherever possible an attempt is made to continue
after an error whereas normally the verify operation would halt on the
first error. This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be
determined.
.PP
The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.
.PP
Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate
and ending in the root \s-1CA.\s0 It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built
up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current
certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed 
to be the root \s-1CA.\s0
.PP
The process of 'looking up the issuers certificate' itself involves a number
of steps. In versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.5a the first certificate whose
subject name matched the issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be
the issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all certificates
whose subject name matches the issuer name of the current certificate are 
subject to further tests. The relevant authority key identifier components
of the current certificate (if present) must match the subject key identifier
(if present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer, in addition
the keyUsage extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit
certificate signing.
.PP
The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match
is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The root \s-1CA\s0
is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to
verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in the trusted
list.
.PP
The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for
consistency with the supplied purpose. If the \fB\-purpose\fR option is not included
then no checks are done. The supplied or \*(L"leaf\*(R" certificate must have extensions
compatible with the supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid
\&\s-1CA\s0 certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more detail in
the \fB\s-1CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS\s0\fR section of the \fBx509\fR utility.
.PP
The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root \s-1CA.\s0 The root
\&\s-1CA\s0 should be trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with previous
versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL a certificate with no trust settings is considered
to be valid for all purposes.
.PP
The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain. The validity
period is checked against the current system time and the notBefore and notAfter
dates in the certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at this
point.
.PP
If all operations complete successfully then certificate is considered valid. If
any operation fails then the certificate is not valid.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
When a verify operation fails the output messages can be somewhat cryptic. The
general form of the error message is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
\& error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate
.Ve
.PP
The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified followed by
the subject name of the certificate. The second line contains the error number
and the depth. The depth is number of the certificate being verified when a
problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being verified itself
then 1 for the \s-1CA\s0 that signed the certificate and so on. Finally a text version
of the error number is presented.
.PP
An exhaustive list of the error codes and messages is shown below, this also
includes the name of the error code as defined in the header file x509_vfy.h
Some of the error codes are defined but never returned: these are described
as \*(L"unused\*(R".

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Although the issuer checks are a considerable improvement over the old technique they still
suffer from limitations in the underlying X509_LOOKUP \s-1API.\s0 One consequence of this is that
trusted certificates with matching subject name must either appear in a file (as specified by the
\&\fB\-CAfile\fR option) or a directory (as specified by \fB\-CApath\fR). If they occur in both then only
the certificates in the file will be recognised.
.PP
Previous versions of OpenSSL assume certificates with matching subject name are identical and
mishandled them.
.PP
Previous versions of this documentation swapped the meaning of the
\&\fBX509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT\fR and
\&\fB20 X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY\fR error codes.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vim
is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.
It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.
It is especially useful for editing programs.
.PP
There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo,
multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..
See ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between
.B Vim
and Vi.
.PP
While running
.B Vim
a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the ":help"
command.
See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
.PP
Most often
.B Vim
is started to edit a single file with the command
.PP
	vim file
.PP
More generally
.B Vim
is started with:
.PP
	vim [options] [filelist]
.PP
If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.
.TP 12
file ..
A list of filenames.
The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
You can get to the other files with the ":next" command.
To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "\-\-".
.TP
\-
The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which
should be a tty.
.TP
\-t {tag}
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a "tag", a sort
of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
name.
The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file
and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function.
See ":help tag\-commands".
.TP
\-q [errorfile]
Start in quickFix mode.
The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
option (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors.err" on other
systems).
Further errors can be jumped to with the ":cn" command.
See ":help quickfix".
.PP
.B Vim
behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).
.TP 10
vim
The "normal" way, everything is default.
.TP
ex
Start in Ex mode.
Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
Can also be done with the "\-e" argument.
.TP
view
Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can
also be done with the "\-R" argument.
.TP
gvim gview
The GUI version.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-g" argument.
.TP
evim eview
The GUI version in easy mode.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-y" argument.
.TP
rvim rview rgvim rgview
Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell
commands, or suspend
.B Vim.
Can also be done with the "\-Z" argument.
.SH OPTIONS
The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
.TP 12
+[num]
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line "num".
If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last line.
.TP
+/{pat}
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
first occurrence of {pat}.
See ":help search\-pattern" for the available search patterns.
.TP
+{command}
.TP
\-c {command}
{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read.
{command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes (this
depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim "+set si" main.c
.br
Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-S {file}
{file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.
This is equivalent to \-c "source {file}".
{file} cannot start with '\-'.
If {file} is omitted "Session.vim" is used (only works when \-S is the last
argument).
.TP
\-\-cmd {command}
Like using "\-c", but the command is executed just before
processing any vimrc file.
You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-A
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Arabic mode, i.e. 'arabic' is set.  Otherwise an error
message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-b
Binary mode.
A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.
.TP
\-C
Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.
.TP
\-d
Start in diff mode.
There should be two, three or four file name arguments.
.B Vim
will open all the files and show differences between them.
Works like vimdiff(1).
.TP
\-d {device}
Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga.
Example:
"\-d con:20/30/600/150".
.TP
\-D
Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a
script.
.TP
\-e
Start
.B Vim
in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".
.TP
\-E
Start
.B Vim
in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".
.TP
\-f
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
On the Amiga,
.B Vim
is not restarted to open a new window.
This option should be used when
.B Vim
is executed by a program that will wait for the edit
session to finish (e.g. mail).
On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.
.TP
\-\-nofork
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
.TP
\-F
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-g
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.
If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-h
Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.
After this
.B Vim
exits.
.TP
\-H
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-i {viminfo}
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use,
instead of the default "~/.viminfo".
This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
"NONE".
.TP
\-L
Same as \-r.
.TP
\-l
Lisp mode.
Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.
.TP
\-m
Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the 'write' option.
You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.
.TP
\-M
Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be unset,
so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these
options can be set to enable making modifications.
.TP
\-N
No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does
not exist.
.TP
\-n
No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).
Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
Can be undone with ":set uc=200".
.TP
\-nb
Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.
.TP
\-o[N]
Open N windows stacked.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-O[N]
Open N windows side by side.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-p[N]
Open N tab pages.
When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.
.TP
\-R
Read-only mode.
The 'readonly' option will be set.
You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in ":w!".
The \-R option also implies the \-n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".
See ":help 'readonly'".
.TP
\-r
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
.TP
\-r {file}
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp"
appended.
See ":help recovery".
.TP
\-s
Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "\-e" option was given
before the "\-s" option.
.TP
\-s {scriptin}
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
.TP
\-T {terminal}
Tells
.B Vim
the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
.B Vim
(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
.TP
\-u {vimrc}
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help initialization" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-U {gvimrc}
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help gui\-init" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-V[N]
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
Default is 10.
.TP
\-v
Start
.B Vim
in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only has effect
when the executable is called "ex".
.TP
\-w {scriptout}
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
.B Vim.
This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim \-s" or
":source!".
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
.TP
\-W {scriptout}
Like \-w, but an existing file is overwritten.
.TP
\-x
Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.
.TP
\-X
Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the
window title and clipboard will not be used.
.TP
\-y
Start
.B Vim
in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
Makes
.B Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.
.TP
\-Z
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".
.TP
\-\-
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '\-'.
.TP
\-\-echo\-wid
GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.
.TP
\-\-help
Give a help message and exit, just like "\-h".
.TP
\-\-literal
Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.
.TP
\-\-noplugin
Skip loading plugins.  Implied by \-u NONE.
.TP
\-\-remote
Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments.  If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
in the current Vim.
.TP
\-\-remote\-expr {expr}
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.
.TP
\-\-remote\-send {keys}
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.
.TP
\-\-remote\-silent
As \-\-remote, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait
As \-\-remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait\-silent
As \-\-remote\-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-serverlist
List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.
.TP
\-\-servername {name}
Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a
\-\-remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.
.TP
\-\-socketid {id}
GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.
.TP
\-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
Type ":help" in
.B Vim
to get started.
Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject.
For example: ":help ZZ" to get help for the "ZZ" command.
Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help cmdline\-completion").
Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort of hypertext links,
see ":help").
All documentation files can be viewed in this way, for example
":help syntax.txt".

Probably.
See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.

Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim).
Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.

multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..
See ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between
.B Vim
and Vi.
.PP
While running
.B Vim
a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the ":help"
command.
See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
.PP
Most often
.B Vim
is started to edit a single file with the command
.PP
	vim file
.PP
More generally
.B Vim
is started with:
.PP
	vim [options] [filelist]
.PP
If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.
.TP 12
file ..
A list of filenames.
The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
You can get to the other files with the ":next" command.
To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "\-\-".
.TP
\-
The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which
should be a tty.
.TP
\-t {tag}
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a "tag", a sort
of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
name.
The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file
and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function.
See ":help tag\-commands".
.TP
\-q [errorfile]
Start in quickFix mode.
The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
option (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors.err" on other
systems).
Further errors can be jumped to with the ":cn" command.
See ":help quickfix".
.PP
.B Vim
behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).
.TP 10
vim
The "normal" way, everything is default.
.TP
ex
Start in Ex mode.
Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
Can also be done with the "\-e" argument.
.TP
view
Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can
also be done with the "\-R" argument.
.TP
gvim gview
The GUI version.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-g" argument.
.TP
evim eview
The GUI version in easy mode.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-y" argument.
.TP
rvim rview rgvim rgview
Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell
commands, or suspend
.B Vim.
Can also be done with the "\-Z" argument.
.SH OPTIONS
The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
.TP 12
+[num]
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line "num".
If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last line.
.TP
+/{pat}
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
first occurrence of {pat}.
See ":help search\-pattern" for the available search patterns.
.TP
+{command}
.TP
\-c {command}
{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read.
{command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes (this
depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim "+set si" main.c
.br
Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-S {file}
{file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.
This is equivalent to \-c "source {file}".
{file} cannot start with '\-'.
If {file} is omitted "Session.vim" is used (only works when \-S is the last
argument).
.TP
\-\-cmd {command}
Like using "\-c", but the command is executed just before
processing any vimrc file.
You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-A
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Arabic mode, i.e. 'arabic' is set.  Otherwise an error
message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-b
Binary mode.
A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.
.TP
\-C
Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.
.TP
\-d
Start in diff mode.
There should be two, three or four file name arguments.
.B Vim
will open all the files and show differences between them.
Works like vimdiff(1).
.TP
\-d {device}
Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga.
Example:
"\-d con:20/30/600/150".
.TP
\-D
Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a
script.
.TP
\-e
Start
.B Vim
in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".
.TP
\-E
Start
.B Vim
in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".
.TP
\-f
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
On the Amiga,
.B Vim
is not restarted to open a new window.
This option should be used when
.B Vim
is executed by a program that will wait for the edit
session to finish (e.g. mail).
On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.
.TP
\-\-nofork
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
.TP
\-F
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-g
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.
If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-h
Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.
After this
.B Vim
exits.
.TP
\-H
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-i {viminfo}
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use,
instead of the default "~/.viminfo".
This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
"NONE".
.TP
\-L
Same as \-r.
.TP
\-l
Lisp mode.
Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.
.TP
\-m
Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the 'write' option.
You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.
.TP
\-M
Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be unset,
so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these
options can be set to enable making modifications.
.TP
\-N
No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does
not exist.
.TP
\-n
No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).
Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
Can be undone with ":set uc=200".
.TP
\-nb
Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.
.TP
\-o[N]
Open N windows stacked.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-O[N]
Open N windows side by side.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-p[N]
Open N tab pages.
When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.
.TP
\-R
Read-only mode.
The 'readonly' option will be set.
You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in ":w!".
The \-R option also implies the \-n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".
See ":help 'readonly'".
.TP
\-r
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
.TP
\-r {file}
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp"
appended.
See ":help recovery".
.TP
\-s
Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "\-e" option was given
before the "\-s" option.
.TP
\-s {scriptin}
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
.TP
\-T {terminal}
Tells
.B Vim
the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
.B Vim
(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
.TP
\-u {vimrc}
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help initialization" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-U {gvimrc}
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help gui\-init" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-V[N]
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
Default is 10.
.TP
\-v
Start
.B Vim
in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only has effect
when the executable is called "ex".
.TP
\-w {scriptout}
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
.B Vim.
This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim \-s" or
":source!".
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
.TP
\-W {scriptout}
Like \-w, but an existing file is overwritten.
.TP
\-x
Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.
.TP
\-X
Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the
window title and clipboard will not be used.
.TP
\-y
Start
.B Vim
in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
Makes
.B Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.
.TP
\-Z
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".
.TP
\-\-
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '\-'.
.TP
\-\-echo\-wid
GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.
.TP
\-\-help
Give a help message and exit, just like "\-h".
.TP
\-\-literal
Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.
.TP
\-\-noplugin
Skip loading plugins.  Implied by \-u NONE.
.TP
\-\-remote
Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments.  If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
in the current Vim.
.TP
\-\-remote\-expr {expr}
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.
.TP
\-\-remote\-send {keys}
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.
.TP
\-\-remote\-silent
As \-\-remote, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait
As \-\-remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait\-silent
As \-\-remote\-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-serverlist
List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.
.TP
\-\-servername {name}
Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a
\-\-remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.
.TP
\-\-socketid {id}
GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.
.TP
\-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
Type ":help" in
.B Vim
to get started.
Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject.
For example: ":help ZZ" to get help for the "ZZ" command.
Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help cmdline\-completion").
Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort of hypertext links,
see ":help").
All documentation files can be viewed in this way, for example
":help syntax.txt".

Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim).
Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vim
is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.
It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.
It is especially useful for editing programs.

You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in ":w!".
The \-R option also implies the \-n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".
See ":help 'readonly'".
.TP
\-r
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
.TP
\-r {file}
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp"
appended.
See ":help recovery".
.TP
\-s
Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "\-e" option was given
before the "\-s" option.
.TP
\-s {scriptin}
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
.TP
\-T {terminal}
Tells
.B Vim
the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
.B Vim
(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
.TP
\-u {vimrc}
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help initialization" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-U {gvimrc}
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help gui\-init" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-V[N]
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
Default is 10.
.TP
\-v
Start
.B Vim
in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only has effect
when the executable is called "ex".
.TP
\-w {scriptout}
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
.B Vim.
This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim \-s" or
":source!".
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
.TP
\-W {scriptout}
Like \-w, but an existing file is overwritten.
.TP
\-x
Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.
.TP
\-X
Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the
window title and clipboard will not be used.
.TP
\-y
Start
.B Vim
in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
Makes
.B Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.
.TP
\-Z
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".
.TP
\-\-
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '\-'.
.TP
\-\-echo\-wid
GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.
.TP
\-\-help
Give a help message and exit, just like "\-h".
.TP
\-\-literal
Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.
.TP
\-\-noplugin
Skip loading plugins.  Implied by \-u NONE.
.TP
\-\-remote
Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments.  If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
in the current Vim.
.TP
\-\-remote\-expr {expr}
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.
.TP
\-\-remote\-send {keys}
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.
.TP
\-\-remote\-silent
As \-\-remote, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait
As \-\-remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait\-silent
As \-\-remote\-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-serverlist
List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.
.TP
\-\-servername {name}
Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a
\-\-remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.
.TP
\-\-socketid {id}
GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.
.TP
\-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
Type ":help" in
.B Vim
to get started.
Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject.
For example: ":help ZZ" to get help for the "ZZ" command.
Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help cmdline\-completion").
Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort of hypertext links,
see ":help").
All documentation files can be viewed in this way, for example
":help syntax.txt".

Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim).
Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.

.PP
.B gvimdiff
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vimdiff
starts
.B Vim
on two (or three or four) files.
Each file gets its own window.
The differences between the files are highlighted.
This is a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from one version
to another version of the same file.
.PP
See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.
.PP
When started as
.B gvimdiff
the GUI will be started, if available.
.PP
In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the differences
to be highlighted.
.br
The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good.
.br
The 'foldmethod' option is set to "diff", which puts ranges of lines without
changes in a fold.  'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy to spot the
folds and open or close them.
.SH OPTIONS
Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if the "\-O" argument was used.
To use horizontal splits instead, use the "\-o" argument.
.PP

the original file.
.PP
The
.B Vimtutor
is useful for people that want to learn their first
.B Vim
commands.
.PP
The optional argument \-g starts vimtutor with gvim rather than vim, if the
GUI version of vim is available, or falls back to Vim if gvim is not found.
.PP
The optional [language] argument is the two-letter name of a language, like
"it" or "es".
If the [language] argument is missing, the language of the current locale will
be used.
If a tutor in this language is available, it will be used.
Otherwise the English version will be used.
.PP
.B Vim
is always started in Vi compatible mode.
.SH FILES

.Sh NAME
.Nm vis
.Nd display non-printable characters in a visual format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cbflnostw
.Op Fl F Ar foldwidth
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a filter for converting non-printable characters
into a visual representation.
It differs from
.Ql cat -v
in that
the form is unique and invertible.
By default, all non-graphic
characters except space, tab, and newline are encoded.
A detailed description of the
various visual formats is given in
.Xr vis 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow control sequences
and meta characters, and disables the doubling of backslashes.
This
produces output which is neither invertible or precise, but does
represent a minimum of change to the input.
It is similar to
.Dq Li cat -v .
.It Fl c
Request a format which displays a small subset of the
non-printable characters using C-style backslash sequences.
.It Fl F
Causes
.Nm
to fold output lines to foldwidth columns (default 80), like
.Xr fold 1 ,
except
that a hidden newline sequence is used, (which is removed
when inverting the file back to its original form with
.Xr unvis 1 ) .
If the last character in the encoded file does not end in a newline,
a hidden newline sequence is appended to the output.
This makes
the output usable with various editors and other utilities which
typically do not work with partial lines.
.It Fl f
Same as
.Fl F .
.It Fl l
Mark newlines with the visible sequence
.Ql \e$ ,
followed by the newline.
.It Fl n
Turns off any encoding, except for the fact that backslashes are
still doubled and hidden newline sequences inserted if
.Fl f
or
.Fl F
is selected.
When combined with the
.Fl f
flag,
.Nm
becomes like
an invertible version of the
.Xr fold 1
utility.
That is, the output
can be unfolded by running the output through
.Xr unvis 1 .
.It Fl o
Request a format which displays non-printable characters as
an octal number, \eddd.
.It Fl s
Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal are encoded.
This flag allows backspace, bell, and carriage return in addition
to the default space, tab and newline.
.It Fl t
Tabs are also encoded.
.It Fl w
White space (space-tab-newline) is also encoded.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr unvis 1 ,
.Xr vis 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
Due to limitations in the underlying
.Xr vis 3
function, the
.Nm
utility
does not recognize multibyte characters, and thus may consider them to be
non-printable when they are in fact printable (and vice versa).

.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm vm_stat 
displays Mach virtual memory statistics.  If the optional 
.Ar interval 
is specified, then 
.Nm vm_stat 
will display the statistics every 
.Ar interval 
seconds.  In this case, each line of output displays the change in
each statistic (an
.Ar interval 
count of 1 displays the values per second).  However, the first line
of output following each banner displays the system-wide totals for
each statistic.
If a
.Ar count
is provided, the command will terminate after
.Ar count
intervals.
The following values are displayed:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pages free
the total number of free pages in the system.
.It Pages active
the total number of pages currently in use and pageable.
.It Pages inactive
the total number of pages on the inactive list.
.It Pages speculative
the total number of pages on the speculative list.
.It Pages throttled
the total number of pages on the throttled list (not wired but not pageable). 
.It Pages wired down
the total number of pages wired down.  That is, pages that cannot be
paged out.
.It Pages purgeable
the total number of purgeable pages.
.It Translation faults
the number of times the "vm_fault" routine has been called.
.It Pages copy-on-write
the number of faults that caused a page to be
copied (generally caused by copy-on-write faults).
.It Pages zero filled
the total number of pages that have been zero-filled on demand.
.It Pages reactivated
the total number of pages that have been moved from the inactive list
to the active list (reactivated).
.It Pages purged
the total number of pages that have been purged.
.It File-backed pages
the total number of pages that are file-backed (non-swap)
.It Anonymous pages
the total number of pages that are anonymous
.It Uncompressed pages
the total number of pages (uncompressed) held within the compressor
.It Pages used by VM compressor:
the number of pages used to store compressed VM pages.
.It Pages decompressed
the total number of pages that have been decompressed by the VM compressor.
.It Pages compressed
the total number of pages that have been compressed by the VM compressor.
.It Pageins
the total number of requests for pages from a pager (such as the inode pager).
.It Pageouts
the total number of pages that have been paged out.
.It Swapins
the total number of compressed pages that have been swapped out to disk.
.It Swapouts
the total number of compressed pages that have been swapped back in from disk.
.El
.Pp
If 
.Ar interval 
is not specified, then

.Pp
.Sh EXPLANATION OF OUTPUT
For each region,
.Nm vmmap
describes the starting address, ending address, size of the region (in kilobytes or pages),
read/write permissions for the page, sharing mode for the page, and the
purpose of the pages.
.Pp
The size of the virtual memory region represents the virtual memory pages
reserved, but not necessarily allocated.  For example, using the vm_allocate
Mach system call reserves the pages, but physical memory won't be allocated
for the page until the memory is actually touched.  A memory-mapped file may
have a virtual memory page reserved, but the pages are not instantiated until
a read or write happens.
Thus, this size may not correctly describe the application's true memory
usage.
.Pp
By default, the sizes are shown in kilobytes or megabytes.  If the \fB-pages\fR
flag is given, then the sizes are in number of VM pages.
.Pp
The protection mode describes if the memory is readable, writable, or
executable.  Each virtual memory region has a current permission, and
a maximum permission.  In the line for a virtual memory region, the
current permission is displayed first, the maximum permission second.
For example, the first page of an application (starting at address
0x00000000) permits neither reads, writes, or execution ("---"),
ensuring that any reads or writes to address 0, or dereferences of a
NULL pointer immediately cause a bus error.  Pages representing an
executable always have the execute and read bits set ("r-x").  The
current permissions usually do not permit writing to the region.
However, the maximum permissions allow writing so that the debugger
can request write access to a page to insert breakpoints.
Permissions for executables appear as "r-x/rwx" to indicate these
permissions.
.Pp
The share mode describes whether pages are shared between processes,and
what happens when pages are modified.  Private pages (PRV) are pages only
visible to this process.  They are allocated as they are written to, and can
be paged out to disk. Copy-on-write (COW) pages are shared by multiple processes
(or shared by a single process in multiple locations).  When the page
is modified, the writing process then receives its own private copy of the page.
Empty (NUL) sharing implies that the page does not really exist in physical
memory.  Aliased (ALI) and shared (SHM) memory is shared between processes.
.Pp
The share mode typically describes the general mode controlling the region.
For example, as copy-on-write pages are modified, they become private to the
application.  Even with the private pages, the region is still COW until all
pages become private.  Once all pages are private, then the share mode would
change to private.  
.Pp
The far left column names the purpose of the memory: 
malloc regions, stack, text or data segment, etc.  For regions
loaded from binaries, the far right shows the library loaded into the
memory.
.Pp
If the \fB-submap\fR flag is given, then vmmap's output includes descriptions of submaps.
A submap is a shared set of virtual memory page descriptions that the
operating system can reuse between multiple processes.  Submaps
minimize the operating system's memory usage by representing the virtual memory
regions only once.  Submaps can either be shared by all processes 
(machine-wide) or local to the process (process-only).  (Understanding
where submaps are located is irrelevant for most developers, but may be
interesting for anyone working with low levels of the virtual memory system.)
.Pp
For example, one submap contains the read-only portions of the most common dynamic libraries.
These libraries are needed by most programs on the system, and because they are read-only,
they will never be changed.
As a result, the operating system shares these pages between all the processes,
and only needs to create a single data structure to describe how this memory
is laid out in every process.
.Pp
That section of memory is referred to as the "split library region", and
it is shared system-wide.  So, technically, all of the dynamic libraries that
have been loaded into that region are in the VM map of every process, even though
some processes may not be using some of those libraries.  By default, vmmap shows
only those shared system split libraries that have been loaded into the specified
target process.  If the \fB-allSplitLibs\fR flags is given, information about all
shared system split libraries will be printed, regardless of whether they've been
loaded into the specified target process or not.
.Pp
If the contents of
a machine-wide submap are changed -- for example, the debugger makes a section
of memory for a dylib writable so it can insert debugging traps -- then
the submap becomes local, and the kernel will allocate memory to store the
extra copy.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr heap 1 ,
.Xr leaks 1 ,
.Xr malloc_history 1 ,
.Xr stringdups 1 ,
.Xr lsof 8
.Pp
The heap, leaks, and malloc_history commands can be used to look at various
aspects of a process's memory usage.
.Pp
The lsof command can be used to get a list of open and mapped files in one
or more processes, which can help determine why a volume can't be unmounted
or ejected, for example.
.Pp
The Xcode developer tools also include Instruments, a graphical application that can give information similar to that provided by
.Nm vmmap.
The Allocations instrument graphically displays dynamic, real-time
information about the object and memory use in an application (including VM allocations), as well as backtraces
of where the allocations occured.  The VM Tracker instrument in the Allocations template graphically displays
information about the virtual memory regions in a process.

.Sh NAME
.Nm w
.Nd "display who is logged in and what they are doing"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hin
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints a summary of the current activity on the system,
including what each user is doing.
The first line displays the current time of day, how long the system has
been running, the number of users logged into the system, and the load
averages.
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged
over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
.Pp
The fields output are the user's login name, the name of the terminal the
user is on, the host from which the user is logged in, the time the user
logged on, the time since the user last typed anything,
and the name and arguments of the current process.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Suppress the heading.
.It Fl i
Output is sorted by idle time.
.El
.Pp
If one or more
.Ar user
names are specified, the output is restricted to those users.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fl M ,
.FL N ,
.Fl d ,
.Fl f ,
.Fl l ,
.Fl n ,
.Fl s ,
and
.Fl w
flags are no longer supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The notion of the
.Dq current process
is muddy.
The current algorithm is ``the highest numbered process on the terminal
that is not ignoring interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered
process on the terminal''.
This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs like the shell
and editor, or when faulty programs running in the background fork and fail
to ignore interrupts.
(In cases where no process can be found,
.Nm
prints
.Dq \- . )
.Pp
The
.Tn CPU
time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves a background
process running after logging out, the person currently on that terminal is
.Dq charged
with the time.
.Pp
Background processes are not shown, even though they account for
much of the load on the system.
.Pp
Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are printed with
null or garbaged arguments.
In these cases, the name of the command is printed in parentheses.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not know about the new conventions for detection of background
jobs.
It will sometimes find a background job instead of the right one.
.Pp
Long hostnames and IPv6 addresses may be truncated; however, the
.Xr who 1
utility will display full hostnames.

.Sh NAME
.Nm wc
.Nd word, line, character, and byte count
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl clmw
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each
input
.Ar file ,
or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.
A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a
.Aq newline
character.
Characters beyond the final
.Aq newline
character will not be included
in the line count.
.Pp
A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
characters.
White space characters are the set of characters for which the
.Xr iswspace 3
function returns true.
If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative counts
for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for
the last file.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The number of bytes in each input file
is written to the standard output.
This will cancel out any prior usage of the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl l
The number of lines in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.It Fl m
The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.
If the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this
is equivalent to the
.Fl c
option.
This will cancel out any prior usage of the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl w
The number of words in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.El
.Pp
When an option is specified,
.Nm
only reports the information requested by that option.
The order of output always takes the form of line, word,
byte, and file name.
The default action is equivalent to specifying the
.Fl c , l
and
.Fl w
options.
.Pp
If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no
file name is displayed.
The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or
.Bq ^D
in most environments.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL
and
.Ev LC_CTYPE
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Count the number of characters, words and lines in each of the files
.Pa report1
and
.Pa report2
as well as the totals for both:
.Pp
.Dl "wc -mlw report1 report2"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historically, the
.Nm
utility was documented to define a word as a ``maximal string of
characters delimited by <space>, <tab> or <newline> characters''.
The implementation, however, did not handle non-printing characters
correctly so that
.Dq Li "  ^D^E  "
counted as 6 spaces, while
.Dq Li foo^D^Ebar
counted as 8 characters.
.Bx 4
systems after
.Bx 4.3
modified the implementation to be consistent
with the documentation.
This implementation defines a ``word'' in terms of the
.Xr iswspace 3
function, as required by
.St -p1003.2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iswspace 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v1 .

.SH NAME
weblatency.d \- website latency statistics. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B weblatency.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints statistics for hostnames that browers have set GET requests 
for, in particular latency by hostname.

The latency measured is from the browser sending the GET
request to when the browser begins to recieve the response. It
is an overall response time for the client, and encompasses
connection speed delays, DNS lookups, proxy delays, and web server
response time.

This is written as an experimental tool, and may not work at all with
your browser.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Print report after Ctrl-C is hit,
# 
.B weblatency.d
.PP
.SH FIELDS
.TP
HOST
hostname from URL
.TP
NUM
number of GETs
.TP
AVGTIME(ms)
Average time for response, ms
.TP
MAXTIME(ms)
Maximum time for response, ms
.PP
.SH NOTES
See the source code for the "BROWSER" variable, which sets the browser
to trace (currently set to "mozilla-bin").
.PP
.SH IDEA
Bryan Cantrill (who wrote an elegant version for Sol 10 update 1)
.PP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the 
Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
.SH EXIT
weblatency.d will sample until Ctrl\-C is hit.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aAbdgiIlmQrR6
.Op Fl c Ar country-code | Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility looks up records in the databases maintained by several
Network Information Centers
.Pq Tn NICs .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 6
Use the IPv6 Resource Center
.Pq Tn 6bone
database.
It contains network names and addresses for the IPv6 network.
.It Fl A
Use the Asia/Pacific Network Information Center
.Pq Tn APNIC
database.
It contains network numbers used in East Asia, Australia,
New Zealand, and the Pacific islands.
.It Fl a
Use the American Registry for Internet Numbers
.Pq Tn ARIN
database.
It contains network numbers used in those parts of the world covered neither by
.Tn APNIC
nor by
.Tn RIPE .
.Pp
(Hint: All point of contact handles in the
.Tn ARIN
whois database end with
.Qq Li -ARIN . )
.Pp
.It Fl b
Use the Network Abuse Clearinghouse database.
It contains addresses to which network abuse should be reported,
indexed by domain name.
.It Fl c Ar country-code
This is the equivalent of using the
.Fl h
option with an argument of
.Qq Ar country-code Ns Li .whois-servers.net .
.It Fl d
Use the US Department of Defense
database.
It contains points of contact for subdomains of
.Pa .MIL .
.It Fl g
Use the US non-military federal government database, which contains points of
contact for subdomains of
.Pa .GOV .
.It Fl h Ar host
Use the specified host instead of the default variant.
Either a host name or an IP address may be specified.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
constructs the name of a whois server to use from the top-level domain
.Pq Tn TLD
of the supplied (single) argument, and appending
.Qq Li .whois-servers.net .
This effectively allows a suitable whois server to be selected
automatically for a large number of
.Tn TLDs .
.Pp
In the event that an IP
address is specified, the whois server will default to the American
Registry for Internet Numbers
.Pq Tn ARIN .
If a query to
.Tn ARIN
references
.Tn APNIC , LACNIC ,
or
.Tn RIPE ,
that server will be queried also, provided that the
.Fl Q
option is not specified.
.Pp
If the query is not a domain name or IP address,
.Nm
will fall back to
.Pa whois.crsnic.net .
.It Fl I
Use the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
.Pq Tn IANA
database.
It contains network information for top-level domains.
.It Fl i
Use the Network Solutions Registry for Internet Numbers
.Pq Pa whois.networksolutions.com
database.
It contains network numbers and domain contact information for most of
.Pa .COM , .NET , .ORG
and
.Pa .EDU
domains.
.Pp
.Sy NOTE !
The registration of these domains is now done
by a number of independent and competing registrars.
This database holds no information on domains registered by organizations
other than Network Solutions, Inc.
Also, note that the
.Tn InterNIC
database
.Pq Pa whois.internic.net
is no longer handled by Network Solutions, Inc.
For details, see
.Pa http://www.internic.net/ .
.Pp
(Hint: Contact information, identified by the term
.Em handle ,
can be looked up by prefixing
.Qq Li "handle "
to the
.Tn NIC
handle in the query.)
.It Fl l
Use the Latin American and Caribbean IP address Regional Registry
.Pq Tn LACNIC
database.
It contains network numbers used in much of Latin America and the
Caribbean.
.It Fl m
Use the Route Arbiter Database
.Pq Tn RADB
database.
It contains route policy specifications for a large
number of operators' networks.
.It Fl p Ar port
Connect to the whois server on
.Ar port .
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
defaults to port 43.
.It Fl Q
Do a quick lookup.
This means that
.Nm
will not attempt to lookup the name in the authoritative whois
server (if one is listed).
This option has no effect when combined with any other options.
.It Fl R
Use the Russia Network Information Center
.Pq Tn RIPN
database.
It contains network numbers and domain contact information
for subdomains of
.Pa .RU .
This option is deprecated; use the
.Fl c
option with an argument of
.Qq Li RU
instead.
.It Fl r
Use the R\(aaeseaux IP Europ\(aaeens
.Pq Tn RIPE
database.
It contains network numbers and domain contact information
for Europe.
.El
.Pp
The operands specified to
.Nm
are treated independently and may be used
as queries on different whois servers.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Most types of data, such as domain names and
.Tn IP
addresses, can be used as arguments to
.Nm
without any options, and
.Nm
will choose the correct whois server to query.
Some exceptions, where
.Nm
will not be able to handle data correctly, are detailed below.
.Pp
To obtain contact information about an
administrator located in the Russian
.Tn TLD
domain
.Qq Li RU ,
use the
.Fl c
option as shown in the following example, where
.Ar CONTACT-ID
is substituted with the actual contact identifier.
.Pp
.Dl "whois -c RU CONTACT-ID"
.Pp
(Note: This example is specific to the
.Tn TLD
.Qq Li RU ,
but other
.Tn TLDs
can be queried by using a similar syntax.)
.Pp
The following example demonstrates how to obtain information about an
.Tn IPv6
address or hostname using the
.Fl 6
option, which directs the query to
.Tn 6bone .
.Pp
.Dl "whois -6 IPv6-IP-Address"
.Pp
The following example demonstrates how to query
a whois server using a non-standard port, where
.Dq Li query-data
is the query to be sent to
.Dq Li whois.example.com
on port
.Dq Li rwhois
(written numerically as 4321).
.Pp
.Dl "whois -h whois.example.com -p rwhois query-data"

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwish\fR ?\fIfileName arg arg ...\fR?
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-colormap \fInew\fR" 20
Specifies that the window should have a new private colormap instead of
using the default colormap for the screen.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 20
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 20
Initial geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its
value is stored in the \fBgeometry\fR global variable of the application's
Tcl interpreter.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 20
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 20
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.VS 8.0 br
.IP "\fB\-use\fR \fIid\fR" 20
Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded in
the window whose identifier is \fIid\fR, instead of being created as an
independent toplevel window.  \fIId\fR must be specified in the same
way as the value for the \fB\-use\fR option for toplevel widgets (i.e.
it has a form like that returned by the \fBwinfo id\fR command).
.VE
.IP "\fB\-visual \fIvisual\fR" 20
Specifies the visual to use for the window.
\fIVisual\fR may have any of the forms supported by the \fBTk_GetVisual\fR
procedure.
.IP "\fB\-\|\-\fR" 20
Pass all remaining arguments through to the script's \fBargv\fR
variable without interpreting them.
This provides a mechanism for passing arguments such as \fB\-name\fR
to a script instead of having \fBwish\fR interpret them.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBWish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands
from standard input or from a file.
It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.
If \fBwish\fR is invoked with no arguments, or with a first argument
that starts with ``\-'', then it reads Tcl commands interactively from
standard input.
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.
If there exists a file \fB.wishrc\fR in the home directory of
the user, \fBwish\fR evaluates the file as a Tcl script
just before reading the first command from standard input.
.PP
If \fBwish\fR is invoked with an initial \fIfileName\fR argument, then 
\fIfileName\fR is treated as the name of a script file.
\fBWish\fR will evaluate the script in \fIfileName\fR (which
presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to events
until all windows have been deleted.
Commands will not be read from standard input.
There is no automatic evaluation of \fB.wishrc\fR when the name
of a script file is presented on the \fBwish\fR command line,
but the script file can always \fBsource\fR it if desired.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBWish\fR automatically processes all of the command-line options
described in the \fBOPTIONS\fR summary above.
Any other command-line arguments besides these are passed through
to the application using the \fBargc\fR and \fBargv\fR variables
described later.

.SH "APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS"
.PP
The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
\fBsend\fR commands, is taken from the \fB\-name\fR option,
if it is specified;  otherwise it is taken from \fIfileName\fR,
if it is specified, or from the command name by which
\fBwish\fR was invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a ``/''
character, then only the characters after the last slash are used
as the application name.
.PP
The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fR property or .Xdefaults
file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.

.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBWish\fR sets the following Tcl variables:
.TP 15
\fBargc\fR
Contains a count of the number of \fIarg\fR arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
.TP 15
\fBargv\fR
Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the \fIarg\fR arguments
that follow a \fB\-\|\-\fR option or don't match any of the
options described in OPTIONS above, in order, or an empty string
if there are no such arguments.
.TP 15
\fBargv0\fR
Contains \fIfileName\fR if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which \fBwish\fR was invoked.
.TP 15
\fBgeometry\fR
If the \fB\-geometry\fR option is specified, \fBwish\fR copies its
value into this variable.  If the variable still exists after
\fIfileName\fR has been evaluated, \fBwish\fR uses the value of
the variable in a \fBwm geometry\fR command to set the main
window's geometry.
.TP 15
\fBtcl_interactive\fR
Contains 1 if \fBwish\fR is reading commands interactively (\fIfileName\fR
was not specified and standard input is a terminal-like
device), 0 otherwise.

.SH "SCRIPT FILES"
.PP
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
.CS
\fB#!/usr/local/bin/wish\fR
.CE
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if
you mark it as executable.
This assumes that \fBwish\fR has been installed in the default
location in /usr/local/bin;  if it's installed somewhere else
then you'll have to modify the above line to match.
Many UNIX systems do not allow the \fB#!\fR line to exceed about
30 characters in length, so be sure that the \fBwish\fR executable
can be accessed with a short file name.
.PP
An even better approach is to start your script files with the
following three lines:
.CS
\fB#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \e
exec wish "$0" "$@"\fR
.CE
This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous
paragraph.  First, the location of the \fBwish\fR binary doesn't have
to be hard-wired into the script:  it can be anywhere in your shell
search path.  Second, it gets around the 30-character file name limit
in the previous approach.
Third, this approach will work even if \fBwish\fR is
itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in order to
handle multiple architectures or operating systems:  the \fBwish\fR
script selects one of several binaries to run).  The three lines
cause both \fBsh\fR and \fBwish\fR to process the script, but the
\fBexec\fR is only executed by \fBsh\fR.
\fBsh\fR processes the script first;  it treats the second
line as a comment and executes the third line.
The \fBexec\fR statement cause the shell to stop processing and
instead to start up \fBwish\fR to reprocess the entire script.
When \fBwish\fR starts up, it treats all three lines as comments,
since the backslash at the end of the second line causes the third
line to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.
.PP
.VS 8.4
The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of
the medium, or by the character, '\\032' ('\\u001a', control-Z).
If this character is present in the file, the \fBwish\fR application
will read text up to but not including the character.  An application
that requires this character in the file may encode it as
``\\032'', ``\\x1a'', or ``\\u001a''; or may generate it by use of commands 
such as \fBformat\fR or \fBbinary\fR.
.VE
.SH PROMPTS
.PP
When \fBwish\fR is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with ``\fB% \fR''.  You can change the prompt by setting the
variables \fBtcl_prompt1\fR and \fBtcl_prompt2\fR.  If variable
\fBtcl_prompt1\fR exists then it must consist of a Tcl script
to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt \fBwish\fR
will evaluate the script in \fBtcl_prompt1\fR.
The variable \fBtcl_prompt2\fR is used in a similar way when
a newline is typed but the current command isn't yet complete;
if \fBtcl_prompt2\fR isn't set then no prompt is output for
incomplete commands.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-encoding \fIname\fR" 20
.VS 8.5
Specifies the encoding of the text stored in \fIfileName\fR.
This option is only recognized prior to the \fIfileName\fR argument.
.VE 8.5
.IP "\fB\-colormap \fInew\fR" 20
Specifies that the window should have a new private colormap instead of
using the default colormap for the screen.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 20
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 20
Initial geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its
value is stored in the \fBgeometry\fR global variable of the application's
Tcl interpreter.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 20
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 20
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-use\fR \fIid\fR" 20
Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded in
the window whose identifier is \fIid\fR, instead of being created as an
independent toplevel window.  \fIId\fR must be specified in the same
way as the value for the \fB\-use\fR option for toplevel widgets (i.e.
it has a form like that returned by the \fBwinfo id\fR command).
.RS
Note that on some platforms this will only work correctly if \fIid\fR
refers to a Tk \fBframe\fR or \fBtoplevel\fR that has its
\fB\-container\fR option enabled.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-visual \fIvisual\fR" 20
Specifies the visual to use for the window.
\fIVisual\fR may have any of the forms supported by the \fBTk_GetVisual\fR
procedure.
.IP "\fB\-\|\-\fR" 20
Pass all remaining arguments through to the script's \fBargv\fR
variable without interpreting them.
This provides a mechanism for passing arguments such as \fB\-name\fR
to a script instead of having \fBwish\fR interpret them.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBWish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands
from standard input or from a file.
It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.
If \fBwish\fR is invoked with arguments, then the first few
arguments, ?\fB\-encoding \fIname\fR? ?\fIfileName\fR? specify the
name of a script file, and, optionally, the
encoding of the text data stored in that script file.  A value
for \fIfileName\fR is recognized if the appropriate argument
does not start with
.QW \- .
.PP
If there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a \fIfileName\fR,
then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input.
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.
If there exists a file
.QW \fB.wishrc\fR
in the home directory of the user, \fBwish\fR evaluates the file as a
Tcl script just before reading the first command from standard input.
.PP
If arguments to \fBwish\fR do specify a \fIfileName\fR, then 
\fIfileName\fR is treated as the name of a script file.
\fBWish\fR will evaluate the script in \fIfileName\fR (which
presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to events
until all windows have been deleted.
Commands will not be read from standard input.
There is no automatic evaluation of
.QW \fB.wishrc\fR
when the name of a script file is presented on the \fBwish\fR command line,
but the script file can always \fBsource\fR it if desired.
.PP
Note that on Windows, the \fBwish\fIversion\fB.exe\fR program varies
from the \fBtclsh\fIversion\fB.exe\fR program in an additional
important way: it does not connect to a standard Windows console and
is instead a windowed program. Because of this, it additionally
provides access to its own \fBconsole\fR command.
.SH "OPTION PROCESSING"
.PP
\fBWish\fR automatically processes all of the command-line options
described in the \fBOPTIONS\fR summary above.
Any other command-line arguments besides these are passed through
to the application using the \fBargc\fR and \fBargv\fR variables
described later.
.SH "APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS"
.PP
The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
\fBsend\fR commands, is taken from the \fB\-name\fR option,
if it is specified;  otherwise it is taken from \fIfileName\fR,
if it is specified, or from the command name by which
\fBwish\fR was invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a
.QW /
character, then only the characters after the last slash are used
as the application name.
.PP
The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fR property or .Xdefaults
file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBWish\fR sets the following Tcl variables:
.TP 15
\fBargc\fR
Contains a count of the number of \fIarg\fR arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
.TP 15
\fBargv\fR
Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the \fIarg\fR arguments
that follow a \fB\-\|\-\fR option or do not match any of the
options described in \fBOPTIONS\fR above, in order, or an empty string
if there are no such arguments.
.TP 15
\fBargv0\fR
Contains \fIfileName\fR if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which \fBwish\fR was invoked.
.TP 15
\fBgeometry\fR
If the \fB\-geometry\fR option is specified, \fBwish\fR copies its
value into this variable.  If the variable still exists after
\fIfileName\fR has been evaluated, \fBwish\fR uses the value of
the variable in a \fBwm geometry\fR command to set the main
window's geometry.
.TP 15
\fBtcl_interactive\fR
Contains 1 if \fBwish\fR is reading commands interactively (\fIfileName\fR
was not specified and standard input is a terminal-like
device), 0 otherwise.
.SH "SCRIPT FILES"
.PP
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
.CS
\fB#!/usr/local/bin/wish\fR
.CE
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if
you mark it as executable.
This assumes that \fBwish\fR has been installed in the default
location in /usr/local/bin;  if it is installed somewhere else
then you will have to modify the above line to match.
Many UNIX systems do not allow the \fB#!\fR line to exceed about
30 characters in length, so be sure that the \fBwish\fR executable
can be accessed with a short file name.
.PP
An even better approach is to start your script files with the
following three lines:
.CS
\fB#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \e
exec wish "$0" "$@"\fR
.CE
This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous
paragraph.  First, the location of the \fBwish\fR binary does not have
to be hard-wired into the script:  it can be anywhere in your shell
search path.  Second, it gets around the 30-character file name limit
in the previous approach.
Third, this approach will work even if \fBwish\fR is
itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in order to
handle multiple architectures or operating systems:  the \fBwish\fR
script selects one of several binaries to run).  The three lines
cause both \fBsh\fR and \fBwish\fR to process the script, but the
\fBexec\fR is only executed by \fBsh\fR.
\fBsh\fR processes the script first;  it treats the second
line as a comment and executes the third line.
The \fBexec\fR statement cause the shell to stop processing and
instead to start up \fBwish\fR to reprocess the entire script.
When \fBwish\fR starts up, it treats all three lines as comments,
since the backslash at the end of the second line causes the third
line to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.
.PP
The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of
the medium, or by the character,
.QW \e032
.PQ \eu001a ", control-Z" .
If this character is present in the file, the \fBwish\fR application
will read text up to but not including the character.  An application
that requires this character in the file may encode it as
.QW \e032 ,
.QW \ex1a ,
or
.QW \eu001a ;
or may generate it by use of commands such as \fBformat\fR or \fBbinary\fR.
.SH PROMPTS
.PP
When \fBwish\fR is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with
.QW "\fB% \fR" .
You can change the prompt by setting the
variables \fBtcl_prompt1\fR and \fBtcl_prompt2\fR.  If variable
\fBtcl_prompt1\fR exists then it must consist of a Tcl script
to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt \fBwish\fR
will evaluate the script in \fBtcl_prompt1\fR.
The variable \fBtcl_prompt2\fR is used in a similar way when
a newline is typed but the current command is not yet complete;
if \fBtcl_prompt2\fR is not set then no prompt is output for
incomplete commands.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm write
.Nd send a message to another user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar user
.Op Ar ttyname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows you to communicate with other users, by copying lines from
your terminal to theirs.
.Pp
When you run the
.Nm
command, the user you are writing to gets a message of the form:
.Pp
.Dl Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...
.Pp
Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's
terminal.
If the other user wants to reply, they must run
.Nm
as well.
.Pp
When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.
The other user will see the message
.Ql EOF
indicating that the
conversation is over.
.Pp
You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you
with the
.Xr mesg 1
command.
.Pp
If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal,
you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal
name as the second operand to the
.Nm
command.
Alternatively, you can let
.Nm
select one of the terminals \- it will pick the one with the shortest
idle time.
This is so that if the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from
home, the message will go to the right place.
.Pp
The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string
.Ql \-o ,
either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that it's the
other person's turn to talk.
The string
.Ql oo
means that the person believes the conversation to be
over.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBx509\fR command is a multi purpose certificate utility. It can be
used to display certificate information, convert certificates to
various forms, sign certificate requests like a \*(L"mini \s-1CA\*(R"\s0 or edit
certificate trust settings.
.PP
Since there are a large number of options they will split up into
various sections.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.SS "\s-1INPUT, OUTPUT AND GENERAL PURPOSE OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "INPUT, OUTPUT AND GENERAL PURPOSE OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM|NET\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM|NET"
This specifies the input format normally the command will expect an X509
certificate but this can change if other options such as \fB\-req\fR are
present. The \s-1DER\s0 format is the \s-1DER\s0 encoding of the certificate and \s-1PEM\s0
is the base64 encoding of the \s-1DER\s0 encoding with header and footer lines
added. The \s-1NET\s0 option is an obscure Netscape server format that is now
obsolete.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM|NET\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM|NET"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a certificate from or standard input
if this option is not specified.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
default.
.IP "\fB\-md2|\-md5|\-sha1|\-mdc2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-md2|-md5|-sha1|-mdc2"
the digest to use. This affects any signing or display option that uses a message
digest, such as the \fB\-fingerprint\fR, \fB\-signkey\fR and \fB\-CA\fR options. If not
specified then \s-1SHA1\s0 is used. If the key being used to sign with is a \s-1DSA\s0 key
then this option has no effect: \s-1SHA1\s0 is always used with \s-1DSA\s0 keys.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.SS "\s-1DISPLAY OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "DISPLAY OPTIONS"
Note: the \fB\-alias\fR and \fB\-purpose\fR options are also display options
but are described in the \fB\s-1TRUST SETTINGS\s0\fR section.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the certificate in text form. Full details are output including the
public key, signature algorithms, issuer and subject names, serial number
any extensions present and any trust settings.
.IP "\fB\-certopt option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-certopt option"
customise the output format used with \fB\-text\fR. The \fBoption\fR argument can be
a single option or multiple options separated by commas. The \fB\-certopt\fR switch
may be also be used more than once to set multiple options. See the \fB\s-1TEXT OPTIONS\s0\fR
section for more information.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the request.
.IP "\fB\-modulus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modulus"
this option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key
contained in the certificate.
.IP "\fB\-serial\fR" 4
.IX Item "-serial"
outputs the certificate serial number.
.IP "\fB\-subject_hash\fR" 4
.IX Item "-subject_hash"
outputs the \*(L"hash\*(R" of the certificate subject name. This is used in OpenSSL to
form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be looked up by subject
name.
.IP "\fB\-issuer_hash\fR" 4
.IX Item "-issuer_hash"
outputs the \*(L"hash\*(R" of the certificate issuer name.
.IP "\fB\-ocspid\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ocspid"
outputs the \s-1OCSP\s0 hash values for the subject name and public key.
.IP "\fB\-hash\fR" 4
.IX Item "-hash"
synonym for \*(L"\-subject_hash\*(R" for backward compatibility reasons.
.IP "\fB\-subject\fR" 4
.IX Item "-subject"
outputs the subject name.
.IP "\fB\-issuer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-issuer"
outputs the issuer name.
.IP "\fB\-nameopt option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nameopt option"
option which determines how the subject or issuer names are displayed. The
\&\fBoption\fR argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by
commas.  Alternatively the \fB\-nameopt\fR switch may be used more than once to
set multiple options. See the \fB\s-1NAME OPTIONS\s0\fR section for more information.
.IP "\fB\-email\fR" 4
.IX Item "-email"
outputs the email address(es) if any.
.IP "\fB\-startdate\fR" 4
.IX Item "-startdate"
prints out the start date of the certificate, that is the notBefore date.
.IP "\fB\-enddate\fR" 4
.IX Item "-enddate"
prints out the expiry date of the certificate, that is the notAfter date.
.IP "\fB\-dates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dates"
prints out the start and expiry dates of a certificate.
.IP "\fB\-checkend arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-checkend arg"
checks if the certificate expires within the next \fBarg\fR seconds and exits
non-zero if yes it will expire or zero if not.
.IP "\fB\-fingerprint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fingerprint"
prints out the digest of the \s-1DER\s0 encoded version of the whole certificate
(see digest options).
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
this outputs the certificate in the form of a C source file.
.SS "\s-1TRUST SETTINGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TRUST SETTINGS"
Please note these options are currently experimental and may well change.
.PP
A \fBtrusted certificate\fR is an ordinary certificate which has several
additional pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted
and prohibited uses of the certificate and an \*(L"alias\*(R".

Normally when a certificate is being verified at least one certificate
must be \*(L"trusted\*(R". By default a trusted certificate must be stored
locally and must be a root \s-1CA:\s0 any certificate chain ending in this \s-1CA\s0
is then usable for any purpose.
.PP
Trust settings currently are only used with a root \s-1CA.\s0 They allow a finer
control over the purposes the root \s-1CA\s0 can be used for. For example a \s-1CA\s0
may be trusted for \s-1SSL\s0 client but not \s-1SSL\s0 server use.
.PP
See the description of the \fBverify\fR utility for more information on the
meaning of trust settings.
.PP
Future versions of OpenSSL will recognize trust settings on any
certificate: not just root CAs.
.IP "\fB\-trustout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trustout"
this causes \fBx509\fR to output a \fBtrusted\fR certificate. An ordinary
or trusted certificate can be input but by default an ordinary
certificate is output and any trust settings are discarded. With the
\&\fB\-trustout\fR option a trusted certificate is output. A trusted
certificate is automatically output if any trust settings are modified.
.IP "\fB\-setalias arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-setalias arg"
sets the alias of the certificate. This will allow the certificate
to be referred to using a nickname for example \*(L"Steve's Certificate\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-alias\fR" 4
.IX Item "-alias"
outputs the certificate alias, if any.
.IP "\fB\-clrtrust\fR" 4
.IX Item "-clrtrust"
clears all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.
.IP "\fB\-clrreject\fR" 4
.IX Item "-clrreject"
clears all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.
.IP "\fB\-addtrust arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-addtrust arg"
adds a trusted certificate use. Any object name can be used here
but currently only \fBclientAuth\fR (\s-1SSL\s0 client use), \fBserverAuth\fR
(\s-1SSL\s0 server use) and \fBemailProtection\fR (S/MIME email) are used.
Other OpenSSL applications may define additional uses.
.IP "\fB\-addreject arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-addreject arg"
adds a prohibited use. It accepts the same values as the \fB\-addtrust\fR
option.
.IP "\fB\-purpose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-purpose"
this option performs tests on the certificate extensions and outputs
the results. For a more complete description see the \fB\s-1CERTIFICATE
EXTENSIONS\s0\fR section.
.SS "\s-1SIGNING OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "SIGNING OPTIONS"
The \fBx509\fR utility can be used to sign certificates and requests: it
can thus behave like a \*(L"mini \s-1CA\*(R".\s0
.IP "\fB\-signkey filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-signkey filename"
this option causes the input file to be self signed using the supplied
private key.
.Sp
If the input file is a certificate it sets the issuer name to the
subject name (i.e.  makes it self signed) changes the public key to the
supplied value and changes the start and end dates. The start date is
set to the current time and the end date is set to a value determined
by the \fB\-days\fR option. Any certificate extensions are retained unless
the \fB\-clrext\fR option is supplied.
.Sp
If the input is a certificate request then a self signed certificate
is created using the supplied private key using the subject name in
the request.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the key password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-clrext\fR" 4
.IX Item "-clrext"
delete any extensions from a certificate. This option is used when a
certificate is being created from another certificate (for example with
the \fB\-signkey\fR or the \fB\-CA\fR options). Normally all extensions are
retained.
.IP "\fB\-keyform PEM|DER\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyform PEM|DER"
specifies the format (\s-1DER\s0 or \s-1PEM\s0) of the private key file used in the
\&\fB\-signkey\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-days arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-days arg"
specifies the number of days to make a certificate valid for. The default
is 30 days.
.IP "\fB\-x509toreq\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x509toreq"
converts a certificate into a certificate request. The \fB\-signkey\fR option
is used to pass the required private key.
.IP "\fB\-req\fR" 4
.IX Item "-req"
by default a certificate is expected on input. With this option a
certificate request is expected instead.
.IP "\fB\-set_serial n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-set_serial n"
specifies the serial number to use. This option can be used with either
the \fB\-signkey\fR or \fB\-CA\fR options. If used in conjunction with the \fB\-CA\fR
option the serial number file (as specified by the \fB\-CAserial\fR or
\&\fB\-CAcreateserial\fR options) is not used.
.Sp
The serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by \fB0x\fR). Negative
serial numbers can also be specified but their use is not recommended.
.IP "\fB\-CA filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CA filename"
specifies the \s-1CA\s0 certificate to be used for signing. When this option is
present \fBx509\fR behaves like a \*(L"mini \s-1CA\*(R".\s0 The input file is signed by this
\&\s-1CA\s0 using this option: that is its issuer name is set to the subject name
of the \s-1CA\s0 and it is digitally signed using the CAs private key.
.Sp
This option is normally combined with the \fB\-req\fR option. Without the
\&\fB\-req\fR option the input is a certificate which must be self signed.
.IP "\fB\-CAkey filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAkey filename"
sets the \s-1CA\s0 private key to sign a certificate with. If this option is
not specified then it is assumed that the \s-1CA\s0 private key is present in
the \s-1CA\s0 certificate file.
.IP "\fB\-CAserial filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAserial filename"
sets the \s-1CA\s0 serial number file to use.
.Sp
When the \fB\-CA\fR option is used to sign a certificate it uses a serial
number specified in a file. This file consist of one line containing
an even number of hex digits with the serial number to use. After each
use the serial number is incremented and written out to the file again.
.Sp
The default filename consists of the \s-1CA\s0 certificate file base name with
\&\*(L".srl\*(R" appended. For example if the \s-1CA\s0 certificate file is called 
\&\*(L"mycacert.pem\*(R" it expects to find a serial number file called \*(L"mycacert.srl\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-CAcreateserial\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAcreateserial"
with this option the \s-1CA\s0 serial number file is created if it does not exist:
it will contain the serial number \*(L"02\*(R" and the certificate being signed will
have the 1 as its serial number. Normally if the \fB\-CA\fR option is specified
and the serial number file does not exist it is an error.
.IP "\fB\-extfile filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-extfile filename"
file containing certificate extensions to use. If not specified then
no extensions are added to the certificate.
.IP "\fB\-extensions section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-extensions section"
the section to add certificate extensions from. If this option is not
specified then the extensions should either be contained in the unnamed
(default) section or the default section should contain a variable called
\&\*(L"extensions\*(R" which contains the section to use.
.SS "\s-1NAME OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "NAME OPTIONS"
The \fBnameopt\fR command line switch determines how the subject and issuer
names are displayed. If no \fBnameopt\fR switch is present the default \*(L"oneline\*(R"
format is used which is compatible with previous versions of OpenSSL.
Each option is described in detail below, all options can be preceded by
a \fB\-\fR to turn the option off. Only the first four will normally be used.
.IP "\fBcompat\fR" 4
.IX Item "compat"
use the old format. This is equivalent to specifying no name options at all.
.IP "\fB\s-1RFC2253\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "RFC2253"
displays names compatible with \s-1RFC2253\s0 equivalent to \fBesc_2253\fR, \fBesc_ctrl\fR,
\&\fBesc_msb\fR, \fButf8\fR, \fBdump_nostr\fR, \fBdump_unknown\fR, \fBdump_der\fR,
\&\fBsep_comma_plus\fR, \fBdn_rev\fR and \fBsname\fR.
.IP "\fBoneline\fR" 4
.IX Item "oneline"
a oneline format which is more readable than \s-1RFC2253.\s0 It is equivalent to
specifying the  \fBesc_2253\fR, \fBesc_ctrl\fR, \fBesc_msb\fR, \fButf8\fR, \fBdump_nostr\fR,
\&\fBdump_der\fR, \fBuse_quote\fR, \fBsep_comma_plus_space\fR, \fBspace_eq\fR and \fBsname\fR
options.
.IP "\fBmultiline\fR" 4
.IX Item "multiline"
a multiline format. It is equivalent \fBesc_ctrl\fR, \fBesc_msb\fR, \fBsep_multiline\fR,
\&\fBspace_eq\fR, \fBlname\fR and \fBalign\fR.
.IP "\fBesc_2253\fR" 4
.IX Item "esc_2253"
escape the \*(L"special\*(R" characters required by \s-1RFC2253\s0 in a field That is
\&\fB,+"<>;\fR. Additionally \fB#\fR is escaped at the beginning of a string
and a space character at the beginning or end of a string.
.IP "\fBesc_ctrl\fR" 4
.IX Item "esc_ctrl"
escape control characters. That is those with \s-1ASCII\s0 values less than
0x20 (space) and the delete (0x7f) character. They are escaped using the
\&\s-1RFC2253\s0 \eXX notation (where \s-1XX\s0 are two hex digits representing the
character value).
.IP "\fBesc_msb\fR" 4
.IX Item "esc_msb"
escape characters with the \s-1MSB\s0 set, that is with \s-1ASCII\s0 values larger than
127.
.IP "\fBuse_quote\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_quote"
escapes some characters by surrounding the whole string with \fB"\fR characters,
without the option all escaping is done with the \fB\e\fR character.
.IP "\fButf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "utf8"
convert all strings to \s-1UTF8\s0 format first. This is required by \s-1RFC2253.\s0 If
you are lucky enough to have a \s-1UTF8\s0 compatible terminal then the use
of this option (and \fBnot\fR setting \fBesc_msb\fR) may result in the correct
display of multibyte (international) characters. Is this option is not
present then multibyte characters larger than 0xff will be represented
using the format \eUXXXX for 16 bits and \eWXXXXXXXX for 32 bits.
Also if this option is off any UTF8Strings will be converted to their
character form first.
.IP "\fBignore_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "ignore_type"
this option does not attempt to interpret multibyte characters in any
way. That is their content octets are merely dumped as though one octet
represents each character. This is useful for diagnostic purposes but
will result in rather odd looking output.
.IP "\fBshow_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "show_type"
show the type of the \s-1ASN1\s0 character string. The type precedes the
field contents. For example \*(L"\s-1BMPSTRING:\s0 Hello World\*(R".
.IP "\fBdump_der\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_der"
when this option is set any fields that need to be hexdumped will
be dumped using the \s-1DER\s0 encoding of the field. Otherwise just the
content octets will be displayed. Both options use the \s-1RFC2253
\&\s0\fB#XXXX...\fR format.
.IP "\fBdump_nostr\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_nostr"
dump non character string types (for example \s-1OCTET STRING\s0) if this
option is not set then non character string types will be displayed
as though each content octet represents a single character.
.IP "\fBdump_all\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_all"
dump all fields. This option when used with \fBdump_der\fR allows the
\&\s-1DER\s0 encoding of the structure to be unambiguously determined.
.IP "\fBdump_unknown\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_unknown"
dump any field whose \s-1OID\s0 is not recognised by OpenSSL.
.IP "\fBsep_comma_plus\fR, \fBsep_comma_plus_space\fR, \fBsep_semi_plus_space\fR, \fBsep_multiline\fR" 4
.IX Item "sep_comma_plus, sep_comma_plus_space, sep_semi_plus_space, sep_multiline"
these options determine the field separators. The first character is
between RDNs and the second between multiple AVAs (multiple AVAs are
very rare and their use is discouraged). The options ending in
\&\*(L"space\*(R" additionally place a space after the separator to make it
more readable. The \fBsep_multiline\fR uses a linefeed character for
the \s-1RDN\s0 separator and a spaced \fB+\fR for the \s-1AVA\s0 separator. It also
indents the fields by four characters.
.IP "\fBdn_rev\fR" 4
.IX Item "dn_rev"
reverse the fields of the \s-1DN.\s0 This is required by \s-1RFC2253.\s0 As a side
effect this also reverses the order of multiple AVAs but this is
permissible.
.IP "\fBnofname\fR, \fBsname\fR, \fBlname\fR, \fBoid\fR" 4
.IX Item "nofname, sname, lname, oid"
these options alter how the field name is displayed. \fBnofname\fR does
not display the field at all. \fBsname\fR uses the \*(L"short name\*(R" form
(\s-1CN\s0 for commonName for example). \fBlname\fR uses the long form.
\&\fBoid\fR represents the \s-1OID\s0 in numerical form and is useful for
diagnostic purpose.
.IP "\fBalign\fR" 4
.IX Item "align"
align field values for a more readable output. Only usable with
\&\fBsep_multiline\fR.
.IP "\fBspace_eq\fR" 4
.IX Item "space_eq"
places spaces round the \fB=\fR character which follows the field
name.
.SS "\s-1TEXT OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TEXT OPTIONS"
As well as customising the name output format, it is also possible to
customise the actual fields printed using the \fBcertopt\fR options when
the \fBtext\fR option is present. The default behaviour is to print all fields.
.IP "\fBcompatible\fR" 4
.IX Item "compatible"
use the old format. This is equivalent to specifying no output options at all.
.IP "\fBno_header\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_header"
don't print header information: that is the lines saying \*(L"Certificate\*(R" and \*(L"Data\*(R".
.IP "\fBno_version\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_version"
don't print out the version number.
.IP "\fBno_serial\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_serial"
don't print out the serial number.
.IP "\fBno_signame\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_signame"
don't print out the signature algorithm used.
.IP "\fBno_validity\fR" 4

.IP "\fBno_subject\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_subject"
don't print out the subject name.
.IP "\fBno_issuer\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_issuer"
don't print out the issuer name.
.IP "\fBno_pubkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_pubkey"
don't print out the public key.
.IP "\fBno_sigdump\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_sigdump"
don't give a hexadecimal dump of the certificate signature.
.IP "\fBno_aux\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_aux"

.IP "\fBno_extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_extensions"
don't print out any X509V3 extensions.
.IP "\fBext_default\fR" 4

.IP "\fBca_default\fR" 4
.IX Item "ca_default"
the value used by the \fBca\fR utility, equivalent to \fBno_issuer\fR, \fBno_pubkey\fR, \fBno_header\fR,

The conversion to \s-1UTF8\s0 format used with the name options assumes that
T61Strings use the \s-1ISO8859\-1\s0 character set. This is wrong but Netscape
and \s-1MSIE\s0 do this as do many certificates. So although this is incorrect
it is more likely to display the majority of certificates correctly.
.PP
The \fB\-fingerprint\fR option takes the digest of the \s-1DER\s0 encoded certificate.
This is commonly called a \*(L"fingerprint\*(R". Because of the nature of message
digests the fingerprint of a certificate is unique to that certificate and
two certificates with the same fingerprint can be considered to be the same.
.PP
The Netscape fingerprint uses \s-1MD5\s0 whereas \s-1MSIE\s0 uses \s-1SHA1.\s0

The \fB\-email\fR option searches the subject name and the subject alternative

not print the same address more than once.
.SH "CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS"
.IX Header "CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS"
The \fB\-purpose\fR option checks the certificate extensions and determines
what the certificate can be used for. The actual checks done are rather
complex and include various hacks and workarounds to handle broken
certificates and software.
.PP
The same code is used when verifying untrusted certificates in chains
so this section is useful if a chain is rejected by the verify code.
.PP
The basicConstraints extension \s-1CA\s0 flag is used to determine whether the
certificate can be used as a \s-1CA.\s0 If the \s-1CA\s0 flag is true then it is a \s-1CA,\s0
if the \s-1CA\s0 flag is false then it is not a \s-1CA. \s0\fBAll\fR CAs should have the
\&\s-1CA\s0 flag set to true.
.PP
If the basicConstraints extension is absent then the certificate is
considered to be a \*(L"possible \s-1CA\*(R"\s0 other extensions are checked according
to the intended use of the certificate. A warning is given in this case
because the certificate should really not be regarded as a \s-1CA:\s0 however
it is allowed to be a \s-1CA\s0 to work around some broken software.
.PP
If the certificate is a V1 certificate (and thus has no extensions) and
it is self signed it is also assumed to be a \s-1CA\s0 but a warning is again
given: this is to work around the problem of Verisign roots which are V1
self signed certificates.
.PP
If the keyUsage extension is present then additional restraints are
made on the uses of the certificate. A \s-1CA\s0 certificate \fBmust\fR have the
keyCertSign bit set if the keyUsage extension is present.
.PP
The extended key usage extension places additional restrictions on the
certificate uses. If this extension is present (whether critical or not)
the key can only be used for the purposes specified.

The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the \*(L"web server
authentication\*(R" and/or one of the \s-1SGC\s0 OIDs.  Netscape certificate type must
be absent or the \s-1SSL CA\s0 bit must be set: this is used as a work around if the
basicConstraints extension is absent.
.IP "\fBNetscape \s-1SSL\s0 Server\fR" 4
.IX Item "Netscape SSL Server"
For Netscape \s-1SSL\s0 clients to connect to an \s-1SSL\s0 server it must have the
keyEncipherment bit set if the keyUsage extension is present. This isn't
always valid because some cipher suites use the key for digital signing.
Otherwise it is the same as a normal \s-1SSL\s0 server.
.IP "\fBCommon S/MIME Client Tests\fR" 4
.IX Item "Common S/MIME Client Tests"
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the \*(L"email
protection\*(R" \s-1OID.\s0 Netscape certificate type must be absent or should have the
S/MIME bit set. If the S/MIME bit is not set in netscape certificate type
then the \s-1SSL\s0 client bit is tolerated as an alternative but a warning is shown:
this is because some Verisign certificates don't set the S/MIME bit.
.IP "\fBS/MIME Signing\fR" 4

dates rather than an offset from the current time.

The code to implement the verify behaviour described in the \fB\s-1TRUST SETTINGS\s0\fR
is currently being developed. It thus describes the intended behaviour rather
than the current behaviour. It is hoped that it will represent reality in
OpenSSL 0.9.5 and later.

.SH NAME
xar \- eXtensible ARchiver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xar
\-[\fIctx\fR][\fIv\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format. Important
design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of contents (TOC) for
random access to archived files, storing the TOC at the beginning of the
archive to allow for efficient handling of streamed archives, the ability to
handle files of arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to choose independent
encodings for individual files in the archive, the ability to store checksums
for individual files in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability
to query the table of content's rich meta-data.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B One of the following options must be used:
.TP
\-c
Creates an archive
.TP
\-t
Lists the contents of an archive
.TP
\-x
Extracts an archive
.TP
.B NOTE: all of the above require the use of the -f option (filename) as this release of xar doesn't correctly handle pipes or sockets.
.TP
\-f
The filename to use for creation, listing or extraction.  With extraction, this can be a POSIX regular expression.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-compression
Specifies the compression type to use.
Valid values: none, gzip, bzip2, lzma (on some systems).  Default value: gzip
.TP
\-C <path>
On extract, xar will chdir to the specified path before extracting the archive.
.TP
\-a
Synonym for \-\-compression=lzma
.TP
\-j
Synonym for \-\-compression=bzip2
.TP
\-z
Synonym for \-\-compression=gzip
.TP
\-\-compression-args=<arguments>
Specifies arguments to the compression engine selected.
gzip, bzip2, and lzma all take a single integer argument between 0 and 9 specifying the compression level to use.
.TP
\-\-dump\-toc=<filename>
Has xar dump the xml header into the specified file.  "-" can be specified to mean stdout.
.TP
\-\-dump\-header
Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.
.TP
\-\-extract\-subdoc=<name> 
Extracts the specified subdocument to a document in cwd named <name>.xml
.TP
\-\-list\-subdocs
List the subdocuments in the xml header
.TP
\-\-toc\-cksum
Specifies the hashing algorithm to use for xml header verification.
Valid values: none, md5 (on some systems), sha1, sha256, and sha512.  Default value: sha1
.TP
\-\-file\-cksum
Specifies the hashing algorithm to use for file content verification.
Valid values: none, md5 (on some systems), sha1, sha256, and sha512.  Default value: sha1
.TP
\-l
On archival, stay on the local device.
.TP
\-P
On extract, set ownership based on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can be set
on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits will also be preserved.
.TP
\-p
On extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.  
If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits 
will also be preserved.
.TP
\-s <filename>
On extract, specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.
On archival, specifies an xml file to add as a subdocument.
.TP
\-v
Verbose output
.TP
\-\-exclude
Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files to exclude from adding to
the archive during creation or from being extracted during extraction.  
This option can be specified multiple times.
.TP
\-\-rsize
Specifies a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer while performing I/O.
.TP
\-\-coalesce-heap
When multiple files in the archive are identical, only store one copy of the data in the heap.  This creates smaller archives, but the archives created are not streamable.
.TP
\-\-link-same
When the data section of multiple files are identical, hardlink them within the archive.
.TP
\-\-no-compress
Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files to archive, but not compress.  The archived files will be copied raw into the archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from being gzipped during the archival process.
.TP
\-\-prop-include
Specifies a file property to be included in the archive.  When this option is specified, only the specified options will be included.  Anything not specifically included with this option will be omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.
.TP
\-\-prop-exclude
Specifies a file property to be excluded from the archive.  When this option is specified, all file properties will be included except the specified properties.  This option can be used multiple times.
.TP
\-\-distribution
Creates an archive to only contain file properties safe for file distribution.  Currently, only name, type, mode, and data are preserved with this option.
.TP
\-\-keep-existing
Does not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps any previously existing files while extracting.
.TP
\-k
Synonym for \-\-keep-existing.
.TP
\-\-keep-setuid
When extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files as the
uid/gid of the extracting process.  In this situation, xar will strip
setuid/setgid bits from the extracted files for security reasons.
\-\-keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid bits even though the
uid/gid of the extracted file is not the same as the archived file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
xar -cf sample.xar /home/uid
Create a xar archive of all files in /home/uid
.TP
xar -tf sample.xar
List the contents of the xar archive sample.xar
.TP
xar -xf sample.xar
Extract the contents of sample.xar to the current working directory
.SH BUGS
.TP
Doesn't currently work with pipes or streams.  Might be fixed in a future release.
.TP
Probably one or two more somewhere in there. If you find one please report it to http://code.google.com/p/xar/

.Sh NAME
.Nm xargs
.Nd "construct argument list(s) and execute utility"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 0opt
.Op Fl E Ar eofstr
.Oo
.Fl I Ar replstr
.Op Fl R Ar replacements
.Oc
.Op Fl J Ar replstr
.Op Fl L Ar number
.Oo
.Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl x
.Oc
.Op Fl P Ar maxprocs
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Op Ar utility Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited strings
from the standard input and executes
.Ar utility
with the strings as
arguments.
.Pp
Any arguments specified on the command line are given to
.Ar utility
upon each invocation, followed by some number of the arguments read
from the standard input of
.Nm .
The utility
is repeatedly executed until standard input is exhausted.
.Pp
Spaces, tabs and newlines may be embedded in arguments using single
(``\ '\ '')
or double (``"'') quotes or backslashes (``\e'').
Single quotes escape all non-single quote characters, excluding newlines,
up to the matching single quote.
Double quotes escape all non-double quote characters, excluding newlines,
up to the matching double quote.
Any single character, including newlines, may be escaped by a backslash.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 0
Change
.Nm
to expect NUL
(``\\0'')
characters as separators, instead of spaces and newlines.
This is expected to be used in concert with the
.Fl print0
function in
.Xr find 1 .
.It Fl E Ar eofstr
Use
.Ar eofstr
as a logical EOF marker.
.It Fl I Ar replstr
Execute
.Ar utility
for each input line, replacing one or more occurrences of
.Ar replstr
in up to
.Ar replacements
(or 5 if no
.Fl R
flag is specified) arguments to
.Ar utility
with the entire line of input.
The resulting arguments, after replacement is done, will not be allowed to grow
beyond 255 bytes; this is implemented by concatenating as much of the argument
containing
.Ar replstr
as possible, to the constructed arguments to
.Ar utility ,
up to 255 bytes.
The 255 byte limit does not apply to arguments to
.Ar utility
which do not contain
.Ar replstr ,
and furthermore, no replacement will be done on
.Ar utility
itself.
Implies
.Fl x .
.It Fl J Ar replstr
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will use the data read from standard input to replace the first occurrence of
.Ar replstr
instead of appending that data after all other arguments.
This option will not affect how many arguments will be read from input
.Pq Fl n ,
or the size of the command(s)
.Nm
will generate
.Pq Fl s .
The option just moves where those arguments will be placed in the command(s)
that are executed.
The
.Ar replstr
must show up as a distinct
.Ar argument
to
.Nm .
It will not be recognized if, for instance, it is in the middle of a
quoted string.
Furthermore, only the first occurrence of the
.Ar replstr
will be replaced.
For example, the following command will copy the list of files and
directories which start with an uppercase letter in the current
directory to
.Pa destdir :
.Pp
.Dl /bin/ls -1d [A-Z]* | xargs -J % cp -rp % destdir
.Pp
.It Fl L Ar number
Call
.Ar utility
for every
.Ar number
non-empty lines read.
A line ending with a space continues to the next non-empty line.
If EOF is reached and fewer lines have been read than
.Ar number
then
.Ar utility
will be called with the available lines.
The
.Fl L
and
.Fl n
options are mutually-exclusive; the last one given will be used.
.It Fl n Ar number
Set the maximum number of arguments taken from standard input for each
invocation of
.Ar utility .
An invocation of
.Ar utility
will use less than
.Ar number
standard input arguments if the number of bytes accumulated (see the
.Fl s
option) exceeds the specified
.Ar size
or there are fewer than
.Ar number
arguments remaining for the last invocation of
.Ar utility .
The current default value for
.Ar number
is 5000.
.It Fl o
Reopen stdin as
.Pa /dev/tty
in the child process before executing the command.
This is useful if you want
.Nm
to run an interactive application.
.It Fl P Ar maxprocs
Parallel mode: run at most
.Ar maxprocs
invocations of
.Ar utility
at once.
.It Fl p
Echo each command to be executed and ask the user whether it should be
executed.
An affirmative response,
.Ql y
in the POSIX locale,
causes the command to be executed, any other response causes it to be
skipped.
No commands are executed if the process is not attached to a terminal.
.It Fl R Ar replacements
Specify the maximum number of arguments that
.Fl I
will do replacement in.
If
.Ar replacements
is negative, the number of arguments in which to replace is unbounded.
.It Fl s Ar size
Set the maximum number of bytes for the command line length provided to
.Ar utility .
The sum of the length of the utility name, the arguments passed to
.Ar utility
(including
.Dv NULL
terminators) and the current environment will be less than or equal to
this number.
The current default value for
.Ar size
is
.Dv ARG_MAX
- 4096.
.It Fl t
Echo the command to be executed to standard error immediately before it
is executed.
.It Fl x
Force
.Nm
to terminate immediately if a command line containing
.Ar number
arguments will not fit in the specified (or default) command line length.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar utility
is omitted,
.Xr echo 1
is used.
.Pp
Undefined behavior may occur if
.Ar utility
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits immediately (without processing any further input) if a
command line cannot be assembled,
.Ar utility
cannot be invoked, an invocation of
.Ar utility
is terminated by a signal,
or an invocation of
.Ar utility
exits with a value of 255.
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
In legacy mode, the
.Fl L
option treats all newlines as end-of-line, regardless of whether
the line is empty or ends with a space.
In addition, the
.Fl L
and
.Fl n
options are not mutually-exclusive.
.Pp
For more information about legacy mode, see
.Xr compat 5 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a value of 0 if no error occurs.
If
.Ar utility
cannot be found,
.Nm
exits with a value of 127, otherwise if
.Ar utility
cannot be executed,
.Nm
exits with a value of 126.
If any other error occurs,
.Nm
exits with a value of 1.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr echo 1 ,
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr execvp 3 ,
.Xr compat 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compliant.
The
.Fl J , o , P
and
.Fl R
options are non-standard
.Fx
extensions which may not be available on other operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in PWB UNIX.
.Sh BUGS
If
.Ar utility
attempts to invoke another command such that the number of arguments or the
size of the environment is increased, it risks
.Xr execvp 3
failing with
.Er E2BIG .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not take multibyte characters into account when performing
string comparisons for the
.Fl I
and
.Fl J
options, which may lead to incorrect results in some locales.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to display, modify or remove the extended attributes
of one or more files, including directories and symbolic links.
Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file, but separate
from the filesystem attributes (such as modification time or file size).
The metadata is often a null-terminated UTF-8 string, but can also be arbitrary
binary data.
.Pp
One or more files may be specified on the command line.
For the first two forms of the command, when there are more than one file,
the file name is displayed along with the actual results.
When only one file is specified, the display of the file name is usually
suppressed (unless the
.Fl v
option described below, is also specified).
.Pp
In the first form of the command (without any other mode option specified),
the names of all extended attributes are listed.
Attribute names can also be displayed using
.Dq Li ls -l@ .
.Pp
In the second form, using the
.Fl p
option
.Pq Dq print ,
the value associated with the given attribute name is displayed.
Attribute values are usually displayed as strings.
However, if nils are detected
in the data, the value is displayed in a hexadecimal representation.
.Pp
The third form, with the
.Fl w
option
.Pq Dq write ,
causes the given attribute name to be assigned the given value.
.Pp
The fourth form, with the
.Fl d
option
.Pq Dq delete ,
causes the given attribute name (and associated value), to be removed.
.Pp
In the fifth form, with the
.Fl c
option
.Pq Dq clear ,
causes all attributes (including their associated values), to be removed.
.Pp
Finally, the last form, with either the
.Fl h
or
.Fl -help
option, displays a short help message and exits immediately.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl l
By default, the first two command forms either displays just the attribute
names or values, respectively.
The
.Fl l
option causes both the attribute names and corresponding values to be displayed.
For hexadecimal display of values,
the output is preceeded with the hexadecimal offset values and
followed by ASCII display, enclosed by
.Dq | .
.It Fl r
If a file argument is a directory, act as if the entire contents of the
directory recursively were also specified (so that every file in the directory
tree is acted upon).
.It Fl s
If a file argument is a symbolic link, act on the symbolic link itself, rather
than the file that the symbolic link points at.
.It Fl v
Force the the file name to be displayed, even for a single file.
.It Fl x
Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal representation.
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option normally assumes the input attribute value is a string.
Specifying the
.Fl x
option causes
.Nm
to expect the input in hexadecimal (whitespace is ignored).
The
.Xr xxd 1
command can be used to create hexadecimal representations from exising
binary data, to pass to
.Nm .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command exits with zero status on success.
On error, non-zero is returned, and an error message is printed to the standard
error.
For system call errors, both the error code and error string are printed (see
.Xr getxattr 2 ,
.Xr listxattr 2 ,
.Xr removexattr 2
and
.Xr setxattr 2
for a complete list of possible error codes).
.Pp
Some attribute data may have a fixed length that is enforced by the system.
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% xattr -w com.apple.FinderInfo 0 foo
xattr: [Errno 34] Result too large: 'foo'
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Li com.apple.FinderInfo
attribute must be 32 bytes in length.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example copies the
.Li com.apple.FinderInfo
attribute from the
.Li /usr
directory to the
.Li MyDir
directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

% xattr -l MyDir
% xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \\
  "`xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr`" MyDir
% xattr -l MyDir
com.apple.FinderInfo:
00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |........@.......|

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBxcode\-select\fP [\-h|\-\-help] [\-s|\-\-switch <path>] [\-p|\-\-print\-path]
[\-v|\-\-version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBxcode\-select\fP controls the location of the developer directory used by
\fIxcrun(1)\fP, \fIxcodebuild(1)\fP, \fIcc(1)\fP, and other Xcode
and BSD development tools. This also controls the locations that are searched
for by \fIman(1)\fP for developer tool manpages.
.sp
This allows you to easily switch between different versions of the Xcode tools
and can be used to update the path to the Xcode if it is moved after
installation.
.SS Usage
.sp
When multiple Xcode applications are installed on a system
(e.g. \fB/Applications/Xcode.app\fP, containing the latest Xcode, and
\fB/Applications/Xcode\-DP.app\fP containing a developer preview) use
\fBxcode\-select \-\-switch path/to/Xcode.app\fP to specify the Xcode that you
wish to use for command line developer tools.
.sp
After setting a developer directory, all of the \fBxcode\-select\fP provided
developer tool shims (see \fI\%FILES\fP) will automatically invoke the version of
the tool inside the selected developer directory. Your own scripts, makefiles,
and other tools can also use \fIxcrun(1)\fP to easily lookup tools inside
the active developer directory, making it easy to switch them between different
versions of the Xcode tools and allowing them to function properly on systems
where the Xcode application has been installed to a non\-default location.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Prints the usage message.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s <path>, \-\-switch <path>
Sets the active developer directory to the given path, for example
\fB/Applications/Xcode\-DP.app\fP\&. This command must be run with superuser
permissions (see \fIsudo(8)\fP), and will affect all users on the
system. To set the path without superuser permissions or only for the current
shell session, use the DEVELOPER_DIR environment variable instead (see
\fI\%ENVIRONMENT\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-print\-path
Prints the path to the currently selected developer directory. This is useful
for inspection, but scripts and other tools should use \fIxcrun(1)\fP to
locate tool inside the active developer directory.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-reset
Unsets any user\-specified developer directory, so that the developer directory
will be found via the default search mechanism. This command must be run with
superuser permissions (see \fIsudo(8)\fP), and will affect all users on
the system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Prints \fBxcode\-select\fP version information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-install
Opens a user interface dialog to request automatic installation of the command
line developer tools.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
DEVELOPER_DIR
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Overrides the active developer directory. When DEVELOPER_DIR is set, its value
will be used instead of the system\-wide active developer directory.
.sp
Note that for historical reason, the developer directory is considered to be
the Developer content directory inside the Xcode application (for example
\fB/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\fP). You can set the environment
variable to either the actual Developer contents directory, or the Xcode
application directory \-\- the \fBxcode\-select\fP provided shims will
automatically convert the environment variable into the full Developer content
path.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBxcode\-select \-\-switch /Applications/Xcode.app\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
As above, selects \fB/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\fP as the active
developer directory. The Developer content directory is automatically inferred
by \fBxcode\-select\fP\&.

.\"																				DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool archives one or more files or directories into a signed XIP file. A XIP file is
an analog to 
.Xr zip 1 ,
but allows for a digital signature to be applied and verified on the receiving system,
before the archive is expanded. When a XIP file is opened (by double-clicking), Archive
Utility will automatically expand it (but only if the digital signature is intact).
.Pp
To create a XIP file,
you will need to have a certificate and corresponding private key -- together called an
.Dq identity
-- in one of your accessible keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the identity using the
.Cm --sign
option. The identity's name is the same as the
.Dq Common Name
of the certificate.
.Pp
If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify the path to the
keychain file using the 
.Cm --keychain
option. Otherwise, the default keychain search path is used.
.Pp
.Nm
will embed the signing certificate in the XIP file, as well as any intermediate
certificates that are found in the keychain. 
.Pp
The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled by default when signing with
a Developer ID identity, but it can be enabled explicitly using the
.Cm --timestamp 
option. A timestamp server must be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't
connected to the Internet, you can use
.Cm --timestamp=none
to disable timestamps, even for a Developer ID identity.
.\"																				OPTIONS 
.Sh ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Cm --sign Ar identity-name
The name of the identity to use for signing the archive.
.It Cm --keychain Ar keychain-path
Specify a specific keychain to search for the signing identity.
.It Cm --timestamp
Include a trusted timestamp with the signature.
.It Cm --timestamp=none
Disable trusted timestamp, regardless of identity.
.It Ar input-file ...
The path to one or more files or directories to be archived.
.It Ar output-archive
The path to which the signed archive will be written.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBxmlcatalog\fR
is a command line application allowing users to monitor and manipulate
XML
and
SGML
catalogs\&. It is included in
\fBlibxml\fR(3)\&.
.PP
Its functions can be invoked from a single command from the command line, or it can perform multiple functions in interactive mode\&. It can operate on both
XML
and
SGML
files\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP

\fBxmlcatalog\fR
accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):
.PP
\fB\-\-add \fR\fB\fITYPE\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIORIG\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIREPLACE\fR\fR\fB \fR
.RS 4
Add an entry to
CATALOGFILE\&.
\fITYPE\fR
indicates the type of entry\&. Possible types are:
\fIpublic\fR, \fIsystem\fR, \fIuri\fR, \fIrewriteSystem\fR, \fIrewriteURI\fR, \fIdelegatePublic\fR, \fIdelegateSystem\fR, \fIdelegateURI\fR, \fInextCatalog\fR\&.
\fIORIG\fR
is the original reference to be replaced, and
\fIREPLACE\fR
is the
URI
of the replacement entity to be used\&. The
\fB\-\-add\fR
option will not overwrite
CATALOGFILE, outputting to
stdout, unless
\fB\-\-noout\fR
is used\&. The
\fB\-\-add\fR
will always take three parameters even if some of the
XML
catalog constructs will have only a single argument\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-add \fR\fB\fIFILENAME\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the
\fB\-\-add\fR
option is used following the
\fB\-\-sgml\fR
option, only a single argument, a
\fIFILENAME\fR, is used\&. This is used to add the name of a catalog file to an
SGML
supercatalog, a file that contains references to other included
SGML
catalog files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-create\fR
.RS 4
Create a new
XML
catalog\&. Outputs to
stdout, ignoring
\fIfilename\fR
unless
\fB\-\-noout\fR
is used, in which case it creates a new catalog file
\fIfilename\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-del \fR\fB\fIVALUE(S)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Remove entries from
\fICATALOGFILE\fR
matching
\fIVALUE(S)\fR\&. The
\fB\-\-del\fR
option will not overwrite
\fICATALOGFILE\fR, outputting to
stdout, unless
\fB\-\-noout\fR
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noout\fR
.RS 4
Save output to the named file rather than outputting to
stdout\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Do not update the
SGML
super catalog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-shell\fR
.RS 4
Run a shell allowing interactive queries on catalog file
\fICATALOGFILE\fR\&. For the set of available commands see
the section called \(lqSHELL COMMANDS\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sgml\fR
.RS 4
Uses
SGML
super catalogs for
\fB\-\-add\fR
and
\fB\-\-del\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Output debugging information\&.
.RE
.SH "SHELL COMMANDS"
.PP
Invoking
\fBxmlcatalog\fR
with the
\fB\-\-shell \fR\fB\fICATALOGFILE\fR\fR
option opens a command line shell allowing interactive access to the catalog file identified by
\fICATALOGFILE\fR\&. Invoking the shell provides a command line prompt after which the following commands (described in alphabetical order) can be entered\&.
.PP
\fBadd \fR\fB\fITYPE\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIORIG\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIREPLACE\fR\fR\fB \fR
.RS 4
Add an entry to the catalog file\&.
\fITYPE\fR
indicates the type of entry\&. Possible types are:
\fIpublic\fR, \fIsystem\fR, \fIuri\fR, \fIrewriteSystem\fR, \fIrewriteURI\fR, \fIdelegatePublic\fR, \fIdelegateSystem\fR, \fIdelegateURI\fR, \fInextCatalog\fR\&.
\fIORIG\fR
is the original reference to be replaced, and
\fIREPLACE\fR
is the
URI
of the replacement entity to be used\&. The
\fB\-\-add\fR
option will not overwrite
CATALOGFILE, outputting to
stdout, unless
\fB\-\-noout\fR
is used\&. The
\fB\-\-add\fR
will always take three parameters even if some of the
XML
catalog constructs will have only a single argument\&.
.RE
.PP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBxmllint\fR
program parses one or more
XML
files, specified on the command line as
\fIXML\-FILE\fR
(or the standard input if the filename provided is
\fB\-\fR
)\&. It prints various types of output, depending upon the options selected\&. It is useful for detecting errors both in

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBxsltproc\fR
is a command line tool for applying
XSLT
stylesheets to
XML
documents\. It is part of
\fBlibxslt\fR(3), the XSLT C library for GNOME\. While it was developed as part of the GNOME project, it can operate independently of the GNOME desktop\.
.PP

\fBxsltproc\fR
is invoked from the command line with the name of the stylesheet to be used followed by the name of the file or files to which the stylesheet is to be applied\. It will use the standard input if a filename provided is
\fB\-\fR
\.
.PP
If a stylesheet is included in an
XML
document with a Stylesheet Processing Instruction, no stylesheet need to be named at the command line\.
\fBxsltproc\fR
will automatically detect the included stylesheet and use it\.
.PP
By default, output is to
\fIstdout\fR\. You can specify a file for output using the
\fB\-o\fR
or
\fB\-\-output\fR
option\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP

\fBxsltproc\fR
accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):
.PP
\fB\-\-catalogs\fR
.RS 4
Use the
SGML
catalog specified in
\fBSGML_CATALOG_FILES\fR
to resolve the location of external entities\. By default,
\fBxsltproc\fR
looks for the catalog specified in
\fBXML_CATALOG_FILES\fR\. If that is not specified, it uses
\fI/etc/xml/catalog\fR\.
.RE

Pass a parameter of name
\fIPARAMNAME\fR
and value
\fIPARAMVALUE\fR
to the stylesheet\. You may pass multiple name/value pairs up to a maximum of 32\. If the value being passed is a string, you can use
\fB\-\-stringparam\fR
instead, to avoid additional quote characters that appear in string expressions\. Note: the XPath expression must be UTF\-8 encoded\.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker
or by Module::Build or other Perl module build tools.
.PP
\&\fIxsubpp\fR will compile \s-1XS\s0 code into C code by embedding the constructs
necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates the glue
necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses typemaps to
determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl values.
.PP
The compiler will search for typemap files called \fItypemap\fR.  It will use
the following search path to find default typemaps, with the rightmost
typemap taking precedence.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap

.PP
It will also use a default typemap installed as \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::typemap\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Note that the \f(CW\*(C`XSOPT\*(C'\fR MakeMaker option may be used to add these options to
any makefiles generated by MakeMaker.
.IP "\fB\-hiertype\fR" 5
.IX Item "-hiertype"
Retains '::' in type names so that \*(C+ hierarchical types can be mapped.
.IP "\fB\-except\fR" 5
.IX Item "-except"
Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.
.IP "\fB\-typemap typemap\fR" 5
.IX Item "-typemap typemap"
Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence over the
default typemaps.  This option may be used multiple times, with the last
typemap having the highest precedence.
.IP "\fB\-output filename\fR" 5
.IX Item "-output filename"
Specifies the name of the output file to generate.  If no file is
specified, output will be written to standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 5
.IX Item "-v"
Prints the \fIxsubpp\fR version number to standard output, then exits.
.IP "\fB\-prototypes\fR" 5
.IX Item "-prototypes"
By default \fIxsubpp\fR will not automatically generate prototype code for
all xsubs. This flag will enable prototypes.
.IP "\fB\-noversioncheck\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noversioncheck"
Disables the run time test that determines if the object file (derived
from the \f(CW\*(C`.xs\*(C'\fR file) and the \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR files have the same version
number.
.IP "\fB\-nolinenumbers\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nolinenumbers"
Prevents the inclusion of '#line' directives in the output.
.IP "\fB\-nooptimize\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nooptimize"
Disables certain optimizations.  The only optimization that is currently
affected is the use of \fItarget\fRs by the output C code (see perlguts).
This may significantly slow down the generated code, but this is the way
\&\fBxsubpp\fR of 5.005 and earlier operated.
.IP "\fB\-noinout\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noinout"
Disable recognition of \f(CW\*(C`IN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`OUT_LIST\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`INOUT_LIST\*(C'\fR declarations.
.IP "\fB\-noargtypes\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noargtypes"
Disable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function signature.
.IP "\fB\-\*(C+\fR" 5
.IX Item "-"
Currently doesn't do anything at all.  This flag has been a no-op for
many versions of perl, at least as far back as perl5.003_07.  It's
allowed here for backwards compatibility.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker
or by Module::Build or other Perl module build tools.
.PP
\&\fIxsubpp\fR will compile \s-1XS\s0 code into C code by embedding the constructs
necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates the glue
necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses typemaps to
determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl values.
.PP
The compiler will search for typemap files called \fItypemap\fR.  It will use
the following search path to find default typemaps, with the rightmost
typemap taking precedence.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap

.PP
It will also use a default typemap installed as \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::typemap\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Note that the \f(CW\*(C`XSOPT\*(C'\fR MakeMaker option may be used to add these options to
any makefiles generated by MakeMaker.
.IP "\fB\-hiertype\fR" 5
.IX Item "-hiertype"
Retains '::' in type names so that \*(C+ hierarchical types can be mapped.
.IP "\fB\-except\fR" 5
.IX Item "-except"
Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.
.IP "\fB\-typemap typemap\fR" 5
.IX Item "-typemap typemap"
Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence over the
default typemaps.  This option may be used multiple times, with the last
typemap having the highest precedence.
.IP "\fB\-output filename\fR" 5
.IX Item "-output filename"
Specifies the name of the output file to generate.  If no file is
specified, output will be written to standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 5
.IX Item "-v"
Prints the \fIxsubpp\fR version number to standard output, then exits.
.IP "\fB\-prototypes\fR" 5
.IX Item "-prototypes"
By default \fIxsubpp\fR will not automatically generate prototype code for
all xsubs. This flag will enable prototypes.
.IP "\fB\-noversioncheck\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noversioncheck"
Disables the run time test that determines if the object file (derived
from the \f(CW\*(C`.xs\*(C'\fR file) and the \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR files have the same version
number.
.IP "\fB\-nolinenumbers\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nolinenumbers"
Prevents the inclusion of '#line' directives in the output.
.IP "\fB\-nooptimize\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nooptimize"
Disables certain optimizations.  The only optimization that is currently
affected is the use of \fItarget\fRs by the output C code (see perlguts).
This may significantly slow down the generated code, but this is the way
\&\fBxsubpp\fR of 5.005 and earlier operated.
.IP "\fB\-noinout\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noinout"
Disable recognition of \f(CW\*(C`IN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`OUT_LIST\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`INOUT_LIST\*(C'\fR declarations.
.IP "\fB\-noargtypes\fR" 5
.IX Item "-noargtypes"
Disable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function signature.
.IP "\fB\-\*(C+\fR" 5
.IX Item "-"
Currently doesn't do anything at all.  This flag has been a no-op for
many versions of perl, at least as far back as perl5.003_07.  It's
allowed here for backwards compatibility.

.SH NAME
.I xxd
\- make a hexdump or do the reverse.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xxd
\-h[elp]
.br
.B xxd
[options] [infile [outfile]]
.br
.B xxd
\-r[evert] [options] [infile [outfile]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xxd
creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.
It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.
Like
.BR uuencode (1)
and
.BR uudecode (1)
it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-safe' ASCII representation,
but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.
Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.
.SH OPTIONS
If no
.I infile
is given, standard input is read.
If
.I infile
is specified as a
.RB \` \- '
character, then input is taken from standard input.
If no
.I outfile
is given (or a
.RB \` \- '
character is in its place), results are sent to standard output.
.PP
Note that a "lazy" parser is used which does not check for more than the first
option letter, unless the option is followed by a parameter.
Spaces between a single option letter and its parameter are optional.
Parameters to options can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal or octal
notation.
Thus
.BR \-c8 ,
.BR "\-c 8" ,
.B \-c 010
and
.B \-cols 8
are all equivalent.
.PP
.TP
.IR \-a " | " \-autoskip
toggle autoskip: A single '*' replaces nul-lines.  Default off.
.TP
.IR \-b " | " \-bits
Switch to bits (binary digits) dump, rather than hexdump.
This option writes octets as eight digits "1"s and "0"s instead of a normal
hexadecimal dump. Each line is preceded by a line number in hexadecimal and
followed by an ascii (or ebcdic) representation. The command line switches
\-r, \-p, \-i do not work with this mode.
.TP
.IR "\-c cols " | " \-cols cols"
format
.RI < cols >
octets per line. Default 16 (\-i: 12, \-ps: 30, \-b: 6). Max 256.
.TP
.IR \-E " | " \-EBCDIC
Change the character encoding in the righthand column from ASCII to EBCDIC.
This does not change the hexadecimal representation. The option is
meaningless in combinations with \-r, \-p or \-i.
.TP
.IR "\-g bytes " | " \-groupsize bytes"
separate the output of every
.RI < bytes >
bytes (two hex characters or eight bit-digits each) by a whitespace.
Specify
.I \-g 0
to suppress grouping.
.RI < Bytes "> defaults to " 2
in normal mode and \fI1\fP in bits mode.
Grouping does not apply to postscript or include style.
.TP
.IR \-h " | " \-help
print a summary of available commands and exit.  No hex dumping is performed.
.TP
.IR \-i " | " \-include
output in C include file style. A complete static array definition is written
(named after the input file), unless xxd reads from stdin.
.TP
.IR "\-l len " | " \-len len"
stop after writing
.RI  < len >
octets.
.TP
.IR \-p " | " \-ps " | " \-postscript " | " \-plain
output in postscript continuous hexdump style. Also known as plain hexdump
style.
.TP
.IR \-r " | " \-revert
reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into binary.
If not writing to stdout, xxd writes into its output file without truncating
it. Use the combination
.I \-r \-p
to read plain hexadecimal dumps without line number information and without a
particular column layout. Additional Whitespace and line-breaks are allowed
anywhere.
.TP
.I \-seek offset
When used after
.IR \-r :
revert with
.RI < offset >
added to file positions found in hexdump.
.TP
.I \-s [+][\-]seek
start at
.RI < seek >
bytes abs. (or rel.) infile offset.
\fI+ \fRindicates that the seek is relative to the current stdin file position
(meaningless when not reading from stdin).  \fI\- \fRindicates that the seek
should be that many characters from the end of the input (or if combined with
\fI+\fR: before the current stdin file position).
Without \-s option, xxd starts at the current file position.
.TP
.I \-u
use upper case hex letters. Default is lower case.
.TP
.IR \-v " | " \-version
show version string.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.I xxd \-r
has some builtin magic while evaluating line number information.
If the output file is seekable, then the linenumbers at the start of each
hexdump line may be out of order, lines may be missing, or overlapping. In
these cases xxd will lseek(2) to the next position. If the output file is not
seekable, only gaps are allowed, which will be filled by null-bytes.
.PP
.I xxd \-r
never generates parse errors. Garbage is silently skipped.
.PP
When editing hexdumps, please note that
.I xxd \-r
skips everything on the input line after reading enough columns of hexadecimal
data (see option \-c). This also means, that changes to the printable ascii (or
ebcdic) columns are always ignored. Reverting a plain (or postscript) style
hexdump with xxd \-r \-p does not depend on the correct number of columns. Here anything that looks like a pair of hex-digits is interpreted.
.PP
Note the difference between
.br
\fI% xxd \-i file\fR
.br
and
.br
\fI% xxd \-i < file\fR
.PP
.I xxd \-s +seek
may be different from
.IR "xxd \-s seek" ,
as lseek(2) is used to "rewind" input.  A '+'
makes a difference if the input source is stdin, and if stdin's file position
is not at the start of the file by the time xxd is started and given its input.
The following examples may help to clarify (or further confuse!)...
.PP
Rewind stdin before reading; needed because the `cat' has already read to the
end of stdin.
.br
\fI% sh \-c "cat > plain_copy; xxd \-s 0 > hex_copy" < file\fR
.PP
Hexdump from file position 0x480 (=1024+128) onwards.
The `+' sign means "relative to the current position", thus the `128' adds to
the 1k where dd left off.
.br
\fI% sh \-c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd \-s +128 > hex_snippet" < file\fR
.PP
Hexdump from file position 0x100 ( = 1024\-768) on.
.br
\fI% sh \-c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd \-s +\-768 > hex_snippet" < file\fR
.PP
However, this is a rare situation and the use of `+' is rarely needed.
The author prefers to monitor the effect of xxd with strace(1) or truss(1), whenever \-s is used.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program compresses and decompresses files using Lempel-Ziv coding
(LZ77).
If no
.Ar files
are specified,
.Nm
will compress from standard input, or decompress to standard output.
When in compression mode, each
.Ar file
will be replaced with another file with the suffix, set by the
.Fl S Ar suffix
option, added, if possible.
.Pp
In decompression mode, each
.Ar file
will be checked for existence, as will the file with the suffix
added.
Each
.Ar file
argument must contain a separate complete archive;
when multiple
.Ar files
are indicated, each is decompressed in turn.
.Pp
In the case of
.Nm gzcat
the resulting data is then concatenated in the manner of
.Xr cat 1 .
.Pp
If invoked as
.Nm gunzip
then the
.Fl d
option is enabled.
If invoked as
.Nm zcat
or
.Nm gzcat
then both the
.Fl c
and
.Fl d
options are enabled.
When invoked as
.Nm zcat ,
.Dq .Z
will be appended to all filenames that do not have that suffix.
.Pp
This version of
.Nm
is also capable of decompressing files compressed using
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr bzip2 1 .
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XXrXXXrecursiveX
.It Fl 1 , -fast
.It Fl 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8
.It Fl 9 , -best
These options change the compression level used, with the
.Fl 1
option being the fastest, with less compression, and the
.Fl 9
option being the slowest, with optimal compression.
The default compression level is 6.
.It Fl c , -stdout , -to-stdout
This option specifies that output will go to the standard output
stream, leaving files intact.
.It Fl d , -decompress , -uncompress
This option selects decompression rather than compression.
.It Fl f , -force
This option turns on force mode.
This allows files with multiple links, symbolic links to regular files,
overwriting of pre-existing files, reading from or writing to a terminal,
and when combined with the
.Fl c
option, allowing non-compressed data to pass through unchanged.
.It Fl h , -help
This option prints a usage summary and exits.
.It Fl k , -keep
Keep (don't delete) input files during compression
or decompression.
.It Fl L , -license
This option prints
.Nm
license.
.It Fl l , -list
This option displays information about the file's compressed and
uncompressed size, ratio, uncompressed name.
With the
.Fl v
option, it also displays the compression method, CRC, date and time
embedded in the file.
.It Fl N , -name
This option causes the stored filename in the input file to be used
as the output file.
.It Fl n , -no-name
This option stops the filename and timestamp from being stored in
the output file.
.It Fl q , -quiet
With this option, no warnings or errors are printed.
.It Fl r , -recursive
This option is used to
.Nm
the files in a directory tree individually, using the
.Xr fts 3
library.
.It Fl S Ar suffix , Fl -suffix Ar suffix
This option changes the default suffix from .gz to
.Ar suffix .
.It Fl t , -test
This option will test compressed files for integrity.
.It Fl V , -version
This option prints the version of the
.Nm
program.
.It Fl v , -verbose
This option turns on verbose mode, which prints the compression
ratio for each file compressed.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the environment variable
.Ev GZIP
is set, it is parsed as a white-space separated list of options
handled before any options on the command line.
Options on the command line will override anything in
.Ev GZIP .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was originally written by Jean-loup Gailly, licensed under
the GNU Public Licence.
Matthew R. Green wrote a simple front end for
.Nx 1.3
distribution media, based on the freely re-distributable zlib library.
It was enhanced to be mostly feature-compatible with the original
GNU
.Nm
program for
.Nx 2.0 .
.Pp
This implementation of
.Nm
was ported based on the
.Nx
.Nm ,
and first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
This implementation of
.Nm
was written by
.An Matthew R. Green Aq mrg@eterna.com.au
with unpack support written by
.An Xin LI Aq delphij@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
According to RFC 1952, the recorded file size is stored in a 32-bit
integer, therefore, it can not represent files larger than 4GB.
This limitation also applies to
.Fl l
option of
.Nm
utility.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm grep
utility searches any given input files,
selecting lines that match one or more patterns.
By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression
(RE) in the pattern matches the input line
without its trailing newline.
An empty expression matches every line.
Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
to the standard output.
.Pp
.Nm grep
is used for simple patterns and
basic regular expressions
.Pq BREs ;
.Nm egrep
can handle extended regular expressions
.Pq EREs .
See
.Xr re_format 7
for more information on regular expressions.
.Nm fgrep
is quicker than both
.Nm grep
and
.Nm egrep ,
but can only handle fixed patterns
(i.e. it does not interpret regular expressions).
Patterns may consist of one or more lines,
allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.
.Pp
.Nm zgrep ,
.Nm zegrep ,
and
.Nm zfgrep
act like
.Nm grep ,
.Nm egrep ,
and
.Nm fgrep ,
respectively, but accept input files compressed with the
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr gzip 1
compression utilities.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar num , Fl Fl after-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of trailing context after each match.
See also the
.Fl B
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl a , Fl Fl text
Treat all files as ASCII text.
Normally
.Nm
will simply print
.Dq Binary file ... matches
if files contain binary characters.
Use of this option forces
.Nm
to output lines matching the specified pattern.
.It Fl B Ar num , Fl Fl before-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading context before each match.
See also the
.Fl A
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl b , Fl Fl byte-offset
The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is
displayed in front of the respective matched line.
.It Fl C Ns Op Ar num , Fl Fl context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match.
The default is 2 and is equivalent to
.Fl A
.Ar 2
.Fl B
.Ar 2 .
Note:
no whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.
.It Fl c , Fl Fl count
Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.
.It Fl Fl colour Ns = Ns Op Ar when , Fl Fl color Ns = Ns Op Ar when
Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in
.Ev GREP_COLOR
environment variable.
The possible values of when can be `never', `always' or `auto'.
.It Fl D Ar action , Fl Fl devices Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.
The default action is `read', which means, that they are read
as if they were normal files.
If the action is set to `skip', devices will be silently skipped.
.It Fl d Ar action , Fl Fl directories Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for directories.
It is `read' by default, which means that the directories
are read in the same manner as normal files.
Other possible values are `skip' to silently ignore the
directories, and `recurse' to read them recursively, which
has the same effect as the
.Fl R
and
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl E , Fl Fl extended-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as an extended regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm egrep ) .
.It Fl e Ar pattern , Fl Fl regexp Ns = Ns Ar pattern
Specify a pattern used during the search of the input:
an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
This option is most useful when multiple
.Fl e
options are used to specify multiple patterns,
or when a pattern begins with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
.It Fl Fl exclude
If specified, it excludes files matching the given
filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include
pattern is specified, all files are searched that are
not excluded.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl exclude-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, it excludes directories matching the
given filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include-dir
pattern is specified, all directories are searched that are
not excluded.
.It Fl F , Fl Fl fixed-strings
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a set of fixed strings
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm fgrep ) .
.It Fl f Ar file , Fl Fl file Ns = Ns Ar file
Read one or more newline separated patterns from
.Ar file .
Empty pattern lines match every input line.
Newlines are not considered part of a pattern.
If
.Ar file
is empty, nothing is matched.
.It Fl G , Fl Fl basic-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a basic regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as traditional
.Nm grep ) .
.It Fl H
Always print filename headers with output lines.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl no-filename
Never print filename headers
.Pq i.e. filenames
with output lines.
.It Fl Fl help
Print a brief help message.
.It Fl I
Ignore binary files.
This option is equivalent to
.Fl Fl binary-file Ns = Ns Ar without-match
option.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl ignore-case
Perform case insensitive matching.
By default,
.Nm grep
is case sensitive.
.It Fl Fl include
If specified, only files matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl include-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, only directories matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns.
.It Fl J, Fl Fl bz2decompress
Decompress the
.Xr bzip2 1
compressed file before looking for the text.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl files-without-match
Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl l , Fl Fl files-with-matches
Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl Fl mmap
Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of
.Xr read 2
to read input, which can result in better performance under some
circumstances but can cause undefined behaviour.
.It Fl m Ar num, Fl Fl max-count Ns = Ns Ar num
Stop reading the file after
.Ar num
matches.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl line-number
Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file,
starting at line 1.
The line number counter is reset for each file processed.
This option is ignored if
.Fl c ,
.Fl L ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl q
is
specified.
.It Fl Fl null
Prints a zero-byte after the file name.
.It Fl O
If
.Fl R
is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explicitly listed
on the command line.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl o, Fl Fl only-matching
Prints only the matching part of the lines.
.It Fl p
If
.Fl R
is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl q , Fl Fl quiet , Fl Fl silent
Quiet mode:
suppress normal output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
.It Fl R , Fl r , Fl Fl recursive
Recursively search subdirectories listed.
.It Fl S
If
.Fl R
is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl no-messages
Silent mode.
Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored
(i.e. their error messages are suppressed).
.It Fl U , Fl Fl binary
Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl invert-match
Selected lines are those
.Em not
matching any of the specified patterns.
.It Fl w , Fl Fl word-regexp
The expression is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by
.Sq [[:<:]]
and
.Sq [[:>:]] ;
see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.It Fl x , Fl Fl line-regexp
Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular
expression are considered to be matching lines.
.It Fl y
Equivalent to
.Fl i .
Obsoleted.
.It Fl Z , Fl z , Fl Fl decompress
Force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm zgrep .
.It Fl Fl binary-files Ns = Ns Ar value
Controls searching and printing of binary files.
Options are
.Ar binary ,
the default: search binary files but do not print them;
.Ar without-match :
do not search binary files;
and
.Ar text :
treat all files as text.
.Sm off
.It Fl Fl context Op = Ar num
.Sm on
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context.
The default is 2.
.It Fl Fl line-buffered
Force output to be line buffered.
By default, output is line buffered when standard output is a terminal
and block buffered otherwise.
.Pp
.El
If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "GREP_OPTIONS"
.It Ev GREP_OPTIONS
May be used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning
of the argument list.
Backslash-escaping is not supported, unlike the behavior in GNU grep.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm grep
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li 0
One or more lines were selected.
.It Li 1
No lines were selected.
.It Li \*(Gt1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To find all occurrences of the word
.Sq patricia
in a file:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep 'patricia' myfile
.Pp
To find all occurrences of the pattern
.Ql .Pp
at the beginning of a line:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep '^\e.Pp' myfile
.Pp
The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by
.Nm grep
instead of by the user's shell.
The caret
.Ql ^
matches the null string at the beginning of a line,
and the
.Ql \e
escapes the
.Ql \&. ,
which would otherwise match any character.
.Pp
To find all lines in a file which do not contain the words
.Sq foo
or
.Sq bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile
.Pp
A simple example of an extended regular expression:
.Pp
.Dl $ egrep '19|20|25' calendar
.Pp
Peruses the file
.Sq calendar
looking for either 19, 20, or 25.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl AaBbCDdGHhIJLmoPRSUVwZ
are extensions to that specification, and the behaviour of the
.Fl f
flag when used with an empty pattern file is left undefined.
.Pp
All long options are provided for compatibility with
GNU versions of this utility.
.Pp
Historic versions of the
.Nm grep
utility also supported the flags
.Op Fl ruy .
This implementation supports those options;
however, their use is strongly discouraged.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm grep
command first appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not normalize Unicode input, so a pattern containing composed
characters will not match decomposed input, and vice versa.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm grep
utility searches any given input files,
selecting lines that match one or more patterns.
By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression
(RE) in the pattern matches the input line
without its trailing newline.
An empty expression matches every line.
Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
to the standard output.
.Pp
.Nm grep
is used for simple patterns and
basic regular expressions
.Pq BREs ;
.Nm egrep
can handle extended regular expressions
.Pq EREs .
See
.Xr re_format 7
for more information on regular expressions.
.Nm fgrep
is quicker than both
.Nm grep
and
.Nm egrep ,
but can only handle fixed patterns
(i.e. it does not interpret regular expressions).
Patterns may consist of one or more lines,
allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.
.Pp
.Nm zgrep ,
.Nm zegrep ,
and
.Nm zfgrep
act like
.Nm grep ,
.Nm egrep ,
and
.Nm fgrep ,
respectively, but accept input files compressed with the
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr gzip 1
compression utilities.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar num , Fl Fl after-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of trailing context after each match.
See also the
.Fl B
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl a , Fl Fl text
Treat all files as ASCII text.
Normally
.Nm
will simply print
.Dq Binary file ... matches
if files contain binary characters.
Use of this option forces
.Nm
to output lines matching the specified pattern.
.It Fl B Ar num , Fl Fl before-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading context before each match.
See also the
.Fl A
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl b , Fl Fl byte-offset
The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is
displayed in front of the respective matched line.
.It Fl C Ns Op Ar num , Fl Fl context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match.
The default is 2 and is equivalent to
.Fl A
.Ar 2
.Fl B
.Ar 2 .
Note:
no whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.
.It Fl c , Fl Fl count
Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.
.It Fl Fl colour Ns = Ns Op Ar when , Fl Fl color Ns = Ns Op Ar when
Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in
.Ev GREP_COLOR
environment variable.
The possible values of when can be `never', `always' or `auto'.
.It Fl D Ar action , Fl Fl devices Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.
The default action is `read', which means, that they are read
as if they were normal files.
If the action is set to `skip', devices will be silently skipped.
.It Fl d Ar action , Fl Fl directories Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for directories.
It is `read' by default, which means that the directories
are read in the same manner as normal files.
Other possible values are `skip' to silently ignore the
directories, and `recurse' to read them recursively, which
has the same effect as the
.Fl R
and
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl E , Fl Fl extended-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as an extended regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm egrep ) .
.It Fl e Ar pattern , Fl Fl regexp Ns = Ns Ar pattern
Specify a pattern used during the search of the input:
an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
This option is most useful when multiple
.Fl e
options are used to specify multiple patterns,
or when a pattern begins with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
.It Fl Fl exclude
If specified, it excludes files matching the given
filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include
pattern is specified, all files are searched that are
not excluded.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl exclude-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, it excludes directories matching the
given filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include-dir
pattern is specified, all directories are searched that are
not excluded.
.It Fl F , Fl Fl fixed-strings
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a set of fixed strings
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm fgrep ) .
.It Fl f Ar file , Fl Fl file Ns = Ns Ar file
Read one or more newline separated patterns from
.Ar file .
Empty pattern lines match every input line.
Newlines are not considered part of a pattern.
If
.Ar file
is empty, nothing is matched.
.It Fl G , Fl Fl basic-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a basic regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as traditional
.Nm grep ) .
.It Fl H
Always print filename headers with output lines.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl no-filename
Never print filename headers
.Pq i.e. filenames
with output lines.
.It Fl Fl help
Print a brief help message.
.It Fl I
Ignore binary files.
This option is equivalent to
.Fl Fl binary-file Ns = Ns Ar without-match
option.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl ignore-case
Perform case insensitive matching.
By default,
.Nm grep
is case sensitive.
.It Fl Fl include
If specified, only files matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl include-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, only directories matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns.
.It Fl J, Fl Fl bz2decompress
Decompress the
.Xr bzip2 1
compressed file before looking for the text.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl files-without-match
Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl l , Fl Fl files-with-matches
Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl Fl mmap
Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of
.Xr read 2
to read input, which can result in better performance under some
circumstances but can cause undefined behaviour.
.It Fl m Ar num, Fl Fl max-count Ns = Ns Ar num
Stop reading the file after
.Ar num
matches.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl line-number
Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file,
starting at line 1.
The line number counter is reset for each file processed.
This option is ignored if
.Fl c ,
.Fl L ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl q
is
specified.
.It Fl Fl null
Prints a zero-byte after the file name.
.It Fl O
If
.Fl R
is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explicitly listed
on the command line.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl o, Fl Fl only-matching
Prints only the matching part of the lines.
.It Fl p
If
.Fl R
is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl q , Fl Fl quiet , Fl Fl silent
Quiet mode:
suppress normal output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
.It Fl R , Fl r , Fl Fl recursive
Recursively search subdirectories listed.
.It Fl S
If
.Fl R
is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl no-messages
Silent mode.
Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored
(i.e. their error messages are suppressed).
.It Fl U , Fl Fl binary
Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl invert-match
Selected lines are those
.Em not
matching any of the specified patterns.
.It Fl w , Fl Fl word-regexp
The expression is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by
.Sq [[:<:]]
and
.Sq [[:>:]] ;
see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.It Fl x , Fl Fl line-regexp
Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular
expression are considered to be matching lines.
.It Fl y
Equivalent to
.Fl i .
Obsoleted.
.It Fl Z , Fl z , Fl Fl decompress
Force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm zgrep .
.It Fl Fl binary-files Ns = Ns Ar value
Controls searching and printing of binary files.
Options are
.Ar binary ,
the default: search binary files but do not print them;
.Ar without-match :
do not search binary files;
and
.Ar text :
treat all files as text.
.Sm off
.It Fl Fl context Op = Ar num
.Sm on
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context.
The default is 2.
.It Fl Fl line-buffered
Force output to be line buffered.
By default, output is line buffered when standard output is a terminal
and block buffered otherwise.
.Pp
.El
If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "GREP_OPTIONS"
.It Ev GREP_OPTIONS
May be used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning
of the argument list.
Backslash-escaping is not supported, unlike the behavior in GNU grep.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm grep
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li 0
One or more lines were selected.
.It Li 1
No lines were selected.
.It Li \*(Gt1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To find all occurrences of the word
.Sq patricia
in a file:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep 'patricia' myfile
.Pp
To find all occurrences of the pattern
.Ql .Pp
at the beginning of a line:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep '^\e.Pp' myfile
.Pp
The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by
.Nm grep
instead of by the user's shell.
The caret
.Ql ^
matches the null string at the beginning of a line,
and the
.Ql \e
escapes the
.Ql \&. ,
which would otherwise match any character.
.Pp
To find all lines in a file which do not contain the words
.Sq foo
or
.Sq bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile
.Pp
A simple example of an extended regular expression:
.Pp
.Dl $ egrep '19|20|25' calendar
.Pp
Peruses the file
.Sq calendar
looking for either 19, 20, or 25.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ed 1 ,
.Xr ex 1 ,
.Xr gzip 1 ,
.Xr sed 1 ,
.Xr re_format 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl AaBbCDdGHhIJLmoPRSUVwZ
are extensions to that specification, and the behaviour of the
.Fl f
flag when used with an empty pattern file is left undefined.
.Pp
All long options are provided for compatibility with
GNU versions of this utility.
.Pp
Historic versions of the
.Nm grep
utility also supported the flags
.Op Fl ruy .
This implementation supports those options;
however, their use is strongly discouraged.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm grep
command first appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not normalize Unicode input, so a pattern containing composed
characters will not match decomposed input, and vice versa.

.It Fl E , Fl Fl extended-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as an extended regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm egrep ) .
.It Fl e Ar pattern , Fl Fl regexp Ns = Ns Ar pattern
Specify a pattern used during the search of the input:
an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
This option is most useful when multiple
.Fl e
options are used to specify multiple patterns,
or when a pattern begins with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
.It Fl Fl exclude
If specified, it excludes files matching the given
filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include
pattern is specified, all files are searched that are
not excluded.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl exclude-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, it excludes directories matching the
given filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include-dir
pattern is specified, all directories are searched that are
not excluded.
.It Fl F , Fl Fl fixed-strings
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a set of fixed strings
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm fgrep ) .
.It Fl f Ar file , Fl Fl file Ns = Ns Ar file
Read one or more newline separated patterns from
.Ar file .
Empty pattern lines match every input line.
Newlines are not considered part of a pattern.
If
.Ar file
is empty, nothing is matched.
.It Fl G , Fl Fl basic-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a basic regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as traditional
.Nm grep ) .
.It Fl H
Always print filename headers with output lines.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl no-filename
Never print filename headers
.Pq i.e. filenames
with output lines.
.It Fl Fl help
Print a brief help message.
.It Fl I
Ignore binary files.
This option is equivalent to
.Fl Fl binary-file Ns = Ns Ar without-match
option.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl ignore-case
Perform case insensitive matching.
By default,
.Nm grep
is case sensitive.
.It Fl Fl include
If specified, only files matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl include-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, only directories matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns.
.It Fl J, Fl Fl bz2decompress
Decompress the
.Xr bzip2 1
compressed file before looking for the text.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl files-without-match
Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl l , Fl Fl files-with-matches
Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl Fl mmap
Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of
.Xr read 2
to read input, which can result in better performance under some
circumstances but can cause undefined behaviour.
.It Fl m Ar num, Fl Fl max-count Ns = Ns Ar num
Stop reading the file after
.Ar num
matches.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl line-number
Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file,
starting at line 1.
The line number counter is reset for each file processed.
This option is ignored if
.Fl c ,
.Fl L ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl q
is
specified.
.It Fl Fl null
Prints a zero-byte after the file name.
.It Fl O
If
.Fl R
is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explicitly listed
on the command line.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl o, Fl Fl only-matching
Prints only the matching part of the lines.
.It Fl p
If
.Fl R
is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl q , Fl Fl quiet , Fl Fl silent
Quiet mode:
suppress normal output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
.It Fl R , Fl r , Fl Fl recursive
Recursively search subdirectories listed.
.It Fl S
If
.Fl R
is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl no-messages
Silent mode.
Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored
(i.e. their error messages are suppressed).
.It Fl U , Fl Fl binary
Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl invert-match
Selected lines are those
.Em not
matching any of the specified patterns.
.It Fl w , Fl Fl word-regexp
The expression is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by
.Sq [[:<:]]
and
.Sq [[:>:]] ;
see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.It Fl x , Fl Fl line-regexp
Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular
expression are considered to be matching lines.
.It Fl y
Equivalent to
.Fl i .
Obsoleted.
.It Fl Z , Fl z , Fl Fl decompress
Force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm zgrep .
.It Fl Fl binary-files Ns = Ns Ar value
Controls searching and printing of binary files.
Options are
.Ar binary ,
the default: search binary files but do not print them;
.Ar without-match :
do not search binary files;
and
.Ar text :
treat all files as text.
.Sm off
.It Fl Fl context Op = Ar num
.Sm on
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context.
The default is 2.
.It Fl Fl line-buffered
Force output to be line buffered.
By default, output is line buffered when standard output is a terminal
and block buffered otherwise.
.Pp
.El
If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "GREP_OPTIONS"
.It Ev GREP_OPTIONS
May be used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning
of the argument list.
Backslash-escaping is not supported, unlike the behavior in GNU grep.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm grep
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li 0
One or more lines were selected.
.It Li 1
No lines were selected.
.It Li \*(Gt1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To find all occurrences of the word
.Sq patricia
in a file:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep 'patricia' myfile
.Pp
To find all occurrences of the pattern
.Ql .Pp
at the beginning of a line:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep '^\e.Pp' myfile
.Pp
The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by
.Nm grep
instead of by the user's shell.
The caret
.Ql ^
matches the null string at the beginning of a line,
and the
.Ql \e
escapes the
.Ql \&. ,
which would otherwise match any character.
.Pp
To find all lines in a file which do not contain the words
.Sq foo
or
.Sq bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile
.Pp
A simple example of an extended regular expression:
.Pp
.Dl $ egrep '19|20|25' calendar
.Pp
Peruses the file
.Sq calendar
looking for either 19, 20, or 25.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl AaBbCDdGHhIJLmoPRSUVwZ
are extensions to that specification, and the behaviour of the
.Fl f
flag when used with an empty pattern file is left undefined.
.Pp
All long options are provided for compatibility with
GNU versions of this utility.
.Pp
Historic versions of the
.Nm grep
utility also supported the flags
.Op Fl ruy .
This implementation supports those options;
however, their use is strongly discouraged.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm grep
command first appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not normalize Unicode input, so a pattern containing composed
characters will not match decomposed input, and vice versa.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zip
is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn
RISC OS.  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands
.IR tar (1)
and
.IR compress (1)
and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
.LP
A companion program
.RI ( unzip (1L))
unpacks
.I zip
archives.
The
.I zip
and
.IR unzip (1L)
programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting
most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6),
and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
\fIzip\fP (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives,
but recent changes in the zip file standard may facilitate
better compatibility).
.I zip
version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and also supports
the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow archives
as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in
some cases).  \fIzip\fP also now supports \fBbzip2\fP compression
if the \fBbzip2\fP library is included when \fIzip\fP is compiled.
Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by
PKZIP 2.04 or
\fIzip\ 3.0\fP. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
\fIunzip\ 5.0p1\fP (or later versions) to extract them.
.PP
See the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section at the bottom of this page
for examples of some typical uses of \fIzip\fP.
.PP
\fBLarge\ Archives\ and\ Zip64.\fP
.I zip
automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when files larger than 4 GB are
added to an archive, an archive containing Zip64 entries is updated
(if the resulting archive still needs Zip64),
the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the
number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.
Zip64 is also used for archives streamed from standard input as the size
of such archives are not known in advance, but the option \fB\-fz\-\fP can
be used to force \fIzip\fP to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long
as Zip64 extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5
compatible unzip, such as \fIunzip\ 6.0\fP or later, to extract files
using the Zip64 extensions.
.PP
In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard encryption,
or split archives created with the pause option may not be compatible with
PKZIP as data descriptors are used
and PKZIP at the time of this writing does not support data descriptors
(but recent changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some
support for the data descriptor format \fIzip\fP uses).

.PP
\fBMac OS X.\fP  Though previous Mac versions had their own \fIzip\fP port,
\fIzip\fP supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features
apply.  References to "MacOS" below generally refer to MacOS versions older
than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X port, such
as resource forks, is expected in the next \fIzip\fP release.

.PP
For a brief help on \fIzip\fP and \fIunzip\fP,
run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.

.SH "USE"
.PP
The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;
for archiving files;
and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.
.LP
The
.I zip
program puts one or more compressed files into a single
.I zip
archive,
along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity).
An entire directory structure can be packed into a
.I zip
archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.
.I zip
has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without
compression.  (If \fBbzip2\fP support is added, \fIzip\fP can also
compress using \fBbzip2\fP compression, but such entries require a
reasonably modern unzip to decompress.  When \fBbzip2\fP compression
is selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.)
.I zip
automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store or, if
\fBbzip2\fP is selected, \fBbzip2\fP or store) for each file to be
compressed.
.LP
\fBCommand\ format.\fP  The basic command format is
.IP
\fBzip\fR options archive inpath inpath ...
.LP
where \fBarchive\fR is a new or existing \fIzip\fR archive
and \fBinpath\fR is a directory or file path optionally including wildcards.
When given the name of an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will replace identically named entries in the
.I zip
archive (matching the relative names as stored in
the archive) or add entries for new names.
For example,
if
.I foo.zip
exists and contains
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file2 ,
and the directory
.I foo
contains the files
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
then:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo.zip foo\fP
.LP
or more concisely
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
will replace
.I foo/file1
in
.I foo.zip
and add
.I foo/file3
to
.IR foo.zip .
After this,
.I foo.zip
contains
.IR foo/file1 ,
.IR foo/file2 ,
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
with
.I foo/file2
unchanged from before.
.LP
So if before the zip command is executed \fIfoo.zip\fP has:
.IP
\fC foo/file1 foo/file2
.LP
and directory foo has:
.IP
\fC file1 file3\fP
.LP
then \fIfoo.zip\fP will have:
.IP
\fC foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3\fP
.LP
where \fIfoo/file1\fP is replaced and
\fIfoo/file3\fP is new.
.LP
\fB\-@\ file\ lists.\fP  If a file list is specified as
\fB\-@\fP
[Not on MacOS],
.I zip
takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from
the command line.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip -@ foo\fP
.LP
will store the files listed one per line on stdin in \fIfoo.zip\fP.
.LP
Under Unix,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the
\fIfind\fP\ (1)
command.
For example,
to archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:
.IP
\fCfind . -name "*.[ch]" -print | zip source -@\fP
.LP
(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).
.LP
\fBStreaming\ input\ and\ output.\fP
.I zip
will also accept a single dash ("-") as the zip file name, in which case it
will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped
to another program. For example:
.IP
\fCzip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.
.LP
.I zip
also accepts a single dash ("-") as the name of a file to be compressed, in
which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip backup -\fP
.LP
would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better compression than
the previous example using the -r option because
.I zip
can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored
using the command
.IP
\fCunzip -p backup | tar xf -\fP
.LP
When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
.I zip
acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
For example,
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
.I zip
archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program
.I funzip
which is provided in the
.I unzip
package, or by
.I gunzip
which is provided in the
.I gzip
package (but some
.I gunzip
may not support this if
.I zip
used the Zip64 extensions). For example:
.IP
\fPdd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -\fC
.LP
The stream can also be saved to a file and
.I unzip
used.
.LP
If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and
\fIzip\fR is used as a filter, \fIzip\fR creates a Zip64 archive
that requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip to read it.  This is
to avoid amgibuities in the zip file structure as defined in the current
zip standard (PKWARE AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to
be made before data is written for the entry, but for a stream the size
of the data is not known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller
than 4 GB, the option \fB\-fz\-\fP can be used to prevent use of Zip64,
but \fIzip\fP will exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact needed.
\fIzip\ 3\fR and \fIunzip\ 6\fR and later can read archives with Zip64
entries.  Also, \fIzip\fP removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed
when archive entries are copied (see the \fB\-U\fP (\fB\-\-copy\fP)
option).
.LP
When directing the output to another file, note that all options should be
before the redirection including \fB-x\fP.  For example:
.IP
\fPzip archive "*.h" "*.c" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h > tofile\fC
.LP
\fBZip\ files.\fP  When changing an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will write a temporary file with the new contents,
and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version
has been completed without error.
.LP
If the name of the
.I zip
archive does not contain an extension, the extension
\fB.zip\fP
is added. If the name already contains an extension other than
\fB.zip\fP,
the existing extension is kept unchanged.  However, split archives
(archives split over multiple files) require the \fB.zip\fP extension
on the last split.
.PP
\fBScanning\ and\ reading\ files.\fP
When \fIzip\fP starts, it scans for files to process (if needed).  If
this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds, \fIzip\fP will display
a "Scanning files" message and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds
or every so many entries processed, whichever takes longer.  If there is more
than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that finding each file is taking
time and could mean a slow network connection for example.
(Actually the initial file scan is
a two-step process where the directory scan is followed by a sort and these
two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If updating an existing
archive, a space also appears between the existing file scan and the new
file scan.)  The scanning files dots are not controlled by the \fB\-ds\fP
dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the \fB\-q\fP quiet option.  The
\fB\-sf\fP show files option can be used to scan for files and get the list of
files scanned without actually processing them.
.LP
If \fIzip\fR is not able to read a file, it
issues a warning but
continues.  See the \fB\-MM\fP option below for more on how \fIzip\fP handles
patterns that are not matched and files that are not readable.
If some files were skipped, a
warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how many files
were read and how many skipped.
.PP
\fBCommand\ modes.\fP  \fIzip\fP now supports two distinct types of command
modes, \fBexternal\fP and \fBinternal\fP.  The \fBexternal\fP modes
(add, update, and freshen) read files from the file system (as well as from an
existing archive) while the \fBinternal\fP modes (delete and copy) operate
exclusively on entries in an existing archive.
.LP
.TP
.BI add\ \ \ \ \ \ 
Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does not exist
create it.  This is the default mode.
.TP
.BI update\ \fP(\fB\-u\fP)
Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files.  If
the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.
.TP
.BI freshen\ \fP(\fB\-f\fP)
Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file system.
Does not add new files to the archive.
.TP
.BI delete\ \fP(\fB\-d\fP)
Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.
.TP
.BI copy\ \fP(\fB\-U\fP)
Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive.
This new mode is similar to \fBupdate\fP but command line patterns
select entries in the existing archive rather than files from
the file system and it uses the \fB\-\-out\fP option to write the
resulting archive to a new file rather than update the existing
archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.
.LP
The new File Sync option (\fB\-FS\fP) is also considered a new mode,
though it is similar to \fBupdate\fP.  This mode synchronizes the
archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the
archive if the file time or size of the OS file is different, adding
new files, and deleting entries from the archive where there is
no matching file.  As this mode can delete entries from the archive,
consider making a backup copy of the archive.

Also see \fB\-DF\fP for creating difference archives.

See each option description below for details and the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section
below for examples.
.PP
\fBSplit\ archives.\fP  \fIzip\fP version 3.0 and later can create split
archives.  A
\fBsplit archive\fP is a standard zip archive split over multiple
files.  (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to
pieces, as the offsets of entries are now based on the start of each
split.  Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets,
but \fIunzip\fP can usually deal with it.  \fIzip\fP will usually refuse
to process such a spliced archive unless the \fB\-FF\fP fix option is
used to fix the offsets.)
.LP
One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple
removable media.
For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typically named (replace
ARCHIVE with the name of your archive) ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19,
ARCHIVE.zip.  Note that the last file is the \fB.zip\fP file.  In contrast,
\fBspanned archives\fP are the original multi-disk archive generally requiring
floppy disks and using volume labels to store disk numbers.  \fIzip\fP supports
split archives but not spanned archives, though a procedure exists for converting
split archives of the right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also true,
where each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to files with the
above names to create a split archive.
.LP
Use \fB\-s\fP to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is
given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB)
(the default is m).  The \fB\-sp\fP option can be used to pause \fIzip\fP between
splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions
and warnings for both \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-sp\fP below.
.LP
Though \fIzip\fP does not update split archives, \fIzip\fP provides the new
option \fB\-O\fP (\fB\-\-output\-file\fP or \fB\-\-out\fP) to allow split archives
to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c \-\-out outarchive.zip\fP
.LP
reads archive \fBinarchive.zip\fP, even if split, adds the files \fBfoo.c\fP and
\fBbar.c\fP, and writes the resulting archive to \fBoutarchive.zip\fP.  If
\fBinarchive.zip\fP is split then \fBoutarchive.zip\fP defaults to the same
split size.  Be aware that if \fBoutarchive.zip\fP and any split files that are
created with it already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without
warning.  This may be changed in the future.
.PP
\fBUnicode.\fP  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive using
a specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in archives in whatever
the local character set is.  This creates problems when an archive is created or
updated on a system using one character set and then extracted on another system
using a different character set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on
platforms that support wide characters, \fIzip\fP now stores, in addition to the
standard local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the path.
This provides a common universal character set for storing paths that allows these
paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support Unicode and to match as
close as possible on systems that don't.

On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but represented in
the local character set, it's possible that some paths will be skipped during a
local character set directory scan.  \fIzip\fP with Unicode support now can read
and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x systems and FAT file systems don't fully
support Unicode.

Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes don't
accurately show all characters due to how each operating system switches in
character sets for display.  However, directory navigation tools should show the
correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.
.PP
\fBCommand line format.\fP  This version of
.I zip
has updated command line processing and support for long options.
.PP
Short options take the form
.IP
\fC-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][\ value]\fP
.LP
where s is a one or two character short option.  A short option
that takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is
taken as the value.  If the option can be negated and "-" immediately
follows the option, the option is negated.
Short options can also be given as separate arguments
.IP
\fC-s[-][value][=value][\ value]\ -s[-][value][=value][\ value]\ ...\fP
.LP
Short options in general take values either as part of the same
argument or as the following argument.  An optional = is also supported.
So
.IP
\fC-ttmmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC-tt=mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC-tt mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
all work.  The \fB\-x\fP and \fB\-i\fP options accept lists of values
and use a slightly different format described below.  See the
\fB\-x\fP and \fB\-i\fP options.
.PP
Long options take the form
.IP
\fC--longoption[-][=value][ value]\fP
.LP
where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can
include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option
supports it), and can have a value (option argument) specified by
preceeding it with = (no spaces).  Values can also follow the
argument.  So
.IP
\fC--before-date=mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC--before-date mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
both work.

Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique
abbreviation.  See the option descriptions below for which
support long options.  To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating
a negatable option with an embedded dash ("-") at the dash
if you plan to negate it (the parser would consider
a trailing dash, such as for the option \fB\-\-some\-option\fP using
\fB\-\-some\-\fP as the option, as part of the name rather
than a negating dash).  This may be changed to force the last
dash in \fB\-\-some\-\fP to be negating in the future.

\fCzip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew

with just the files not in \fIfoofull\fP and the files where
the size or file time of the files do not match those in \fIfoofull\fP.

Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A
change in timezone since the original archive was created could
result in no times matching and all files being included.

This command should be run from the same directory from which the original

Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for the

The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other
operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two.
A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic
adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).

inconsistent entries will be left out.

option first.
.IP
If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you
must use \fB\-FF\fP.  This is a change from \fIzip\ 2.32\fP, where
the \fB\-F\fP option is able to read a truncated archive.  The
\fB\-F\fP option now more reliably fixes archives with minor
damage and the \fB\-FF\fP option is needed to fix archives where
\fB\-F\fP might have been sufficient before.
.IP
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
.B \-t
option of
.I unzip
may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered;
you can remove them from the archive using the
.B \-d
option of
\fIzip\fP.
.IP
Note that \fB\-FF\fP may have trouble fixing archives that include an
embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in the archive
and, depending on the damage, it may find the entries in the embedded
archive rather than the archive itself.  Try \fB\-F\fP first as it
does not have this problem.
.IP
The format of the fix commands have changed.  For example, to fix
the damaged archive \fIfoo.zip\fP,
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -F foo --out foofix
.RE
.IP
tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the
new archive \fIfoofix.zip\fP.  If this doesn't work, as when the
archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the archive
are missed, then try
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -FF foo --out foofixfix
.RE
.IP
and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by \fB\-F\fP.  The
\fB\-FF\fP option may create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on
what is damaged, you can then use the \fB\-F\fP option to fix that archive.
.IP
A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using
\fB\-F\fP if you have the last split of the archive (the \fB\.zip\fP file).
If this file is missing, you must use \fB\-FF\fP to fix the archive,
which will prompt you for the splits you have.

Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.
Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed
files are updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not
deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new mode that checks
entries in the archive against the file system.  If the file time and
file size of the entry matches that of the OS file, the entry is
copied from the old archive instead of being read from the file system
and compressed.  If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and
compressed as usual.  If the entry in the archive does not match a
file on the OS, the entry is deleted.  Enabling this option should
create archives that are the same as new archives, but since existing
entries are copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive
with \fB\-FS\fP can be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also
consider using \fB\-u\fP for updating an archive.
.IP
For this option to work, the archive should be updated from the same
directory it was created in so the relative paths match.  If few files
are being copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a
new archive instead.
.IP
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A

the original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use the

[VMS, WIN32] Ignore case when matching archive entries.  This option is
only available on systems where the case of files is ignored.  On systems
with case-insensitive file systems, case is normally ignored when matching files
on the file system but is not ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy),
and similar modes when matching against archive entries (currently -f
ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems where
case does matter and names that are the same except for case can exist
in an archive.  The \fB\-ic\fR option makes all matching case insensitive.
This can result in multiple archive entries matching a command line pattern.

read from a file, \fIzip\fR now issues a warning and skips line end
conversion on the file.  This check seems to catch all binary files
tested, but the original check remains and if a converted file is
later determined to be binary that warning is still issued.  A new algorithm

All input patterns must match at least one file and all input files

a file the "name not matched" warning is issued and when an input file
has been found but later is missing or not readable a missing or not
readable warning is issued.  In either case
.I zip
continues creating the archive, with missing or unreadable new files
being skipped and files already in the archive remaining unchanged.
After the archive is created, if any files were not readable
.I zip
returns the OPEN error code (18 on most systems) instead of the normal
success return (0 on most systems).  With \fB\-MM\fP set,
.I zip
exits as soon as an input pattern is not matched (whenever the
"name not matched" warning would be issued) or when an input file is
not readable.  In either case \fIzip\fR exits with an OPEN error

This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so
any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.  It is less
useful when used with wildcards, but \fIzip\fR will still exit with an

matched files are unreadable.  If you want to create the archive

Do not attempt to compress files named with the given

Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
so that
.I zip
doesn't waste its time trying to compress them.
The suffixes are separated by
either colons or semicolons.  For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo\fP
.RE
.IP
will copy everything from

.IR foo.zip ,
but will store any files that end in
.IR .Z ,
.IR .zip ,
.IR .tiff ,
.IR .gif ,
or
.I .snd
without trying to compress them
(image and sound files often have their own specialized compression methods).
By default,
.I zip
does not compress files with extensions in the list
.I .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.
Such files are stored directly in the output archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with csh:
.RS
.IP
setenv ZIPOPT "-n .gif:.zip"
.RE
.IP
To attempt compression on all files, use:
.RS

On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes (3 hex digit

Process the archive changes as usual, but instead of updating the existing archive,

without changing the existing archive and the input archive must be a different file
than the output archive.

This option can be used to create updated split archives.
It can also be used with \fB\-U\fP to copy entries from an existing archive to a new
archive.  See the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section below.

Another use is converting \fIzip\fP files from one split size to another.  For instance,
to convert an archive with 700 MB CD splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:
.RS
.IP
zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip
.RE
.IP
which uses copy mode.  See \fB\-U\fP below.  Also:
.RS
.IP
zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip
.RE
.IP
will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.

Copy mode will convert stream entries (using data descriptors and which
should be compatible with most unzips) to normal entries (which should
be compatible
with all unzips), except if standard encryption was used.  For archives
with encrypted entries, \fIzipcloak\fP will decrypt the entries and convert

You should not use

To have wildcards apply to files in subdirectories when recursing on

Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split archive is an archive
that could be split over many files.  As the archive is created, if the size of the
archive reaches the specified split size, that split is closed and the next split
opened.  In general all splits but the last will be the split size and the last
will be whatever is left.  If the entire archive is smaller than the split size a
single-file archive is created.

Split archives are stored in numbered files.  For example, if the output
archive is named \fBarchive\fP and three splits are required, the resulting
archive will be in the three files \fBarchive.z01\fP, \fBarchive.z02\fP, and
\fBarchive.zip\fP.  Do not change the numbering of these files or the archive
will not be readable as these are used to determine the order the splits are read.

Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.  Currently the
number must be an integer.  The multiplier can currently be one of
\fBk\fP (kilobytes), \fBm\fP (megabytes), \fBg\fP (gigabytes), or \fBt\fP
(terabytes).  As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers without multipliers
default to megabytes.  For example, to create a split archive called \fBfoo\fP
with the contents of the \fBbar\fP directory with splits of 670 MB that might
be useful for burning on CDs, the command:
.RS
.IP
zip -s 670m -r foo bar
.RE
.IP
could be used.

Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new
archive, but they can be specifically excluded.  If possible, keep
the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when creating
split archives.

Using \fB\-s\fP without \fB\-sp\fP as above creates all the splits where
\fBfoo\fP is being written, in this case the current directory.  This split
mode updates the splits as the archive is being created, requiring all
splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are readable by
any unzip that supports split archives.  See \fB\-sp\fP below for enabling
split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to removable
media.

The option \fB\-sv\fP can be used to enable verbose splitting and provide details of
how the splitting is being done.  The \fB\-sb\fP option can be used to ring the bell
when \fIzip\fP pauses for the next split destination.

Split archives cannot be updated, but see the \fB\-O\fP (\fB\-\-out\fP) option for
how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new archive.
A split archive can also be converted into a single-file archive using a
split size of 0 or negating the \fB\-s\fP option:

split to allow changing split destination or media.

uses stream archive format that may not be readable by some unzips.  Before
relying on splits created with \fB\-sp\fP, test a split archive with the unzip

Characters that are not valid in the current character set are
escaped as \fB#Uxxxx\fP and \fB#Lxxxxxx\fP, where x is an
ASCII character for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit
character number is sufficient to represent the Unicode character
and the second if the character needs more than 16 bits to
represent it's Unicode character code.  Setting \fB\-UN\fP to
.RS
.IP

.RE
.IP
as in
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive -sU -UN=e\fP
.RE
.IP
forces \fIzip\fP to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit
ASCII.

Normally \fIzip\fP stores UTF\-8 directly in the standard path field
on systems where UTF\-8 is the current character set and stores the
UTF\-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option
.RS
.IP
u \- UTF\-8
.RE
.IP
as in
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8\fP
.RE
.IP
forces \fIzip\fP to store UTF\-8 as native in the archive.  Note that
storing UTF\-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that support it.
This option could be useful on Windows systems where the escaped
path is too large to be a valid path and the UTF\-8 version of the
path is smaller, but native UTF\-8 is not backward compatible on
Windows systems.

Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the display of a
progress indicator during compression (see \fB-dd\fR for more on dots) and
requests verbose diagnostic info about zipfile structure oddities.
.IP
However, when
.B \-v
is the only command line argument a diagnostic screen is printed instead.  This
should now work even if stdout is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving
of the information for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.  The version
screen provides the help screen header with program name, version, and release
date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home and distribution sites, and shows
information about the target environment (compiler type and version, OS
version, compilation date and the enabled optional features used to create the

.IP
/foo/bar/file2.c
.RE

an input pattern such as
.RS

.RE
.IP
normally would match both paths, the * matching \fBdir/file1.c\fP
and \fBfile2.c\fP.  Note that in the first case a directory
boundary (/) was crossed in the match.  With \fB\-ws\fP no
directory bounds will be included in the match, making
wildcards local to a specific directory level.  So, with
\fB\-ws\fP enabled, only the second path would be matched.

When using \fB\-ws\fP, use ** to match across directory boundaries as
* does normally.

.RE
.IP
which will include the contents of
.B foo
in
.B foo.zip
while excluding all the files that end in
\fB.o\fP.
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
.I zip
at all directory levels.
.IP
Also possible:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst\fP
.RE
.IP
which will include the contents of

.B foo.zip
while excluding all the files that match the patterns in the file
\fBexclude.lst\fP.

.B \-\-no\-extra
Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid
and file times on Unix).  The zip format uses extra fields to include
additional information for each entry.  Some extra fields are specific
to particular systems while others are applicable to all systems.
Normally when \fIzip\fP reads entries from an existing archive, it
reads the extra fields it knows, strips the rest, and adds
the extra fields applicable to that system.  With \fB\-X\fP, \fIzip\fP strips
all old fields and only includes the Unicode and Zip64 extra fields
(currently these two extra fields cannot be disabled).

Negating this option, \fB\-X\-\fP, includes all the default extra fields,
but also copies over any unrecognized extra fields.

.B \-\-symlinks
For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as such in the
.I zip
archive, instead of compressing and storing the file referred to by
the link.  This can avoid multiple copies of files being included in
the archive as \fIzip\fP recurses the directory trees and accesses
files directly and by links.

.B \-\-compression\-method\ \fRcm
Set the default compression method.  Currently the main methods supported
by \fIzip\fP are \fBstore\fP and \fBdeflate\fP.  Compression method
can be set to:

\fBstore\fP \- Setting the compression method to \fBstore\fP forces
\fIzip\fP to store entries with no compression.  This is generally
faster than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.
This is the same as using \fB\-0\fP (compression level zero).

\fBdeflate\fP \- This is the default method for \fIzip\fP.  If \fIzip\fP
determines that storing is better than deflation, the entry will be
stored instead.

\fBbzip2\fP \- If \fBbzip2\fP support is compiled in, this compression
method also becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently support
the \fBbzip2\fP compression method, so test the unzip you will be using
before relying on archives using this method (compression method 12).

For example, to add \fBbar.c\fP to archive \fBfoo\fP using \fBbzip2\fP
compression:
.RS
.IP
zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c
.RE
.IP
The compression method can be abbreviated:

.B (\-0, \-1, \-2, \-3, \-4, \-5, \-6, \-7, \-8, \-9)
Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
.BR # ,
where
.B \-0
indicates no compression (store all files),
.B \-1
indicates the fastest compression speed (less compression)
and
.B \-9
indicates the slowest compression speed (optimal compression, ignores
the suffix list). The default compression level is
.BR \-6.

Though still being worked, the intention is this setting will control
compression speed for all compression methods.  Currently only
deflation is controlled.

as in:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -$ foo a: c:bar\fP
.RE
.IP
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The simplest example:
.IP
\fCzip stuff *\fP
.LP
creates the archive
.I stuff.zip
(assuming it does not exist)
and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form
(the
\fB\&.zip\fP
suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains
a dot already;
this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).
.LP
Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution,
files starting with "." are not included;
to include these as well:
.IP
\fCzip stuff .* *\fP
.LP
Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.
.LP
To zip up an entire directory, the command:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
creates the archive
.IR foo.zip ,
containing all the files and directories in the directory
.I foo
that is contained within the current directory.
.LP
You may want to make a
.I zip
archive that contains the files in
.IR foo ,
without recording the directory name,
.IR foo .
You can use the
.B \-j
option to leave off the paths,
as in:
.IP
\fCzip -j foo foo/*\fP
.LP
If you are short on disk space,
you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory
and the corresponding compressed
.I zip
archive.
In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
.B \-m
option.
If
.I foo
contains the subdirectories
.IR tom ,
.IR dick ,
and
.IR harry ,
you can:
.IP
\fCzip -rm foo foo/tom\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/dick\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/harry\fP
.LP
where the first command creates
.IR foo.zip ,
and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each
.I zip
command,
the last created archive is deleted,
making room for the next
.I zip
command to function.



.LP
Use \fB\-s\fP to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is given as
a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB).
The command
.IP
\fCzip -s 2g -r split.zip foo\fP
.LP
creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than 2\ GB each.  If
foo contained 5\ GB of contents and the contents were stored in the split archive without
compression (to make this example simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2\ GB,
split.z02 at 2\ GB, and split.zip at a little over 1\ GB.
.LP
The \fB\-sp\fP option can be used to pause \fIzip\fP between splits to allow changing
removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both \fB\-s\fP
and \fB\-sp\fP below.
.LP
Though \fIzip\fP does not update split archives, \fIzip\fP provides the new option \fB\-O\fP
(\fB\-\-output\-file\fP) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c \-\-out outarchive.zip\fP
.LP
reads archive \fBinarchive.zip\fP, even if split, adds the files \fBfoo.c\fP and
\fBbar.c\fP, and writes the resulting archive to \fBoutarchive.zip\fP.  If
\fBinarchive.zip\fP is split then \fBoutarchive.zip\fP defaults
to the same split size.  Be aware that \fBoutarchive.zip\fP and any split files
that are created with it are always overwritten without warning.  This may be changed
in the future.




.SH "PATTERN MATCHING"
This section applies only to Unix.
Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.
However, the special wildcard characters \fB*\fR and \fB[]\fR below apply
to at least MSDOS also.
.LP
The Unix shells (\fIsh\fP, \fIcsh\fP, \fIbash\fP, and others) normally
do filename substitution (also called "globbing") on command arguments.
Generally the special characters are:
.TP
.B ?
match any single character
.TP
.B *
match any number of characters (including none)
.TP
.B []
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets
(example: [a\-f], [0\-9]).  This form of wildcard matching
allows a user to specify a list of characters between square brackets and
if any of the characters match the expression matches.  For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "*.[hc]"\fP
.RE
.IP
would archive all files in the current directory that end in
\fB.h\fP or \fB.c\fP.

Ranges of characters are supported:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "[a\-f]*"\fP
.RE
.IP
would add to the archive all files starting with "a" through "f".

Negation is also supported, where any character in that position not in
the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding \fB!\fP or \fB^\fP
to the beginning of the list:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "*.[!o]"\fP
.RE
.IP
matches files that don't end in ".o".

On WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option to avoid
the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.

.LP
When these characters are encountered
(without being escaped with a backslash or quotes),
the shell will look for files relative to the current path
that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.
.LP
The
.I zip
program can do the same matching on names that are in the
.I zip
archive being modified or,
in the case of the
.B \-x
(exclude) or
.B \-i
(include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
In general, when
.I zip
encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in
the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.
If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the
.I zip
archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters
described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the
list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the
.B \-x
option, or does not match any name given with the
.B \-i
option.
.LP
The pattern matching includes the path,
and so patterns like \\*.o match names that end in ".o",
no matter what the path prefix is.
Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]),
or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes ("").
.LP
In general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths
that have wildcards to make
.I zip
do the pattern matching for file paths, and always for
paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for
\fB\-\i\fP, \fB\-x\fP, \fB\-R\fP, \fB\-d\fP, and \fB\-U\fP
and anywhere \fIzip\fP needs to process the wildcards.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

.RS
.IP 0
normal; no errors or warnings detected.
.IP 2
unexpected end of zip file.
.IP 3
a generic error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing may have
completed successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
archivers have simple work-arounds.
.IP 4
\fIzip\fP was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during
program initialization.
.IP 5
a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably
failed immediately.
.IP 6
entry too large to be processed (such as input files larger than 2 GB when
not using Zip64 or trying to read an existing archive that is too large) or
entry too large to be split with \fIzipsplit\fP
.IP 7
invalid comment format
.IP 8
\fIzip\fP -T failed or out of memory
.IP 9
the user aborted \fIzip\fP prematurely with control-C (or similar)
.IP 10
\fIzip\fP encountered an error while using a temp file
.IP 11
read or seek error
.IP 12
\fIzip\fP has nothing to do
.IP 13

.IP 19
\fIzip\fP was compiled with options not supported on this system
.RE
.PP
VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking
things, so \fIzip\fP instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  In
general, \fIzip\fP sets VMS Facility = 1955 (0x07A3), Code = 2* Unix_status,
and an appropriate Severity (as specified in ziperr.h).  More details are
included in the VMS-specific documentation.  See [.vms]NOTES.TXT and
[.vms]vms_msg_gen.c.

.SH BUGS
.I zip
3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
.I zip
1.1 to produce
.I zip
files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
.PP
.I zip
files produced by
.I zip
3.0 must not be
.I updated
by
.I zip
1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of
.I zip
or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.
The old versions can list the contents of the zip file
but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do
not have to care about this problem.
.LP
Under VMS,
not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
Only stream-LF format
.I zip
files are expected to work with
.IR zip .
Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.
This version of
.I zip
handles some of the conversion internally.
When using Kermit to transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type "set
file type block" on VMS.  When transfering from MSDOS to VMS, type
"set file type fixed" on VMS.  In both cases, type "set file type
binary" on MSDOS.
.LP
Under some older VMS versions, \fIzip\fP may hang for file
specifications that use DECnet syntax
.I foo::*.*.
.LP
On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the
32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such
as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.
.LP
Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different
EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's
a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability
to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by
.I zip
(which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.
.I zip
stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit
MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the
32-bit-mode size.

Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
.I Shrink.Pas
program, which inspired this project,
and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen;
to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the
.I zip
file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for
clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid
Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression
algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
Adler for providing a mailing list and
.I ftp
site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
.IR infozip.who )
without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
.I zip
would not have been possible.
Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator,
David Kirschbaum,
for getting us into this mess in the first place.
The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C. Rodgers and

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zipcloak
encrypts all unencrypted entries in the zipfile.  This is the default action.

.TP
The \-d option is used to decrypt encrypted entries in the zipfile.

.TP
\fIzipcloak \fBuses original zip encryption which is considered weak.

.TP
Note:
The encryption code of this program is not copyrighted and is put in
the public domain.  It was originally written in Europe and can be freely
distributed from any country including the U.S.A.  (Previously if this
program was imported into the U.S.A, it could not be re-exported from
the U.S.A to another country.)  See the file README.CR included in the
source distribution for more on this.  Otherwise, the Info-ZIP license
applies.

.SH EXAMPLES
To be added.

.SH BUGS
Large files (> 2 GB) and large archives not yet supported.

Split archives not yet supported.  A work around is to convert the
split archive to a single-file archive using \fIzip\fP and then
use \fIzipcloak\fP on the single-file archive.  If needed, the
resulting archive can then be split again using \fIzip\fP.

Zipdetails displays information about the internal record structure of the
zip file. It is not concerned with displaying any details of the compressed
data stored in the zip file.
.PP
The program assumes prior understanding of the internal structure of a Zip
file. You should have a copy of the Zip \s-1APPNOTE\s0 file at hand to help
understand the output from this program (\*(L"\s-1SEE ALSO\*(R"\s0 for details).

By default zipdetails will output the details of the zip file in three
columns.
.IP "Column 1" 5
.IX Item "Column 1"
This contains the offset from the start of the file in hex.
.IP "Column 2" 5
.IX Item "Column 2"
This contains a textual description of the field.
.IP "Column 3" 5
.IX Item "Column 3"
If the field contains a numeric value it will be displayed in hex. Zip
stored most numbers in little-endian format \- the value displayed will have
the little-endian encoding removed.
.Sp
Next, is an optional description of what the value means.
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`\-v\*(C'\fR option is present, column 1 is expanded to include
.IP "\(bu" 5
The offset from the start of the file in hex.
.IP "\(bu" 5
The length of the filed in hex.
.IP "\(bu" 5
A hex dump of the bytes in field in the order they are stored in the zip
file.
.SH "TODO"
.IX Header "TODO"
Error handling is still a work in progress.  If the program encounters a
problem reading a zip file it is likely to terminate with an unhelpful
error message.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH NAME
zipgrep \- search files in a ZIP archive for lines matching a pattern
.PD
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBzipgrep\fP [\fBegrep_options\fP] \fIpattern\fP
\fIfile\fP[\fI.zip\fP] [\fIfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|.]
[\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP\ .\|.\|.]
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIzipgrep\fP will search files within a ZIP archive for lines matching
the given string or pattern.  \fIzipgrep\fP is a shell script and requires
\fIegrep\fP(1) and \fIunzip\fP(1L) to function.  Its output is identical to
that of \fIegrep\fP(1).
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IP \fIpattern\fP
The pattern to be located within a ZIP archive.  Any string or regular
expression accepted by \fIegrep\fP(1) may be used.
.IR file [ .zip ]
Path of the ZIP archive.  (Wildcard expressions for the ZIP archive name are
not supported.)  If the literal filename is not found, the suffix \fC.zip\fR
is appended.  Note that self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any
other ZIP archive; just specify the \fC.exe\fR suffix (if any) explicitly.
.IP [\fIfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.
If no member files are specified, all members of the ZIP archive are searched.
Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members:
.RS
.IP *
matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
.IP ?
matches exactly 1 character
.IP [.\|.\|.]
matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified
by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation
point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the range of
characters within the brackets is complemented (that is, anything \fIexcept\fP
the characters inside the brackets is considered a match).
.RE
.IP
(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
modified by the operating system.)
.IP [\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.
Since wildcard characters match directory separators (`/'), this option
may be used to exclude any files that are in subdirectories.  For
example, ``\fCzipgrep grumpy foo *.[ch] -x */*\fR'' would search for the
string ``grumpy'' in all C source files in the main directory of the ``foo''
archive, but none in any subdirectories.  Without the \fB\-x\fP
option, all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be
searched.
.\" =========================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
All options prior to the ZIP archive filename are passed to \fIegrep\fP(1).

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIzipinfo\fP lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most
commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  Such information includes file access
permissions, encryption status, type of compression, version and operating
system or file system of compressing program, and the like.  The default
behavior (with no options) is
to list single-line entries for each file in the archive, with header and
trailer lines providing summary information for the entire archive.  The
format is a cross between Unix ``\fCls \-l\fR'' and ``\fCunzip \-v\fR''
output.  See
.B "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
below.  Note that \fIzipinfo\fP is the same program as \fIunzip\fP (under
Unix, a link to it); on some systems, however, \fIzipinfo\fP support may
have been omitted when \fIunzip\fP was compiled.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR file [ .zip ]
Path of the ZIP archive(s).  If the file specification is a wildcard,
each matching file is processed in an order determined by the operating
system (or file system).  Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path
itself cannot.  Wildcard expressions are similar to Unix \fIegrep\fP(1)
(regular) expressions and may contain:
.RS
.IP *
matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
.IP ?
matches exactly 1 character
.IP [.\|.\|.]
matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified
by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation
point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the range of
characters within the brackets is complemented (that is, anything \fIexcept\fP
the characters inside the brackets is considered a match).  To specify a
verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence ``[[]'' has to be used.
.RE
.IP
(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.)  If no
matches are found, the specification is assumed to be a literal filename;
and if that also fails, the suffix \fC.zip\fR is appended.  Note that
self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive;
just specify the \fC.exe\fR suffix (if any) explicitly.
.IP [\fIfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.
(VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas
instead.)
Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members; see
above.  Again, be sure to quote expressions that would otherwise be expanded
or modified by the operating system.
.IP [\fB\-x\fP\ \fIxfile(s)\fP]
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.
.\" =========================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-1
list filenames only, one per line.  This option excludes all others; headers,
trailers and zipfile comments are never printed.  It is intended for use in
Unix shell scripts.
.TP
.B \-2
list filenames only, one per line, but allow headers (\fB\-h\fP), trailers
(\fB\-t\fP) and zipfile comments (\fB\-z\fP), as well.  This option may be
useful in cases where the stored filenames are particularly long.
.TP
.B \-s
list zipfile info in short Unix ``\fCls \-l\fR'' format.  This is the default
behavior; see below.
.TP
.B \-m
list zipfile info in medium Unix ``\fCls \-l\fR'' format.  Identical to the
\fB\-s\fP output, except that the compression factor, expressed as a
percentage, is also listed.
.TP
.B \-l
list zipfile info in long Unix ``\fCls \-l\fR'' format.  As with \fB\-m\fP
except that the compressed size (in bytes) is printed instead of the
compression ratio.
.TP
.B \-v
list zipfile information in verbose, multi-page format.
.TP
.B \-h
list header line.  The archive name, actual size (in bytes) and total number
of files is printed.
.TP
.B \-M
pipe all output through an internal pager similar to the Unix \fImore\fP(1)
command.  At the end of a screenful of output, \fIzipinfo\fP pauses with a
``\-\-More\-\-'' prompt; the next screenful may be viewed by pressing the
Enter (Return) key or the space bar.  \fIzipinfo\fP can be terminated by
pressing the ``q'' key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike
Unix \fImore\fP(1), there is no forward-searching or editing capability.
Also, \fIzipinfo\fP doesn't notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the
screen, effectively resulting in the printing of two or more lines and the
likelihood that some text will scroll off the top of the screen before being
viewed.  On some systems the number of available lines on the screen is not
detected, in which case \fIzipinfo\fP assumes the height is 24 lines.
.TP
.B \-t
list totals for files listed or for all files.  The number of files listed,
their uncompressed and compressed total sizes , and their overall compression
factor is printed; or, if only the totals line is being printed, the values
for the entire archive are given.  The compressed total size does not include
the 12 additional header bytes of each encrypted entry. Note that the total
compressed (data) size will never match the actual zipfile size, since the
latter includes all of the internal zipfile headers in addition to the
compressed data.
.TP
.B \-T
print the file dates and times in a sortable decimal format (yymmdd.hhmmss).
The default date format is a more standard, human-readable version with
abbreviated month names (see examples below).
.TP
.B \-z
include the archive comment (if any) in the listing.

.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.I zipinfo
has a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather difficult to fathom
if one isn't familiar with Unix \fIls\fP(1) (or even if one is).  The default
behavior is to list files in the following format:
.PP
.X "-rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660"
.PP
The last three fields are the modification date and time of
the file, and its name.  The case of the filename is respected; thus
files that come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized.  If the file
was zipped with a stored directory name, that is also displayed as part
of the filename.
.PP
The second and third fields indicate that the file was zipped under
Unix with version 1.9 of \fIzip\fP.  Since it comes from Unix, the file
permissions at the beginning of the line are printed in Unix format.
The uncompressed file-size (2802 in this example) is the fourth field.
.PP
The fifth field consists of two characters, either of which may take
on several values.  The first character may be either `t' or `b', indicating
that \fIzip\fP believes the file to be text or binary, respectively;
but if the file is encrypted, \fIzipinfo\fP
notes this fact by capitalizing the character (`T' or `B').  The second
character may also take on four values, depending on whether there is
an extended local header and/or an ``extra field'' associated with the
file (fully explained in PKWare's APPNOTE.TXT, but basically analogous to
pragmas in ANSI C--i.e., they provide a standard way to include non-standard
information in the archive).  If neither exists, the character
will be a hyphen (`\-'); if there is an extended local header but no extra
field, `l'; if the reverse, `x'; and if both exist, `X'.  Thus the
file in this example is (probably) a text file, is not encrypted, and
has neither an extra field nor an extended local header associated with it.
The example below, on the other hand, is an encrypted binary file with an
extra field:
.PP
.X "RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644"
.PP
Extra fields are used for various purposes (see discussion of the \fB\-v\fP
option below) including the storage of VMS file attributes, which is
presumably the case here.  Note that the file attributes are listed in
VMS format.  Some other possibilities for the host operating system (which
is actually a misnomer--host file system is more correct) include
OS/2 or NT with High Performance File System (HPFS), MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT
with File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and Macintosh.  These are
denoted as follows:
.PP
.X "-rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs"
.X "-r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF"
.X "--w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr"
.PP
File attributes in the first two cases are indicated in a Unix-like format,
where the seven subfields indicate whether the file:  (1) is a directory,
(2) is readable (always true), (3) is writable, (4) is executable (guessed
on the basis of the extension--\fI.exe\fP, \fI.com\fP, \fI.bat\fP, \fI.cmd\fP
and \fI.btm\fP files are assumed to be so), (5) has its archive bit set,
(6) is hidden, and (7) is a system file.  Interpretation of Macintosh file
attributes is unreliable because some Macintosh archivers don't store any
attributes in the archive.
.PP
Finally, the sixth field indicates
the compression method and possible sub-method used.  There are six methods
known at present:  storing (no compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding,
tokenizing (never publicly released), and deflating.  In addition, there are
four levels of reducing (1 through 4); four types of imploding (4K or 8K
sliding dictionary, and 2 or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of
deflating (superfast, fast, normal, maximum compression).  \fIzipinfo\fP
represents these methods and their sub-methods as follows:  \fIstor\fP;
\fIre:1\fP, \fIre:2\fP, etc.; \fIshrk\fP; \fIi4:2\fP, \fIi8:3\fP, etc.;
\fItokn\fP; and \fIdefS\fP, \fIdefF\fP, \fIdefN\fP, and \fIdefX\fP.
.PP
The medium and long listings are almost identical to the short format except
that they add information on the file's compression.  The medium format lists
the file's compression factor as a percentage indicating the amount of space
that has been ``removed'':
.PP
.X "-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660"
.PP
In this example, the file has been compressed by more than a factor of
five; the compressed data are only 19% of the original size.  The long
format gives the compressed file's size in bytes, instead:
.PP
.X "-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660"
.PP
In contrast to the \fIunzip\fP listings, the compressed size figures in
this listing format denote the complete size of compressed data, including
the 12 extra header bytes in case of encrypted entries.
.PP
Adding the \fB\-T\fP option changes the file date and time to decimal
format:
.PP
.X "-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660"
.PP
Note that because of limitations in the MS-DOS format used to store file
times, the seconds field is always rounded to the nearest even second.
For Unix files this is expected to change in the next major releases of
\fIzip\fP(1L) and \fIunzip\fP.
.PP
In addition to individual file information, a default zipfile listing
also includes header and trailer lines:
.PP
.X "Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files"
.X ",,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents"
.X ",,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2"
.X ",,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c"
.X ",,rw,       1.0 hpf      98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def"
.X ",,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def"
.X "5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%"
.PP
The header line gives the name of the archive, its total size, and the
total number of files; the trailer gives the number of files listed,
their total uncompressed size, and their total compressed size (not
including any of \fIzip\fP's internal overhead).  If, however, one or
more \fIfile(s)\fP are provided, the header and trailer lines are
not listed.  This behavior is also similar to that of Unix's ``\fCls \-l\fR'';
it may be overridden by specifying the \fB\-h\fP and \fB\-t\fP options
explicitly.
In such a case the listing format must also be specified explicitly,
since \fB\-h\fP or \fB\-t\fP (or both) in the absence of other options implies
that ONLY the header or trailer line (or both) is listed.  See the
\fBEXAMPLES\fP section below for a semi-intelligible translation of this
nonsense.
.PP
The verbose listing is mostly self-explanatory.  It also lists file
comments and the zipfile comment, if any, and the type and number of bytes
in any stored extra fields.  Currently known types of extra fields include
PKWARE's authentication (``AV'') info; OS/2 extended attributes; VMS
filesystem info, both PKWARE and Info-ZIP versions; Macintosh resource
forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS info; and so on.  (Note
that in the case of OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps the most common
use of zipfile extra fields--the size of the stored EAs as reported by
\fIzipinfo\fP may not match the number given by OS/2's \fIdir\fP command:
OS/2 always reports the number of bytes required in 16-bit format, whereas
\fIzipinfo\fP always reports the 32-bit storage.)
.PP
Again, the compressed size figures of the individual entries include the
12 extra header bytes for encrypted entries.  In contrast, the archive total
compressed size and the average compression ratio shown in the summary
bottom line are calculated \fBwithout\fP the extra 12 header bytes of
encrypted entries.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
Modifying \fIzipinfo\fP's default behavior via options placed in
an environment variable can be a bit complicated to explain, due to
\fIzipinfo\fP's attempts to handle various defaults in an intuitive,
yet Unix-like, manner.  (Try not to laugh.)  Nevertheless, there is some
underlying logic.  In brief,
there are three ``priority levels'' of options:  the default options;
environment options, which can override or add to the defaults; and
explicit options given by the user, which can override or add to
either of the above.
.PP
The default listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly
to the "\fCzipinfo \-hst\fR" command (except when individual zipfile members
are specified).
A user who prefers the long-listing format (\fB\-l\fP) can make use of the
\fIzipinfo\fP's environment variable to change this default:
.TP
Unix Bourne shell:
\f(CW\&ZIPINFO=\-l; export ZIPINFO\fP
.TP
Unix C shell:
\f(CW\&setenv ZIPINFO \-l\fP
.TP
OS/2 or MS-DOS:
\f(CW\&set ZIPINFO=\-l\fP
.TP
VMS (quotes for \fIlowercase\fP):
\f(CW\&define ZIPINFO_OPTS "\-l"\fP
.EE
.PP
If, in addition, the user dislikes the trailer line, \fIzipinfo\fP's
concept of ``negative options'' may be used to override the default
inclusion of the line.  This is accomplished by preceding the undesired
option with one or more minuses:  e.g., ``\fC\-l\-t\fR'' or ``\fC\-\-tl\fR'',
in this example.  The first hyphen is the regular switch character, but the
one before the `t' is a minus sign.  The dual use of hyphens may seem a
little awkward, but it's reasonably intuitive nonetheless:  simply ignore
the first hyphen and go from there.  It is also consistent with the behavior
of the Unix command \fInice\fP(1).
.PP
As suggested above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS
(where the symbol used to install \fIzipinfo\fP as a foreign command
would otherwise be confused with the environment variable), and ZIPINFO
for all other operating systems.  For compatibility with \fIzip\fP(1L),
ZIPINFOOPT is also accepted (don't ask).  If both ZIPINFO and ZIPINFOOPT
are defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence.  \fIunzip\fP's diagnostic
option (\fB\-v\fP with no zipfile name) can be used to check the values
of all four possible \fIunzip\fP and \fIzipinfo\fP environment variables.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH EXAMPLES
To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete contents of a ZIP
archive \fIstorage.zip\fP, with both header and totals lines, use only
the archive name as an argument to zipinfo:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo storage
.EE
.PP
To produce a basic, long-format listing (not verbose), including header and
totals lines, use \fB\-l\fP:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-l storage
.EE
.PP
To list the complete contents of the archive without header and totals
lines, either negate the \fB\-h\fP and \fB\-t\fP options or else specify the
contents explicitly:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-\-h\-t storage
zipinfo storage \e*
.EE
.PP
(where the backslash is required only if the shell would otherwise expand
the `*' wildcard, as in Unix when globbing is turned on--double quotes around
the asterisk would have worked as well).  To turn off the totals line by
default, use the environment variable (C shell is assumed here):
.PP
.EX
setenv ZIPINFO \-\-t
zipinfo storage
.EE
.PP
To get the full, short-format listing of the first example again, given
that the environment variable is set as in the previous example, it is
necessary to specify the \fB\-s\fP option explicitly, since the \fB\-t\fP
option by itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be printed:
.PP
.EX
setenv ZIPINFO \-\-t
zipinfo \-t storage            \fR[only totals line]\fP
zipinfo \-st storage           \fR[full listing]\fP
.EE
.PP
The \fB\-s\fP option, like \fB\-m\fP and \fB\-l\fP, includes headers and
footers by default, unless otherwise specified.  Since the environment
variable specified no footers and that has a higher precedence than the
default behavior of \fB\-s\fP, an explicit \fB\-t\fP option was necessary
to produce the full listing.  Nothing was indicated about the header,
however, so the \fB\-s\fP option was sufficient.  Note that both the
\fB\-h\fP and \fB\-t\fP options, when used by themselves or with
each other, override any default listing of member files; only the header
and/or footer are printed.  This behavior is useful when \fIzipinfo\fP is
used with a wildcard zipfile specification; the contents of all zipfiles
are then summarized with a single command.
.PP
To list information on a single file within the archive, in medium format,
specify the filename explicitly:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-m storage unshrink.c
.EE
.PP
The specification of any member file, as in this example, will override
the default header and totals lines; only the single line of information
about the requested file will be printed.  This is intuitively what one
would expect when requesting information about a single file.  For multiple
files, it is often useful to know the total compressed and uncompressed
size; in such cases \fB\-t\fP may be specified explicitly:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-mt storage "*.[ch]" Mak\e*
.EE
.PP
To get maximal information about the ZIP archive, use the verbose
option.  It is usually wise to pipe the output into a filter such as
Unix \fImore\fP(1) if the operating system allows it:
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-v storage | more
.EE
.PP
Finally, to see the most recently modified files in the archive, use
the \fB\-T\fP option in conjunction with an external sorting utility
such as Unix \fIsort\fP(1) (and \fIsed\fP(1) as well, in this example):
.PP
.EX
zipinfo \-T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q
.EE
.PP
The \fB\-nr\fP option to \fIsort\fP(1) tells it to sort numerically
in reverse order rather than in textual order, and the \fB\-k\ 7\fP option
tells it to sort on the seventh field.  This
assumes the default short-listing format; if \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-l\fP is
used, the proper \fIsort\fP(1) option would be \fB\-k\ 8\fP.
Older versions of \fIsort\fP(1) do not support the \fB\-k\fP option,
but you can use the traditional \fB\+\fP option instead, e.g.,
\fB\+6\fP instead of \fB\-k\ 7\fP.  The \fIsed\fP(1)
command filters out all but the first 15 lines of the listing.  Future
releases of \fIzipinfo\fP may incorporate date/time and filename sorting
as built-in options.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH TIPS
The author finds it convenient to define an alias \fIii\fP for \fIzipinfo\fP
on systems that allow aliases (or, on other systems, copy/rename the
executable, create a link or create a command file with the name \fIii\fP).
The \fIii\fP usage parallels the common \fIll\fP alias for long listings in
Unix, and the similarity between the outputs of the two commands was
intentional.
.PD
.\" =========================================================================
.SH BUGS
As with \fIunzip\fP, \fIzipinfo\fP's \fB\-M\fP (``more'') option is overly
simplistic in its handling of screen output; as noted above, it fails to detect
the wrapping of long lines and may thereby cause lines at the top of the screen
to be scrolled off before being read.  \fIzipinfo\fP should detect and treat
each occurrence of line-wrap as one additional line printed.  This requires
knowledge of the screen's width as well as its height.  In addition,
\fIzipinfo\fP should detect the true screen geometry on all systems.
.PP
\fIzipinfo\fP's listing-format behavior is unnecessarily complex and should
be simplified.  (This is not to say that it will be.)

.RB [ \-L ]
zipfile

.SH ARGUMENTS

zipfile  Zipfile to read comments from or edit.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-w
Write comments to a zipfile from stdin (see below).
.TP
.BI \-b\ \fRpath
Use path for the temporary zip file.
.TP
.BI \-h
Show a short help.
.TP
.BI \-v
Show version information.
.TP
.BI \-L

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zipnote
writes the comments in a zipfile to stdout.  This is the default mode.  A second mode
allows updating the comments in a zipfile as well as allows changing the names
of the files in the zipfile.  These modes are described below.

.SH EXAMPLES
To write all comments in a zipfile to stdout use for example
.LP
.nf
     zipnote foo.zip > foo.tmp
.fi
.LP
This writes all comments in the zipfile
.I foo.zip
to the file
.I foo.tmp
in a specific format.

.LP
If desired, this file can then be edited to change the comments and then used
to update the zipfile.
.LP
.nf
     zipnote -w foo.zip < foo.tmp
.fi
.LP
The names of the files in the zipfile can also be changed in this way.  This is done by
following lines like
.nf
     "@ name"
.fi
in the created temporary file (called
.I foo.tmp
here) with lines like
.nf
     "@=newname"
.fi
and then using the -w option as above.

.SH BUGS
The temporary file format is rather specific and zipnote is rather picky about it.
It should be easier to change file names in a script.

Does not yet support large (> 2 GB) or split archives.

.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uncompresses files compressed by
.Xr compress 1
and recompresses them with
.Xr gzip 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Overwrite existing
.Sq .gz
files.
Unless this option is specified,
.Nm
refuses to overwrite existing files.
.It Fl t
Test integrity of the gzipped file before deleting the original file.
If the integrity check fails, the original
.Sq .Z
file is not removed.
.It Fl v
Print a report specifying the achieved compression ratios.
.It Fl 9
Use the -9 mode of
.Xr gzip 1 ,
achieving better compression at the cost of slower execution.
.It Fl K
Keep the original
.Sq .Z
file if it uses less disk blocks than the gzipped one.
A disk block is 1024 bytes.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gzip 1
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility tries to maintain the file mode of the original file.
If the original file is not writable, it is not able to do that and
.Nm
will print a warning.

\fBzprint\fP [\fB-w\fP] [\fB-s\fP] [\fB-c\fP] [\fB-h\fP] [\fB-t\fP] [\fB-d\fP] [\fB-p <pid>\fP][name]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIzprint(1)\fR displays data about Mach zones.  By default,
\fIzprint\fR will print out information about all Mach zones.  If the
optional \fIname\fR is specified, \fIzprint\fR will print information
about each zone for which \fIname\fR is a substring of the zone's
name.
.PP
\fIzprint\fR interprets the following options:
.\" ==========
.TP 8
.B \-c
(Default)
\fIzprint\fR prints zone info in columns. Long zone names are truncated
with '$', and spaces are replaced with '.', to allow for sorting by column.
Pageable and collectible zones are shown with 'P' and 'C'
on the far right. Zones with preposterously large maximum
sizes are shown with '----' in the max size and max num elts fields.
.\" ==========
.TP 8
.B \-h
(Default)
Shows headings for the columns printed with the -c option.
It may be useful to override this option when sorting by column.
.\" ==========
.TP 8
.B \-s
\fIzprint\fR sorts the zones, showing the zone wasting the most memory first.
.\" ==========
.TP 8
.B \-w
For each zone, \fIzprint\fR calculates how much space is allocated but
not currently in use, the space wasted by the zone.
.TP 8
.B \-t
For each zone, \fIzprint\fR calculates the total size of allocations from
the zone over the life of the zone.
.TP 8
.B \-d
Display deltas over time, showing any zones that have achieved a new maximum
current allocation size during the interval.  If the total allocation sizes are
being displayed for the zones in question, it will also display the deltas if the
total allocations have doubled.
.B \-p <pid>
Display zone usage related to the specified process id.  Each zone will display
standard columns and the amount of memory from that zone associated with a given
process.  The letter "A" in the flags column indicates that this total is being
accounted to the process.  Otherwise, the total is an indication of the influence
the process has on the kernel, but the memory is being accounted to the kernel proper.
.PP
Any option (including default options) can be overridden
by specifying the option in upper-case; for example, -C overrides
the (default) option -c.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
login shell and as a shell script command processor\&.  Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles \fBksh\fP but includes many enhancements\&.  Zsh
has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/metafaq.yo
.SH "AUTHOR"
Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad \fB<pf@zsh\&.org>\fP\&.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh\-workers mailing
list \fB<zsh\-workers@zsh\&.org>\fP\&.  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson \fB<pws@zsh\&.org>\fP\&.  The coordinator
can be contacted at \fB<coordinator@zsh\&.org>\fP, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites\&.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date\&.  The sites marked with \fI(H)\fP may be
mirroring \fBftp\&.cs\&.elte\&.hu\fP instead of the primary site\&.

A `wiki\&' website for zsh has been created at \fBhttp://www\&.zshwiki\&.org/\fP\&.
This is a site which can be added to and modified directly by users without
any special permission\&.  You can add your own zsh tips and configurations\&.

.SH "INVOCATION"
The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to determine
where the shell will read commands from:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-c\fP
Take the first argument as a command to execute, rather than reading commands
from a script or standard input\&.  If any further arguments are given, the
first one is assigned to \fB$0\fP, rather than being used as a positional
parameter\&.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Force shell to be interactive\&.  It is still possible to specify a
script to execute\&.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Force shell to read commands from the standard input\&.
If the \fB\-s\fP flag is not present and an argument is given,
the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute\&.
.PP
If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and neither
of the options \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-s\fP was supplied, the first argument is taken
as the file name of a script containing shell commands to be executed\&.  If
the option \fBPATH_SCRIPT\fP is set, and the file name does not contain a
directory path (i\&.e\&. there is no `\fB/\fP\&' in the name), first the current
directory and then the command path given by the variable \fBPATH\fP are
searched for the script\&.  If the option is not set or the file name
contains a `\fB/\fP\&' it is used directly\&.
.PP
After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described above,
the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters\&.
.PP
For further options, which are common to invocation and the \fBset\fP
builtin, see
\fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Options may be specified by name using the \fB\-o\fP option\&.  \fB\-o\fP acts like
a single\-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-x \-o shwordsplit scr\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
runs the script \fBscr\fP, setting the \fBXTRACE\fP option by the corresponding
letter `\fB\-x\fP\&' and the \fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option by name\&.
Options may be turned \fIoff\fP by name by using \fB+o\fP instead of \fB\-o\fP\&.
\fB\-o\fP can be stacked up with preceding single\-letter options, so for example
`\fB\-xo shwordsplit\fP\&' or `\fB\-xoshwordsplit\fP' is equivalent to
`\fB\-x \-o shwordsplit\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\fIoption\-name\fP\&'\&.  When this is done, `\fB\-\fP' characters in the
option name are permitted: they are translated into `\fB_\fP\&', and thus ignored\&.
So, for example, `\fBzsh \-\fP\fB\-sh\-word\-split\fP\&' invokes zsh with the
\fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option turned on\&.  Like other option syntaxes, options can
be turned off by replacing the initial `\fB\-\fP\&' with a `\fB+\fP'; thus
`\fB+\-sh\-word\-split\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB\-\fP\fB\-no\-sh\-word\-split\fP'\&.
Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU\-style long options cannot be stacked with
any other options, so for example `\fB\-x\-shwordsplit\fP\&' is an error,
rather than being treated like `\fB\-x \-\fP\fB\-shwordsplit\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The special GNU\-style option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-version\fP\&' is handled; it sends to
standard output the shell\&'s version information, then exits successfully\&.
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' is also handled; it sends to standard output a list of
options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits successfully\&.
.PP
Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that start with
`\fB\-\fP\&' or `\fB+\fP' to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways\&.
Firstly, a lone `\fB\-\fP\&' (or `\fB+\fP') as an argument by itself ends
option processing\&.  Secondly, a special option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' (or
`\fB+\-\fP\&'), which may be specified on its own (which is the standard
POSIX usage) or may be stacked with preceding options (so `\fB\-x\-\fP\&' is
equivalent to `\fB\-x \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&')\&.  Options are not permitted to be stacked
after `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' (so `\fB\-x\-f\fP' is an error), but note the GNU\-style
option form discussed above, where `\fB\-\fP\fB\-shwordsplit\fP\&' is permitted
and does not end option processing\&.
.PP
Except when the \fBsh\fP/\fBksh\fP emulation single\-letter options are in effect,
the option `\fB\-b\fP\&' (or `\fB+b\fP') ends option processing\&.
`\fB\-b\fP\&' is like `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP', except that further single\-letter options
can be stacked after the `\fB\-b\fP\&' and will take effect as normal\&.
.PP
.PP
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/compat.yo
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
Zsh tries to emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP when it is invoked as
\fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `\fBr\fP\&'
(assumed to stand for `restricted\&'), and if that is `\fBb\fP', `\fBs\fP' or `\fBk\fP' it
will emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP\&.  Furthermore, if invoked as \fBsu\fP (which
happens on certain systems when the shell is executed by the \fBsu\fP
command), the shell will try to find an alternative name from the \fBSHELL\fP
environment variable and perform emulation based on that\&.
.PP
In \fBsh\fP and \fBksh\fP compatibility modes the following
parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell:
\fBARGC\fP,
\fBargv\fP,
\fBcdpath\fP,
\fBfignore\fP,
\fBfpath\fP,
\fBHISTCHARS\fP,
\fBmailpath\fP,
\fBMANPATH\fP,

\fBPROMPT\fP,
\fBPROMPT2\fP,
\fBPROMPT3\fP,
\fBPROMPT4\fP,
\fBpsvar\fP,
\fBstatus\fP,
\fBwatch\fP\&.
.PP
The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed\&.  Login shells
source \fB/etc/profile\fP followed by \fB$HOME/\&.profile\fP\&.  If the
\fBENV\fP environment variable is set on invocation, \fB$ENV\fP is sourced
after the profile scripts\&.  The value of \fBENV\fP is subjected to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a pathname\&.  Note that the \fBPRIVILEGED\fP
option also affects the execution of startup files\&.
.PP
The following options are set if the shell is invoked as \fBsh\fP or
\fBksh\fP:
\fBNO_BAD_PATTERN\fP,
\fBNO_BANG_HIST\fP,
\fBNO_BG_NICE\fP,
\fBNO_EQUALS\fP,
\fBNO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP,
\fBGLOB_SUBST\fP,

.SH "RESTRICTED SHELL"
When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the letter
`\fBr\fP\&' or the `\fB\-r\fP' command line option is supplied at invocation, the
shell becomes restricted\&.  Emulation mode is determined after stripping the
letter `\fBr\fP\&' from the invocation name\&.  The following are disabled in

RESTRICTED\fP
.PP
These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files\&.  The
startup files should set up \fBPATH\fP to point to a directory of commands
which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment\&.  They may also
add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins\&.
.PP
Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
\fBRESTRICTED\fP option\&.  This immediately enables all the restrictions
described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
files\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/files.yo
.SH "STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES"
Commands are first read from \fB/etc/zshenv\fP; this cannot be overridden\&.
Subsequent behaviour is modified by the \fBRCS\fP and
\fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options; the former affects all startup files, while the
second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an
path starting with a \fB/\fP)\&.  If one of the options
is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s)
of the corresponding
type will not be read\&.  It is also possible for a file in \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP to
re\-enable \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP\&. Both \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP are set by
default\&.
.PP
Commands are then read from \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshenv\fP\&.
If the shell is a login shell, commands
are read from \fB/etc/zprofile\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zprofile\fP\&.
Then, if the shell is interactive,
commands are read from \fB/etc/zshrc\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshrc\fP\&.
Finally, if the shell is a login shell, \fB/etc/zlogin\fP and
\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogin\fP are read\&.
.PP
When a login shell exits, the files \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogout\fP and then
\fB/etc/zlogout\fP are read\&.  This happens with either an explicit exit
via the \fBexit\fP or \fBlogout\fP commands, or an implicit exit by reading
end\-of\-file from the terminal\&.  However, if the shell terminates due
to \fBexec\fP\&'ing another process, the logout files are not read\&.
These are also affected by the \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options\&.
Note also that the \fBRCS\fP option affects the saving of history files,
i\&.e\&. if \fBRCS\fP is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved\&.
.PP
If \fBZDOTDIR\fP is unset, \fBHOME\fP is used instead\&.
Files listed above as being in \fB/etc\fP may be in another
directory, depending on the installation\&.
.PP
As \fB/etc/zshenv\fP is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that
it be kept as small as possible\&.  In particular, it is a good idea to
put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind
a test of the form `\fBif [[ \-o rcs ]]; then \&.\&.\&.\fP\&' so that it will not
be executed when zsh is invoked with the `\fB\-f\fP\&' option\&.
.PP
Any of these files may be pre\-compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin
command (see \fIzshbuiltins\fP(1))\&.  If a compiled file exists (named for the original file plus the
\fB\&.zwc\fP extension) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
file will be used instead\&.

Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
login shell and as a shell script command processor\&.  Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles \fBksh\fP but includes many enhancements\&.  Zsh
has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features\&.

.SH "THE ZSH USERGUIDE"
A userguide is currently in preparation\&.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist)\&.  It can be viewed in its current state at
\fBhttp://zsh\&.sourceforge\&.net/Guide/\fP\&.  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete\&.
.SH "THE ZSH WIKI"
A `wiki' website for zsh has been created at \fBhttp://www\&.zshwiki\&.org/\fP\&.
This is a site which can be added to and modified directly by users without
any special permission\&.  You can add your own zsh tips and configurations\&.

.SH "INVOCATION"
The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to determine
where the shell will read commands from:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-c\fP
Take the first argument as a command to execute, rather than reading commands
from a script or standard input\&.  If any further arguments are given, the
first one is assigned to \fB$0\fP, rather than being used as a positional
parameter\&.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Force shell to be interactive\&.  It is still possible to specify a
script to execute\&.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Force shell to read commands from the standard input\&.
If the \fB\-s\fP flag is not present and an argument is given,
the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute\&.
.PP
If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and neither
of the options \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-s\fP was supplied, the first argument is taken
as the file name of a script containing shell commands to be executed\&.  If
the option \fBPATH_SCRIPT\fP is set, and the file name does not contain a
directory path (i\&.e\&. there is no `\fB/\fP' in the name), first the current
directory and then the command path given by the variable \fBPATH\fP are
searched for the script\&.  If the option is not set or the file name
contains a `\fB/\fP' it is used directly\&.
.PP
After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described above,
the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters\&.
.PP
For further options, which are common to invocation and the \fBset\fP
builtin, see
\fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Options may be specified by name using the \fB\-o\fP option\&.  \fB\-o\fP acts like
a single\-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-x \-o shwordsplit scr\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
runs the script \fBscr\fP, setting the \fBXTRACE\fP option by the corresponding
letter `\fB\-x\fP' and the \fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option by name\&.
Options may be turned \fIoff\fP by name by using \fB+o\fP instead of \fB\-o\fP\&.
\fB\-o\fP can be stacked up with preceding single\-letter options, so for example
`\fB\-xo shwordsplit\fP' or `\fB\-xoshwordsplit\fP' is equivalent to
`\fB\-x \-o shwordsplit\fP'\&.
.PP
Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\fIoption\-name\fP'\&.  When this is done, `\fB\-\fP' characters in the
option name are permitted: they are translated into `\fB_\fP', and thus ignored\&.
So, for example, `\fBzsh \-\fP\fB\-sh\-word\-split\fP' invokes zsh with the
\fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option turned on\&.  Like other option syntaxes, options can
be turned off by replacing the initial `\fB\-\fP' with a `\fB+\fP'; thus
`\fB+\-sh\-word\-split\fP' is equivalent to `\fB\-\fP\fB\-no\-sh\-word\-split\fP'\&.
Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU\-style long options cannot be stacked with
any other options, so for example `\fB\-x\-shwordsplit\fP' is an error,
rather than being treated like `\fB\-x \-\fP\fB\-shwordsplit\fP'\&.
.PP
The special GNU\-style option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-version\fP' is handled; it sends to
standard output the shell's version information, then exits successfully\&.
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP' is also handled; it sends to standard output a list of
options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits successfully\&.
.PP
Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that start with
`\fB\-\fP' or `\fB+\fP' to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways\&.
Firstly, a lone `\fB\-\fP' (or `\fB+\fP') as an argument by itself ends
option processing\&.  Secondly, a special option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' (or
`\fB+\-\fP'), which may be specified on its own (which is the standard
POSIX usage) or may be stacked with preceding options (so `\fB\-x\-\fP' is
equivalent to `\fB\-x \-\fP\fB\-\fP')\&.  Options are not permitted to be stacked
after `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' (so `\fB\-x\-f\fP' is an error), but note the GNU\-style
option form discussed above, where `\fB\-\fP\fB\-shwordsplit\fP' is permitted
and does not end option processing\&.
.PP
Except when the \fBsh\fP/\fBksh\fP emulation single\-letter options are in effect,
the option `\fB\-b\fP' (or `\fB+b\fP') ends option processing\&.
`\fB\-b\fP' is like `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP', except that further single\-letter options
can be stacked after the `\fB\-b\fP' and will take effect as normal\&.

.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
Zsh tries to emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP when it is invoked as
\fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `\fBr\fP'
(assumed to stand for `restricted'), and if that is `\fBb\fP', `\fBs\fP' or `\fBk\fP' it
will emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP\&.  Furthermore, if invoked as \fBsu\fP (which
happens on certain systems when the shell is executed by the \fBsu\fP
command), the shell will try to find an alternative name from the \fBSHELL\fP
environment variable and perform emulation based on that\&.
.PP
In \fBsh\fP and \fBksh\fP compatibility modes the following
parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell:
\fBARGC\fP,
\fBargv\fP,
\fBcdpath\fP,
\fBfignore\fP,
\fBfpath\fP,
\fBHISTCHARS\fP,
\fBmailpath\fP,

\fBPROMPT\fP,
\fBPROMPT2\fP,
\fBPROMPT3\fP,
\fBPROMPT4\fP,
\fBpsvar\fP,
\fBstatus\fP,
\fBwatch\fP\&.
.PP
The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed\&.  Login shells
source \fB/etc/profile\fP followed by \fB$HOME/\&.profile\fP\&.  If the
\fBENV\fP environment variable is set on invocation, \fB$ENV\fP is sourced
after the profile scripts\&.  The value of \fBENV\fP is subjected to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a pathname\&.  Note that the \fBPRIVILEGED\fP
option also affects the execution of startup files\&.
.PP
The following options are set if the shell is invoked as \fBsh\fP or
\fBksh\fP:
\fBNO_BAD_PATTERN\fP,
\fBNO_BANG_HIST\fP,
\fBNO_BG_NICE\fP,
\fBNO_EQUALS\fP,
\fBNO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP,

.SH "RESTRICTED SHELL"

These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files\&.  The
startup files should set up \fBPATH\fP to point to a directory of commands
which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment\&.  They may also
add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins\&.
.PP
Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
\fBRESTRICTED\fP option\&.  This immediately enables all the restrictions
described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
files\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/files.yo
.SH "STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES"
Commands are first read from \fB/etc/zshenv\fP; this cannot be overridden\&.
Subsequent behaviour is modified by the \fBRCS\fP and
\fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options; the former affects all startup files, while the
second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an
path starting with a \fB/\fP)\&.  If one of the options
is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s)
of the corresponding
type will not be read\&.  It is also possible for a file in \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP to
re\-enable \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP\&. Both \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP are set by
default\&.
.PP
Commands are then read from \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshenv\fP\&.
If the shell is a login shell, commands
are read from \fB/etc/zprofile\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zprofile\fP\&.
Then, if the shell is interactive,
commands are read from \fB/etc/zshrc\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshrc\fP\&.
Finally, if the shell is a login shell, \fB/etc/zlogin\fP and
\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogin\fP are read\&.
.PP
When a login shell exits, the files \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogout\fP and then
\fB/etc/zlogout\fP are read\&.  This happens with either an explicit exit
via the \fBexit\fP or \fBlogout\fP commands, or an implicit exit by reading
end\-of\-file from the terminal\&.  However, if the shell terminates due
to \fBexec\fP'ing another process, the logout files are not read\&.
These are also affected by the \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options\&.
Note also that the \fBRCS\fP option affects the saving of history files,
i\&.e\&. if \fBRCS\fP is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved\&.
.PP
If \fBZDOTDIR\fP is unset, \fBHOME\fP is used instead\&.
Files listed above as being in \fB/etc\fP may be in another
directory, depending on the installation\&.
.PP
As \fB/etc/zshenv\fP is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that
it be kept as small as possible\&.  In particular, it is a good idea to
put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind
a test of the form `\fBif [[ \-o rcs ]]; then \&.\&.\&.\fP' so that it will not
be executed when zsh is invoked with the `\fB\-f\fP' option\&.
.PP
Any of these files may be pre\-compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin
command (see \fIzshbuiltins\fP(1))\&.  If a compiled file exists (named for the original file plus the
\fB\&.zwc\fP extension) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
file will be used instead\&.

.SH "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"

Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual
entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `\fBflags\fP\&' to
avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the
behaviour of builtin commands\&.  In this introductory section,
`\fBoption\fP\&' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should
be familiar to most command line users\&.
.PP
Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (\fB\-\fP)\&.
Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following the
option letter or after white space, for example `\fBprint \-C3 *\fP\&' or
`\fBprint \-C 3 *\fP\&' are equivalent\&.  Arguments to options are not the
same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which is
which\&.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a single
word, for example `\fBprint \-ca *\fP\&' and `\fBprint \-c \-a *\fP' are
equivalent\&.
.PP
Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `\fB+\fP\&'
instead of `\fB\-\fP\&'\&.  The list below makes clear which commands these
are\&.
.PP
Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear
in a group before any non\-option arguments; once the first non\-option
argument has been found, option processing is terminated\&.
.PP
All builtin commands other than precommand modifiers, even those that
have no options, can be given the argument `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' to terminate option
processing\&.  This indicates that the following words are non\-option
arguments, but is otherwise ignored\&.  This is useful in cases where
arguments to the command may begin with `\fB\-\fP\&'\&.  For historical
reasons, most builtin commands also recognize a single `\fB\-\fP\&' in a
separate word for this purpose; note that this is less standard and
use of `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is recommended\&.
.PP

\fB\&.\fP \fIfile\fP [ \fIarg\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
Read commands from \fIfile\fP and execute them in the current shell
environment\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIfile\fP does not contain a slash, or if \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is set,
the shell looks in the components of \fB$path\fP to find the directory
containing \fIfile\fP\&.  Files in the current directory are not read
unless `\fB\&.\fP\&' appears somewhere in \fB$path\fP\&.  If a file named
`\fIfile\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP\&' is found, is newer than \fIfile\fP, and is the
compiled form (created with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin) of \fIfile\fP,
then commands are read from that file instead of \fIfile\fP\&.
.PP
If any arguments \fIarg\fP are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the \fIfile\fP is done executing\&.
If \fIfile\fP was not found the return status is 127; if \fIfile\fP was found
but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed\&.

For each \fIname\fP with a corresponding \fIvalue\fP, define an alias
with that value\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP causes the next word
to be checked for alias expansion\&.  If the \fB\-g\fP flag is present,
define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not
occur in command position\&.
.RS

If the \fB\-s\fP flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `\fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&', where
\fItext\fP is any non\-empty string, it is replaced by the text
`\fIvalue\fP \fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&'\&.  Note that \fIname\fP is treated as
a literal string, not a pattern\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP is not
special in this case\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias \-s ps=gv\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will cause the command `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' to be expanded to `\fBgv *\&.ps\fP'\&.  As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' will
then be expanded\&.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from
other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command \fBps\fP) and the two sets are never
listed together\&.
.PP
For each \fIname\fP with no \fIvalue\fP,
print the value of \fIname\fP, if any\&.  With no arguments, print all
currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases\&.  If the \fB\-m\fP flag
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases
matching these patterns are printed\&.  When printing aliases and one of
the \fB\-g\fP, \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-s\fP flags is present, restrict the printing to
global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one
which is neither a global nor a suffix alias\&.   Using `\fB+\fP\&'
instead of `\fB\-\fP\&', or ending the option list with a single
`\fB+\fP\&', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-L\fP flag is present, then print each
alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script\&.  The exit
status is nonzero if a \fIname\fP (with no \fIvalue\fP) is given for
which no alias has been defined\&.

\fB\-w\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
The flag \fB\-X\fP may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be
followed by a \fIname\fP\&.  It causes the calling function to be marked for
autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current
array of positional parameters as arguments\&.  This replaces the previous
definition of the function\&.  If no function definition is found, an error
is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading\&.
.PP
The flag \fB+X\fP attempts to load each \fIname\fP as an autoloaded function,
but does \fInot\fP execute it\&.  The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined \fIand\fP a definition for it was found\&.
This does \fInot\fP replace any existing definition of the function\&.  The
exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found\&.  In the latter case the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading\&.  If ksh\-style autoloading is
enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file
plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal
ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function\&.
If the \fB\-m\fP flag is also given each \fIname\fP is treated as a
pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the
pattern are loaded\&.
.PP
With the \fB\-w\fP flag, the \fIname\fPs are taken as names of files compiled
with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading\&.
.PP
The flags \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP mark the function to be autoloaded using the
zsh or ksh style, as if the option \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP were unset or were
set, respectively\&.  The flags override the setting of the option at the
time the function is loaded\&.
.PP
Note that the \fBautoload\fP command makes no attempt to ensure the
shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have
any particular value\&.  For this, the \fBemulate\fP command can be used:

\fBcsh\fP will never be fully emulated\&.
If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, \fBzsh\fP

argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation at startup
based on the shell name, see
the section COMPATIBILITY in \fIzsh\fP(1)
\&.  In addition to setting shell options, the command also restores
the pristine state of pattern enables, as if all patterns had been
enabled using \fBenable \-p\fP\&.
.PP
If the \fBemulate\fP command occurs inside a function that has been
marked for execution tracing with \fBfunctions \-t\fP then the \fBxtrace\fP
option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other options\&.
Note that code executed inside the function by the \fB\&.\fP, \fBsource\fP, or
\fBeval\fP commands is not considered to be running directly from the
function, hence does not provoke this behaviour\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-R\fP switch is given, all settable options
are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability
problems in scripts and functions are altered\&.  If the \fB\-L\fP switch is given,
the options \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP, \fBLOCAL_PATTERNS\fP and \fBLOCAL_TRAPS\fP
will be set as
well, causing the effects of the \fBemulate\fP command and any \fBsetopt\fP,
\fBdisable \-p\fP or \fBenable \-p\fP, and \fBtrap\fP commands to be local to
the immediately surrounding shell
function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation
modes except \fBksh\fP\&. The \fB\-L\fP switch is mutually exclusive with the
use of \fB\-c\fP in \fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
The \fIflags\fP may be any of the invocation\-time flags described in
the section INVOCATION in \fIzsh\fP(1),
except that `\fB\-o EMACS\fP\&' and `\fB\-o VI\fP' may not be used\&.  Flags such
as `\fB+r\fP\&'/`\fB+o RESTRICTED\fP' may be prohibited in some circumstances\&.
.PP
If \fB\-c\fP \fIarg\fP appears in \fIflags\fP, \fIarg\fP is evaluated while the
requested emulation is temporarily in effect\&.  In this case the emulation
mode and all options are restored to their previous values before
\fBemulate\fP returns\&.  The \fB\-R\fP switch may precede the name of the shell
to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including \fB\-R\fP in
\fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
Use of \fB\-c\fP enables `sticky\&' emulation mode for functions defined
within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is associated
thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed
the emulation (respecting the \fB\-R\fP switch, if present) and all
options are set (and pattern disables cleared)
before entry to the function, and the state is restored after exit\&.
If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an `\fBemulate\fP \fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit
from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to
standard processing such as the \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP option)\&.  This also
applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation;
the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the
function is loaded as well as when it is run\&.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBemulate sh \-c \&'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }
fno() { fni; }\&'
fno
\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The two functions \fBfni\fP and \fBfno\fP are defined with sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation\&.  \fBfno\fP is then executed, causing options associated
with emulations to be set to their values in \fBsh\fP\&.  \fBfno\fP then
calls \fBfni\fP; because \fBfni\fP is also marked for sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it\&.
Hence the option \fBcshnullglob\fP, turned off by \fBsh\fP emulation, will
be turned on within \fBfni\fP and remain on on return to \fBfno\fP\&.  On exit
from \fBfno\fP, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the
state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation\&.
.PP
The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
environment\&.  More detailed rules follow\&.
.PD 0
.TP
1\&.
The sticky emulation environment provided by `\fBemulate\fP
\fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' is identical to that provided by entry to
a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being
defined in such an environment\&.  Hence, for example, the sticky
emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within functions
with sticky emulation\&.
.TP
2\&.
No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from
functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those
that would normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation\&.
.TP
3\&.
No special handling is provided for functions marked for
\fBautoload\fP nor for functions present in wordcode created by
the \fBzcompile\fP command\&.
.TP
4\&.
The presence or absence of the \fB\-R\fP switch to \fBemulate\fP
corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example
`\fBemulate sh \-c\fP\&', `\fBemulate \-R sh \-c\fP' and `\fBemulate csh \-c\fP'
are treated as three distinct sticky emulations\&.
.TP
5\&.
Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the
basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for
example `\fBemulate zsh \-c\fP\&' and `\fBemulate zsh \-o cbases \-c\fP' are
treated as distinct sticky emulations\&.

rules are the same as used in C\&. The same escape sequences as for \fBecho\fP
are recognised in the format\&. All C conversion specifications ending in
one of \fBcsdiouxXeEfgGn\fP are handled\&. In addition to this, `\fB%b\fP\&' can be
used instead of `\fB%s\fP\&' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be
recognised and `\fB%q\fP\&' can be used to quote the argument in such a way
that allows it to be reused as shell input\&. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character,
the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to
print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression\&. See
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation\&' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)
for a description of arithmetic
expressions\&. With `\fB%n\fP\&', the corresponding argument is taken as an
identifier which is created as an integer parameter\&.
.RS
.PP
Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order
but they can explicitly specify the \fIn\fPth argument is to be used by
replacing `\fB%\fP\&' by `\fB%\fP\fIn\fP\fB$\fP' and `\fB*\fP' by `\fB*\fP\fIn\fP\fB$\fP'\&.
It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style
with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may be subject
to future change\&.
.PP
If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused
until all arguments have been consumed\&. With the \fBprint\fP builtin, this
can be suppressed by using the \fB\-r\fP option\&. If more arguments are
required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour is as if
zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument\&.

The main differences between the conditional expression syntax and the

introduce an attribute turns it off\&.
.PP
If no \fIname\fP is present, the names and values of all parameters are
printed\&.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `\fB+\fP\&'
rather than `\fB\-\fP\&' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values
of parameters when there is no parameter name\&.
.PP
If no attribute flags are given, and either no \fIname\fP arguments are
present or the flag \fB+m\fP is used, then each parameter name printed is
preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (\fBarray\fP,
\fBassociation\fP, \fBexported\fP, \fBfloat\fP, \fBinteger\fP, \fBreadonly\fP,
or \fBundefined\fP for autoloaded parameters not yet loaded)\&.  If \fB+m\fP is
used with attribute flags, and all those flags are introduced with
\fB+\fP, the matching parameter names are printed but their values
are not\&.
.PP
The following control flags change the behavior of \fBtypeset\fP:

.PD
\fB+\fP
If `\fB+\fP\&' appears by itself in a separate word as the last option,
then the names of all parameters (functions with \fB\-f\fP) are printed, but
the values (function bodies) are not\&.  No \fIname\fP arguments may appear,
and it is an error for any other options to follow `\fB+\fP\&'\&.  The
effect of `\fB+\fP\&' is as if all attribute flags which precede it were
given with a `\fB+\fP\&' prefix\&.  For example, `\fBtypeset \-U +\fP' is
equivalent to `\fBtypeset +U\fP\&' and displays the names of all arrays having
the uniqueness attribute, whereas `\fBtypeset \-f \-U +\fP\&' displays the
names of all autoloadable functions\&.  If \fB+\fP is the only option,
then type information (array, readonly, etc\&.) is also printed for each
parameter, in the same manner as `\fBtypeset +m "*"\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP
The \fB\-g\fP (global) means that any resulting parameter will not be
restricted to local scope\&.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that
the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing
parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function\&.  This flag does not
affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when listing
existing parameters, nor does the flag \fB+g\fP have any effect except in
combination with \fB\-m\fP (see below)\&.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
If the \fB\-m\fP flag is given the \fIname\fP arguments are taken as patterns
(use quoting to prevent these from being interpreted as file patterns)\&.
With no attribute flags, all parameters (or functions with the \fB\-f\fP
flag) with matching names are printed (the shell option \fBTYPESET_SILENT\fP
is not used in this case)\&.
.RS
.PP
If the \fB+g\fP flag is combined with \fB\-m\fP, a new local parameter is
created for every matching parameter that is not already local\&.  Otherwise
\fB\-m\fP applies all other flags or assignments to the existing parameters\&.
.PP
Except when assignments are made with \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP, using
\fB+m\fP forces the matching parameters and their attributes to be printed,
even inside a function\&.  Note that \fB\-m\fP is ignored if no patterns are
given, so `\fBtypeset \-m\fP\&' displays attributes but `\fBtypeset \-a +m\fP'
does not\&.

\fB\-p\fP

value will be shown for these parameters\&.

\fB\-T\fP [ \fIscalar\fP[\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP] \fIarray\fP [ \fIsep\fP ] ]
This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see below\&.
Otherwise the \fB\-T\fP option requires zero, two, or three arguments to be
present\&.  With no arguments, the list of parameters created in this
fashion is shown\&.  With two or three arguments, the first two are the name
of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied
together in the manner of \fB$PATH\fP and \fB$path\fP\&.  The optional third
argument is a single\-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as
with \fB$PATH\fP\&.  Only the first character of the separator is significant;
any remaining characters are ignored\&.
.RS
.PP
Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an initial value\&.  Both the
scalar and the array may otherwise be manipulated as normal\&.  If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too\&.  There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, nor of converting the type
of one of them with another \fBtypeset\fP command; \fB+T\fP does not work,
assigning an array to \fIscalar\fP is an error, and assigning a scalar to
\fIarray\fP sets it to be a single\-element array\&.
.PP
Note that both `\fBtypeset \-xT \&.\&.\&.\fP\&'  and `\fBexport \-T \&.\&.\&.\fP' work, but
only the scalar will be marked for export\&.  Setting the value using the
scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be quoted)\&.
It is possible to apply \fB\-T\fP to two previously tied variables but with a
different separator character, in which case the variables remain joined
as before but the separator is changed\&.

\fB\-L\fP [ \fIn\fP ]
Left justify and remove leading blanks from the value when the parameter

If \fIn\fP is nonzero, it defines the width of the field\&.
If \fIn\fP is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment\&.  In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the

Specially handled if set along with the \fB\-L\fP flag\&.
Otherwise, similar to \fB\-R\fP, except that leading zeros are used for

Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible

.TP
\fB\-a\fP
The names refer to array parameters\&.  An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may not be assigned to in the \fBtypeset\fP
statement\&.  When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are
shown\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
The names refer to functions rather than parameters\&.  No assignments
can be made, and the only other valid flags are \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-k\fP,
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP\&.  The flag \fB\-t\fP turns on execution tracing
for this function; the flag \fB\-T\fP does the same, but turns off tracing
on any function called from the present one, unless that function also
has the \fB\-t\fP or \fB\-T\fP flag\&.  The \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-U\fP flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; \fB\-U\fP also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded\&.  The \fBfpath\fP
parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the
function is first referenced; see the section `Functions\&'\&. The \fB\-k\fP and
\fB\-z\fP flags make the function be loaded using ksh\-style or zsh\-style
autoloading respectively\&. If neither is given, the setting of the
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option determines how the function is loaded\&.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `<S>\&' in the table in
\fIzshparam\fP(1)), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others\&.  A special parameter with this attribute will
not retain its special effect when made local\&.  Thus after `\fBtypeset \-h
PATH\fP\&', a function containing `\fBtypeset PATH\fP' will create an ordinary
local parameter without the usual behaviour of \fBPATH\fP\&.  Alternatively,
the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a
function `\fBtypeset \-h PATH\fP\&' creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special \fBPATH\fP parameter is not altered in any way\&.  It is also possible
to create a local parameter using `\fBtypeset +h \fP\fIspecial\fP\&', where the
local copy of \fIspecial\fP will retain its special properties regardless of
having the \fB\-h\fP attribute\&.  Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in \fBzsh/mapfile\fP and \fBzsh/parameter\fP) are
automatically given the \fB\-h\fP attribute to avoid name clashes\&.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Hide value: specifies that \fBtypeset\fP will not display the value of the
parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the `\fB+\fP\&' flag had been given\&.  Use of the parameter is
in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the \fB\-m\fP option\&.  This is on by
default for the parameters in the \fBzsh/parameter\fP and \fBzsh/mapfile\fP
modules\&.  Note, however, that unlike the \fB\-h\fP flag this is also useful
for non\-special parameters\&.

Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping, i\&.e\&. if the

is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into \fIfile\fP\&.  If both \fB\-c\fP and
\fB\-a\fP are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
for autoloading may be given\&.  In either case, the functions in files
written with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP option will be autoloaded as if the
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option were unset\&.
.PP
The reason for handling loaded and not\-yet\-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function\&.  In such cases the output of
`\fBzcompile \-c\fP\&' does not include the additional functions defined in
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost\&.  Using
`\fBzcompile \-a\fP\&' captures all this extra information\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fP option is combined with \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP,
the \fIname\fPs are used as patterns and all functions whose names
match one of these patterns will be written\&. If no \fIname\fP is given,
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written\&.
.PP
Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that
include redirections as part of the definition rather than within
the body of the function; for example
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfn1() { { \&.\&.\&. } >~/logfile }\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
can be compiled but
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfn1() { \&.\&.\&. } >~/logfile\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
cannot\&.  It is possible to use the first form of \fBzcompile\fP to compile
autoloadable functions that include the full function definition instead
of just the body of the function\&.
.PP
The third form, with the \fB\-t\fP option, examines an existing
compiled file\&.  Without further arguments, the names of the original
files compiled into it are listed\&.  The first line of output shows
the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file
will be used (i\&.e\&. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory)\&.
With arguments, nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for \fIall\fP \fIname\fPs were found in the compiled
file, and non\-zero if the definition for at least one \fIname\fP was not
found\&.

When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the
shell\&'s memory, rather than memory\-mapped (see \fB\-M\fP)\&.  This
happens automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping\&.
.RS
.PP
When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is
often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
code to define functions which have already been defined, will
remain mapped, consequently wasting memory\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
The compiled file is mapped into the shell\&'s memory when read\&. This
is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running
on the same host will share this mapped file\&.  If neither \fB\-R\fP nor
\fB\-M\fP is given, the \fBzcompile\fP builtin decides what to do based
on the size of the compiled file\&.
.TP
.PD 0
\fB\-k\fP
.TP
.PD
\fB\-z\fP
These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which
are to be autoloaded\&. If \fB\-z\fP is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option is
\fInot\fP set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is
read, while if the \fB\-k\fP is given, the function will be loaded as if
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP \fIis\fP set\&.  These options also take precedence over
any \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP options specified to the \fBautoload\fP builtin\&. If
neither of these options is given, the function will be loaded as
determined by the setting of the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option at the time
the compiled file is read\&.
 
These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
\fIname\fPs to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to
the next \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP\&.

The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
format, one for big\-endian machines and one for small\-endian
machines\&.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine
independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file
is actually used (and mapped)\&.

Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are

In the simplest case, \fBzmodload\fP loads a binary module\&.  The module must
be in a file with a name consisting of the specified \fIname\fP followed by
a standard suffix, usually `\fB\&.so\fP\&' (`\fB\&.sl\fP' on HPUX)\&.
If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module is
ignored\&.  If \fBzmodload\fP detects an inconsistency, such as an
invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is 
aborted\&.   Hence `\fBzmodload\fP \fImodule\fP \fB2>/dev/null\fP\&' is sufficient
to test whether a module is available\&.
If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it
is not available, non\-zero status is silently returned\&.  The option
\fB\-i\fP is accepted for compatibility but has no effect\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIname\fPd module is searched for in the same way a command is, using
\fB$module_path\fP instead of \fB$path\fP\&.  However, the path search is

There is no way to prevent the path search\&.
.PP
If the module supports features (see below), \fBzmodload\fP tries to

With \fB\-u\fP, \fBzmodload\fP unloads modules\&.  The same \fIname\fP
must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not
necessary for the module to exist in the file system\&.
The \fB\-i\fP option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded)\&.

\fBzmodload \-F\fP [ \fB\-almLe\fP \fB\-P\fP \fIparam\fP ] \fImodule\fP [ [\fB+\-\fP]\fIfeature\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
\fBzmodload \-F\fP allows more selective control over the features provided
by modules\&.  With no options apart from \fB\-F\fP, the module named
\fImodule\fP is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the list of
\fIfeature\fPs is set to the required state\&.  If no 
\fIfeature\fPs are specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, but the state of features is unchanged\&.  Each feature
may be preceded by a \fB+\fP to turn the feature on, or \fB\-\fP to turn it
off; the \fB+\fP is assumed if neither character is present\&.
Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current state;
if the module was not previously loaded this means any such features will
remain disabled\&.  The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features could
not be set (for example, a parameter couldn\&'t be added because there
was a different parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded\&.
.RS
.PP
The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math
functions; these are indicated by the prefix `\fBb:\fP\&', `\fBc:\fP'
(`\fBC:\fP\&' for an infix condition), `\fBp:\fP' and `\fBf:\fP', respectively,
followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have in the
shell\&.  For example, `\fBb:strftime\fP\&' indicates a builtin named
\fBstrftime\fP and \fBp:EPOCHSECONDS\fP indicates a parameter named
\fBEPOCHSECONDS\fP\&.  The module may provide other (`abstract\&') features of
its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix\&.
.PP
With \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP, features provided by the module are listed\&.  With
\fB\-l\fP alone, a list of features together with their states is shown, one
feature per line\&.  With \fB\-L\fP alone, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would
cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is shown\&.  With
\fB\-lL\fP, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would cause all the features to be
set to their current state is shown\&.  If one of these combinations is given
with the option \fB\-P\fP \fIparam\fP then the parameter \fIparam\fP is set to an
array of features, either features together with their state or (if
\fB\-L\fP alone is given) enabled features\&.
.PP
With the option \fB\-L\fP the module name may be omitted; then a list
of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed
in the form of \fBzmodload \-F\fP commands\&.  If \fB\-l\fP is also given,
the state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form\&.
.PP
A set of features may be provided together with \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP and a
module name; in that case only the state of those features is
considered\&.  Each feature may be preceded by \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP but the
character has no effect\&.  If no set of features is provided, all
features are considered\&.
.PP
With \fB\-e\fP, the command first tests that the module is loaded;
if it is not, status 1 is returned\&.  If the module is loaded,
the list of features given as an argument is examined\&.  Any feature
given with no prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it;
any feature given with a prefix \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP is tested to
see if is provided and in the given state\&.  If the tests on all features
in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1\&.
.PP
With \fB\-m\fP, each entry in the given list of features is taken
as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided
by the module\&.  An initial \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP must be given explicitly\&.
This may not be combined with the \fB\-a\fP option as autoloads must
be specified explicitly\&.
.PP
With \fB\-a\fP, the given list of features is marked for autoload from
the specified module, which may not yet be loaded\&.  An optional \fB+\fP
may appear before the feature name\&.  If the feature is prefixed with
\fB\-\fP, any existing autoload is removed\&.  The options \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP
may be used to list autoloads\&.  Autoloading is specific to individual
features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled\&.  Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit `\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP \fImodule\fP
\fB\-\fP\fIfeature\fP\&' is issued\&.  It is not an error to request an autoload
for a feature of a module that is already loaded\&.
.PP
When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the features
actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the
autoload request is deleted\&.  A warning message is output; if the
module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload
is successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command\&.
If the module is already loaded at the time when \fBzmodload \-Fa\fP is
run, an error message is printed and status 1 returned\&.
.PP
\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP can be used with the \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, \fB\-e\fP and
\fB\-P\fP options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable
features\&.  In this case \fB\-l\fP is ignored if \fB\-L\fP is specified\&.
\fBzmodload \-FaL\fP with no module name lists autoloads for all modules\&.

When listing, if the \fB\-L\fP flag was also given, list the definition as a

.RS
.PP
The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether
the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists,
loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
\fBzmodload \-R\fP or by redefining the alias\&.  Chains of aliases (i\&.e\&. where
the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
not circular\&.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they
may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any
part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first\&.  For
example, `\fBany/old/alias\fP\&' is always a valid alias\&.
.PP
Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved
module; these remain if the alias is removed\&.  It is valid to create an
alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to
a different module\&.  However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will
already be marked as a loadable module in its own right\&.
.PP
Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the \fBzmodload\fP command
anywhere module names are required\&.  However, aliases will not be
shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `\fBzmodload\fP\&'\&.

Note that \fBzsh\fP makes no distinction between modules that were linked

Control the editor\&'s completion behavior according to the supplied set
of \fIoptions\fP\&.  Various editing commands, notably
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\-word\fP, usually bound to tab, will
attempt to complete a word typed by the user, while others, notably
\fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP, usually bound to ^D in EMACS editing
mode, list the possibilities; \fBcompctl\fP controls what those
possibilities are\&.  They may for example be filenames (the most common
case, and hence the default), shell variables, or words from a
user\-specified list\&.
.PP
.SH "COMMAND FLAGS"
Completion of the arguments of a command may be different for each
command or may use the default\&.  The behavior when completing the
command word itself may also be separately specified\&.  These
correspond to the following flags and arguments, all of which (except
for \fB\-L\fP) may be combined with any combination of the
\fIoptions\fP described subsequently in the section `Option Flags\&':
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fIcommand\fP \&.\&.\&.
controls completion for the named commands, which must be listed last
on the command line\&.  If completion is attempted for a command with a
pathname containing slashes and no completion definition is found, the
search is retried with the last pathname component\&. If the command starts
with a \fB=\fP, completion is tried with the pathname of the command\&.
.RS
.PP
Any of the \fIcommand\fP strings may be patterns of the form normally
used for filename generation\&.  These should be quoted to protect them
from immediate expansion; for example the command string \fB\&'foo*'\fP
arranges for completion of the words of any command beginning with
\fBfoo\fP\&.  When completion is attempted, all pattern completions are
tried in the reverse order of their definition until one matches\&.  By
default, completion then proceeds as normal, i\&.e\&. the shell will try to
generate more matches for the specific command on the command line; this
can be overridden by including \fB\-tn\fP in the flags for the pattern
completion\&.
.PP
Note that aliases
are expanded before the command name is determined unless the
\fBCOMPLETE_ALIASES\fP option is set\&.  Commands may not be combined
with the \fB\-C\fP, \fB\-D\fP or \fB\-T\fP flags\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
controls completion when the command word itself is being completed\&.
If no \fBcompctl \-C\fP command has been issued,  the names of any
executable command (whether in the path or specific to the shell, such
as aliases or functions) are completed\&.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
controls default completion behavior for the arguments of commands not
assigned any special behavior\&.  If no \fBcompctl \-D\fP command has
been issued, filenames are completed\&.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
supplies completion flags to be used before any other processing is
done, even before processing for \fBcompctl\fPs defined for specific
commands\&.  This is especially useful when combined with extended
completion (the \fB\-x\fP flag, see the section `Extended Completion\&' below)\&.
Using this flag you can define default behavior
which will apply to all commands without exception, or you can alter
the standard behavior for all commands\&.  For example, if your access
to the user database is too slow and/or it contains too many users (so
that completion after `\fB~\fP\&' is too slow to be usable), you can use
.RS

to complete the strings in the array \fBfriends\fP after a `\fB~\fP\&'\&.
The \fBC[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP argument is necessary so that this form of
\fB~\fP\-completion is
not tried after the directory name is finished\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
lists the existing completion behavior in a manner suitable for
putting into a start\-up script; the existing behavior is not changed\&.
Any combination of the above forms, or the \fB\-M\fP flag (which must
follow the \fB\-L\fP flag), may be specified, otherwise all defined
completions are listed\&.  Any other flags supplied are ignored\&.
.TP
\fIno argument\fP
If no argument is given, \fBcompctl\fP lists all defined completions
in an abbreviated form;  with a list of \fIoptions\fP, all completions
with those flags set (not counting extended completion) are listed\&.
.PP
If the \fB+\fP flag is alone and followed immediately by the \fIcommand\fP
list, the completion behavior for all the commands in the list is reset to
the default\&.  In other words, completion will subsequently use the
options specified by the \fB\-D\fP flag\&.
.PP
The form with \fB\-M\fP as the first and only option defines global
matching specifications (see
zshcompwid)\&. The match specifications given will be used for every completion
attempt (only when using \fBcompctl\fP, not with the new completion
system) and are tried in the order in which they are defined until one 
generates at least one match\&. E\&.g\&.:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompctl \-M \&'' 'm:{a\-zA\-Z}={A\-Za\-z}'\fP
.fi
.RE

This will first try completion without any global match specifications 
(the empty string) and, if that generates no matches, will try case
insensitive completion\&.

.TP
\fB\-g\fP \fIglobstring\fP
The \fIglobstring\fP is expanded using filename globbing; it should be
quoted to protect it from immediate expansion\&. The resulting
filenames are taken as the possible completions\&.  Use `\fB*(/)\fP\&' instead of
`\fB*/\fP\&' for directories\&.  The \fBfignore\fP special parameter is not
applied to the resulting files\&.  More than one pattern may be given
separated by blanks\&. (Note that brace expansion is \fInot\fP part of
globbing\&.  Use the syntax `\fB(either|or)\fP\&' to match alternatives\&.)
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIsubststring\fP
The \fIsubststring\fP is split into words and these words are than
expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see
\fIzshexpn\fP(1))\&.  The resulting words are taken as possible
completions\&.  The \fBfignore\fP special parameter is not applied to the
resulting files\&.  Note that \fB\-g\fP is faster for filenames\&.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP \fIfunction\fP
Call the given function to get the completions\&.  Unless the name
starts with an underscore, the function is
passed two arguments: the prefix and the suffix of the word on which
completion is to be attempted, in other words those characters before
the cursor position, and those from the cursor position onwards\&.  The
whole command line can be accessed with the \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-l\fP flags
of the \fBread\fP builtin\&. The
function should set the variable \fBreply\fP to an array containing
the completions (one completion per element); note that \fBreply\fP
should not be made local to the function\&.  From such a function the
command line can be accessed with the \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-l\fP flags to
the \fBread\fP builtin\&.  For example,
