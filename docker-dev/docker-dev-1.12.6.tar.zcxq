affix can be part of a compound word at the end,
  middle, start, etc.  The flags are combined with the flags of the basic
  word.  |spell-compound|
- NEEDAFFIX: another affix is needed to make a valid word.
- CIRCUMFIX, as explained just below.


IGNOREEXTRA						*spell-IGNOREEXTRA*

Normally Vim gives an error for an extra field that does not start with '#'.
This avoids errors going unnoticed.  However, some files created for Myspell
or Hunspell may contain many entries with an extra field.  Use the IGNOREEXTRA
flag to avoid lots of errors.


CIRCUMFIX						*spell-CIRCUMFIX*

The CIRCUMFIX flag means a prefix and suffix must be added at the same time.
If a prefix has the CIRCUMFIX flag than only suffixes with the CIRCUMFIX flag
can be added, and the other way around.
An alternative is to only specify the suffix, and give the that suffix two
flags: The required prefix and the NEEDAFFIX flag.  |spell-NEEDAFFIX|


PFXPOSTPONE						*spell-PFXPOSTPONE*

When an affix file has very many prefixes that apply to many words it's not
possible to build the whole word list in memory.  This applies to Hebrew (a
list with all words is over a Gbyte).  In that case applying prefixes must be
postponed.  This makes spell checking slower.  It is indicated by this keyword
in the .aff file:

	PFXPOSTPONE ~

Only prefixes without a chop string and without flags can be postponed.
Prefixes with a chop string or with flags will still be included in the word
list.  An exception if the chop string is one character and equal to the last
character of the added string, but in lower case.  Thus when the chop string
is used to allow the following word to start with an upper case letter.


WORDS WITH A SLASH					*spell-SLASH*

The slash is used in the .dic file to separate the basic word from the affix
letters and other flags.  Unfortunately, this means you cannot use a slash in
a word.  Thus "TCP/IP" is not a word but "TCP" with the flags "IP".  To include
a slash in the word put a backslash before it: "TCP\/IP".  In the rare case
you want to use a backslash inside a word you need to use two backslashes.
Any other use of the backslash is reserved for future expansion.


KEEP-CASE WORDS						*spell-KEEPCASE*

In the affix file a KEEPCASE line can be used to define the affix name used
for keep-case words.  Example:

	KEEPCASE = ~

This flag is not supported by Myspell.  It has the meaning that case matters.
This can be used if the word does not have the first letter in upper case at
the start of a sentence.  Example:

    word list	    matches		    does not match ~
    's morgens/=    's morgens		    'S morgens 's Morgens 'S MORGENS
    's Morgens	    's Morgens 'S MORGENS   'S morgens 's morgens

The flag can also be used to avoid that the word matches when it is in all
upper-case letters.


RARE WORDS						*spell-RARE*

In the affix file a RARE line can be used to define the affix name used for
rare words.  Example:

	RARE ? ~

Rare words are highlighted differently from bad words.  This is to be used for
words that are correct for the language, but are hardly ever used and could be
a typing mistake anyway.  When the same word is found as good it won't be
highlighted as rare.

This flag can also be used on an affix, so that a basic word is not rare but
the basic word plus affix is rare |spell-affix-flags|.  However, if the word
also appears as a good word in another way (e.g., in another region) it won't
be marked as rare.


BAD WORDS						*spell-BAD*

In the affix file a BAD line can be used to define the affix name used for
bad words.  Example:

	BAD ! ~

This can be used to exclude words that would otherwise be good.  For example
"the the" in the .dic file:

	the the/! ~

Once a word has been marked as bad it won't be undone by encountering the same
word as good.

The flag also applies to the word with affixes, thus this can be used to mark
a whole bunch of related words as bad.

							*spell-FORBIDDENWORD*
FORBIDDENWORD can be used just like BAD.  For compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-NEEDAFFIX*
The NEEDAFFIX flag is used to require that a word is used with an affix.  The
word itself is not a good word (unless there is an empty affix).  Example:

	NEEDAFFIX + ~


COMPOUND WORDS						*spell-compound*

A compound word is a longer word made by concatenating words that appear in
the .dic file.  To specify which words may be concatenated a character is
used.  This character is put in the list of affixes after the word.  We will
call this character a flag here.  Obviously these flags must be different from
any affix IDs used.

							*spell-COMPOUNDFLAG*
The Myspell compatible method uses one flag, specified with COMPOUNDFLAG.  All
words with this flag combine in any order.  This means there is no control
over which word comes first.  Example:
	COMPOUNDFLAG c ~

							*spell-COMPOUNDRULE*
A more advanced method to specify how compound words can be formed uses
multiple items with multiple flags.  This is not compatible with Myspell 3.0.
Let's start with an example:
	COMPOUNDRULE c+ ~
	COMPOUNDRULE se ~

The first line defines that words with the "c" flag can be concatenated in any
order.  The second line defines compound words that are made of one word with
the "s" flag and one word with the "e" flag.  With this dictionary:
	bork/c ~
	onion/s ~
	soup/e ~

You can make these words:
	bork
	borkbork
	borkborkbork
	(etc.)
	onion
	soup
	onionsoup

The COMPOUNDRULE item may appear multiple times.  The argument is made out of
one or more groups, where each group can be:
	one flag			e.g., c
	alternate flags inside []	e.g., [abc]
Optionally this may be followed by:
	*	the group appears zero or more times, e.g., sm*e
	+	the group appears one or more times, e.g., c+
	?	the group appears zero times or once, e.g., x?

This is similar to the regexp pattern syntax (but not the same!).  A few
examples with the sequence of word flags they require:
    COMPOUNDRULE x+	    x xx xxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yz	    yz
    COMPOUNDRULE x+z	    xz xxz xxxz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yx+	    yx yxx yxxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE xy?z	    xz xyz

    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]z    az bz cz
    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]+z   az aaz abaz bz baz bcbz cz caz cbaz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE a[xyz]+   ax axx axyz ay ayx ayzz az azy azxy etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE sm*e	    se sme smme smmme etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE s[xyz]*e  se sxe sxye sxyxe sye syze sze szye szyxe  etc.

A specific example: Allow a compound to be made of two words and a dash:
	In the .aff file:
	    COMPOUNDRULE sde ~
	    NEEDAFFIX x ~
	    COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~
	    COMPOUNDMIN 1 ~
	In the .dic file:
	    start/s ~
	    end/e ~
	    -/xd ~

This allows for the word "start-end", but not "startend".

An additional implied rule is that, without further flags, a word with a
prefix cannot be compounded after another word, and a word with a suffix
cannot be compounded with a following word.  Thus the affix cannot appear
on the inside of a compound word.  This can be changed with the
|spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.

							*spell-NEEDCOMPOUND*
The NEEDCOMPOUND flag is used to require that a word is used as part of a
compound word.  The word itself is not a good word.  Example:

	NEEDCOMPOUND & ~

							*spell-ONLYINCOMPOUND*
The ONLYINCOMPOUND does exactly the same as NEEDCOMPOUND.  Supported for
compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDMIN*
The minimal character length of a word used for compounding is specified with
COMPOUNDMIN.  Example:
	COMPOUNDMIN 5 ~

When omitted there is no minimal length.  Obviously you could just leave out
the compound flag from short words instead, this feature is present for
compatibility with Myspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDWORDMAX*
The maximum number of words that can be concatenated into a compound word is
specified with COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~

When omitted there is no maximum.  It applies to all compound words.

To set a limit for words with specific flags make sure the items in
COMPOUNDRULE where they appear don't allow too many words.

							*spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX*
The maximum number of syllables that a compound word may contain is specified
with COMPOUNDSYLMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDSYLMAX 6 ~

This has no effect if there is no SYLLABLE item.  Without COMPOUNDSYLMAX there
is no limit on the number of syllables.

If both COMPOUNDWORDMAX and COMPOUNDSYLMAX are defined, a compound word is
accepted if it fits one of the criteria, thus is either made from up to
COMPOUNDWORDMAX words or contains up to COMPOUNDSYLMAX syllables.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG*
The COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix cannot be used in a compound word.  Example:
	affix file:
		COMPOUNDFLAG c ~
		COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG x ~
		SFX a Y 2 ~
		SFX a 0 s   . ~
		SFX a 0 ize/x . ~
	dictionary:
		word/c ~
		util/ac ~

This allows for "wordutil" and "wordutils" but not "wordutilize".
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG*
The COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix can also be used in a compound word in a way
where the affix ends up halfway the word.  Without this flag that is not
allowed.
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDROOT*
The COMPOUNDROOT flag is used for words in the dictionary that are already a
compound.  This means it counts for two words when checking the compounding
rules.  Can also be used for an affix to count the affix as a compounding
word.

						*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN*
CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN is used to define patterns that, when matching at the
position where two words are compounded together forbids the compound.
For example:
	CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN o e ~

This forbids compounding if the first word ends in "o" and the second word
starts with "e".

The arguments must be plain text, no patterns are actually supported, despite
the item name.  Case is always ignored.

The Hunspell feature to use three arguments and flags is not supported.

							*spell-SYLLABLE*
The SYLLABLE item defines characters or character sequences that are used to
count the number of syllables in a word.  Example:
	SYLLABLE aáeéiíoóöõuúüûy/aa/au/ea/ee/ei/ie/oa/oe/oo/ou/uu/ui ~

Before the first slash is the set of characters that are counted for one
syllable, also when repeated and mixed, until the next character that is not
in this set.  After the slash come sequences of characters that are counted
for one syllable.  These are preferred over using characters from the set.
With the example "ideeen" has three syllables, counted by "i", "ee" and "e".

Only case-folded letters need to be included.

Another way to restrict compounding was mentioned above: Adding the
|spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag to an affix causes all words that are made
with that affix to not be used for compounding.


UNLIMITED COMPOUNDING					*spell-NOBREAK*

For some languages, such as Thai, there is no space in between words.  This
looks like all words are compounded.  To specify this use the NOBREAK item in
the affix file, without arguments:
	NOBREAK ~

Vim will try to figure out where one word ends and a next starts.  When there
are spelling mistakes this may not be quite right.


							*spell-COMMON*
Common words can be specified with the COMMON item.  This will give better
suggestions when editing a short file.  Example:

	COMMON  the of to and a in is it you that he was for on are ~

The words must be separated by white space, up to 25 per line.
When multiple regions are specified in a ":mkspell" command the common words
for all regions are combined and used for all regions.

							*spell-NOSPLITSUGS*
This item indicates that splitting a word to make suggestions is not a good
idea.  Split-word suggestions will appear only when there are few similar
words.

	NOSPLITSUGS ~

							*spell-NOSUGGEST*
The flag specified with NOSUGGEST can be used for words that will not be
suggested.  Can be used for obscene words.

	NOSUGGEST % ~


REPLACEMENTS						*spell-REP*

In the affix file REP items can be used to define common mistakes.  This is
used to make spelling suggestions.  The items define the "from" text and the
"to" replacement.  Example:

	REP 4 ~
	REP f ph ~
	REP ph f ~
	REP k ch ~
	REP ch k ~

The first line specifies the number of REP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but it must be there (for compatibility with Myspell).

Don't include simple one-character replacements or swaps.  Vim will try these
anyway.  You can include whole words if you want to, but you might want to use
the "file:" item in 'spellsuggest' instead.

You can include a space by using an underscore:

	REP the_the the ~


SIMILAR CHARACTERS					*spell-MAP* *E783*

In the affix file MAP items can be used to define letters that are very much
alike.  This is mostly used for a letter with different accents.  This is used
to prefer suggestions with these letters substituted.  Example:

	MAP 2 ~
	MAP eéëêè ~
	MAP uüùúû ~

The first line specifies the number of MAP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but the line must be there.

Each letter must appear in only one of the MAP items.  It's a bit more
efficient if the first letter is ASCII or at least one without accents.


.SUG FILE						*spell-NOSUGFILE*

When soundfolding is specified in the affix file then ":mkspell" will normally
produce a .sug file next to the .spl file.  This file is used to find
suggestions by their sound-a-like form quickly.  At the cost of a lot of
memory (the amount depends on the number of words, |:mkspell| will display an
estimate when it's done).

To avoid producing a .sug file use this item in the affix file:

	NOSUGFILE ~

Users can simply omit the .sug file if they don't want to use it.


SOUND-A-LIKE						*spell-SAL*

In the affix file SAL items can be used to define the sounds-a-like mechanism
to be used.  The main items define the "from" text and the "to" replacement.
Simplistic example:

	SAL CIA			 X ~
	SAL CH			 X ~
	SAL C			 K ~
	SAL K			 K ~

There are a few rules and this can become quite complicated.  An explanation
how it works can be found in the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-Code.html.

There are a few special items:

	SAL followup		true ~
	SAL collapse_result	true ~
	SAL remove_accents	true ~

"1" has the same meaning as "true".  Any other value means "false".


SIMPLE SOUNDFOLDING				*spell-SOFOFROM* *spell-SOFOTO*

The SAL mechanism is complex and slow.  A simpler mechanism is mapping all
characters to another character, mapping similar sounding characters to the
same character.  At the same time this does case folding.  You can not have
both SAL items and simple soundfolding.

There are two items required: one to specify the characters that are mapped
and one that specifies the characters they are mapped to.  They must have
exactly the same number of characters.  Example:

    SOFOFROM abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ~
    SOFOTO   ebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkesebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkes ~

In the example all vowels are mapped to the same character 'e'.  Another
method would be to leave out all vowels.  Some characters that sound nearly
the same and are often mixed up, such as 'm' and 'n', are mapped to the same
character.  Don't do this too much, all words will start looking alike.

Characters that do not appear in SOFOFROM will be left out, except that all
white space is replaced by one space.  Sequences of the same character in
SOFOFROM are replaced by one.

You can use the |soundfold()| function to try out the results.  Or set the
'verbose' option to see the score in the output of the |z=| command.


UNSUPPORTED ITEMS				*spell-affix-not-supported*

These items appear in the affix file of other spell checkers.  In Vim they are
ignored, not supported or defined in another way.

ACCENT		(Hunspell)				*spell-ACCENT*
		Use MAP instead. |spell-MAP|

BREAK		(Hunspell)				*spell-BREAK*
		Define break points.  Unclear how it works exactly.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE*
		Disallow uppercase letters at compound word boundaries.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP*
		Disallow using the same word twice in a compound.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDREP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDREP*
		Something about using REP items and compound words.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE*
		Forbid three identical characters when compounding.  Not
		supported.

COMPLEXPREFIXES  (Hunspell)				*spell-COMPLEXPREFIXES*
		Enables using two prefixes.  Not supported.

COMPOUND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUND*
		This is one line with the count of COMPOUND items, followed by
		that many COMPOUND lines with a pattern.
		Remove the first line with the count and rename the other
		items to COMPOUNDRULE |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDFIRST	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDFIRST*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDBEGIN	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDBEGIN*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDEND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDEND*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDMIDDLE	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDMIDDLE*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDRULES	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDRULES*
		Number of COMPOUNDRULE lines following.  Ignored, but the
		argument must be a number.

COMPOUNDSYLLABLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-COMPOUNDSYLLABLE*
		Use SYLLABLE and COMPOUNDSYLMAX instead. |spell-SYLLABLE|
		|spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX|

KEY		(Hunspell)				*spell-KEY*
		Define characters that are close together on the keyboard.
		Used to give better suggestions.  Not supported.
		
LANG		(Hunspell)				*spell-LANG*
		This specifies language-specific behavior.  This actually
		moves part of the language knowledge into the program,
		therefore Vim does not support it.  Each language property
		must be specified separately.

LEMMA_PRESENT	(Hunspell)				*spell-LEMMA_PRESENT*
		Only needed for morphological analysis.

MAXNGRAMSUGS	(Hunspell)				*spell-MAXNGRAMSUGS*
		Set number of n-gram suggestions.  Not supported.

PSEUDOROOT	(Hunspell)				*spell-PSEUDOROOT*
		Use NEEDAFFIX instead. |spell-NEEDAFFIX|

SUGSWITHDOTS	(Hunspell)				*spell-SUGSWITHDOTS*
		Adds dots to suggestions.  Vim doesn't need this.

SYLLABLENUM	(Hunspell)				*spell-SYLLABLENUM*
		Not supported.

TRY		(Myspell, Hunspell, others)		*spell-TRY*
		Vim does not use the TRY item, it is ignored.  For making
		suggestions the actual characters in the words are used, that
		is much more efficient.

WORDCHARS	(Hunspell)				*spell-WORDCHARS*
		Used to recognize words.  Vim doesn't need it, because there
		is no need to separate words before checking them (using a
		trie instead of a hashtable).

SPONSOR VIM DEVELOPMENT						*sponsor*

Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
working on Vim please send a donation.

Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
in Uganda.  See |uganda|.  But at the same time donations increase Bram's
motivation to keep working on Vim!

For the most recent information about sponsoring look on the Vim web site:

	http://www.vim.org/sponsor/

More explanations can be found in the |sponsor-faq|.


REGISTERED VIM USER						*register*

You can become a registered Vim user by sending at least 10 euro.  This works
similar to sponsoring Vim, see |sponsor| above.  Registration was made
possible for the situation where your boss or bookkeeper may be willing to
register software, but does not like the terms "sponsoring" and "donation".

More explanations can be found in the |register-faq|.


VOTE FOR FEATURES					*vote-for-features*

To give registered Vim users and sponsors an advantage over lurkers they can
vote for the items Bram should work on.  How does this voting work?

1.  You send at least 10 euro.  See below for ways to transfer money
    |send-money|.

2.  You will be e-mailed a registration key.  Enter this key on your account
    page on the Vim website.  You can easily create an account if you don't
    have one yet.

3.  You can enter your votes on the voting page.  There is a link to that page
    on your account page after entering a registration key.  Your votes will
    be counted for two years.

4.  The voting results appear on the results page, which is visible for
    everybody:  http://www.vim.org/sponsor/vote_results.php

Additionally, once you have sent 100 euro or more in total, your name appears
in the "Vim hall of honour":   http://www.vim.org/sponsor/hall_of_honour.php
But only if you enable this on your account page.


HOW TO SEND MONEY						*send-money*

Credit card	Through PayPal, see the PayPal site for information:
			https://www.paypal.com/en_US/mrb/pal=XAC62PML3GF8Q
		The e-mail address for sending sponsorship money is:
			donate@vim.org
		The e-mail address for Vim registration is:
			register@vim.org
		Using Euro is preferred, other currencies are also accepted.
		In Euro countries a bank transfer is preferred, this has lower
		costs.

Other methods	See |iccf-donations|.
		Include "Vim sponsor" or "Vim registration" in the comment of
		your money transfer.  Send me an e-mail that mentions the
		amount you transferred if you want to vote for features and
		show others you are a registered Vim user or sponsor.

Cash		Small amounts can be sent with ordinary mail.  Put something
		around the money, so that it's not noticeable from the
		outside.  Mention your e-mail address if you want to vote for
		features and show others you are a registered Vim user or
		sponsor.

You can use this permanent address:
			Bram Moolenaar
			Finsterruetihof 1
			8134 Adliswil

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS				*sponsor-faq* *register-faq*

Why should I give money?

If you do not show your appreciation for Vim then Bram will be less motivated
to fix bugs and add new features.  He will do something else instead.


How much money should I send?

That is up to you.  The more you give, the more children will be helped.
An indication for individuals that use Vim at home: 10 Euro per year.  For
professional use: 30 Euro per year per person.  Send at least 10 euro to be
able to vote for features.


What do I get in return?

Each registered Vim user and sponsor who donates at least 10 euro will be able
to vote for new features.  These votes will give priority to the work on Vim.
The votes are valid for two years.  The more money you send the more your
votes count |votes-counted|.

If you send 100 Euro or more in total you will be mentioned on the "Vim hall
of honour" page on the Vim web site.  But only if you enable this on your
account page.  You can also select whether the amount will be visible.


How do I become a Vim sponsor or registered Vim user?

Send money, as explained above |send-money| and include your e-mail address.
When the money has been received you will receive a unique registration key.
This key can be used on the Vim website to activate voting on your Vim
account.  You will then get an extra page where you can vote for features and
choose whether others will be able to see that you donated.  There is a link
to this page on your "My Account" page.


What is the difference between sponsoring and registering?

It has a different name.  Use the term "registration" if your boss doesn't
like "sponsoring" or "donation".  The benefits are the same.


How can I send money?

See |send-money|.  Check the web site for the most recent information:
http://www.vim.org/sponsor/


Why don't you use the SourceForge donation system?

SourceForge takes 5% of the donations for themselves.  If you want to support
SourceForge you can send money to them directly.


I cannot afford to send money, may I still use Vim?

Yes.


I did not register Vim, can I use all available features?

Yes.


I noticed a bug, do I need to register before I can report it?

No, suggestions for improving Vim can always be given.  For improvements use
the developer |maillist|, for reporting bugs see |bugs|.


How are my votes counted?				*votes-counted*

You may vote when you send 10 euro or more.  You can enter up to ten votes.
You can select the same item several times to give it more points.  You can
also enter three counter votes, these count as negative points.

When you send 30 euro or more the points are doubled.  Above 100 euro they
count four times, above 300 euro they count six times, above 1000 euro ten
times.


Can I change my votes?

You can change your votes any time you like, up to two years after you
sent money.  The points will be counted right away.


Can I add an item to vote on?

Not directly.  You can suggest items to vote on to Bram.  He will consider
fitting your item into the list.


How about Charityware?

Currently the Vim donations go to |uganda| anyway.  Thus it doesn't matter if
you sponsor Vim or ICCF.  Except that Vim sponsoring will allow you to vote
for features.


I donated $$$, now please add feature XYZ!

There is no direct relation between your donation and the work Bram does.
Otherwise you would be paying for work and we would have to pay tax over the
donation.  If you want to hire Bram for specific work, contact him directly,
don't use the donation system.


Are the donations tax deductible?

That depends on your country.  The donations to help the children in |Uganda|
are tax deductible in Holland, Germany, Canada and in the USA.  See the ICCF
website http://iccf-holland.org/donate.html.  You must send an e-mail to Bram
to let him know that the donation is done because of the use of Vim.


Can you send me a bill?

No, because there is no relation between the money you send and the work that
is done.  But a receipt is possible.

==============================================================================
1. Vim arguments					*vim-arguments*

Most often, Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

	vim filename					*-vim*

More generally, Vim is started with:

	vim [option | filename] ..

Option arguments and file name arguments can be mixed, and any number of them
can be given.  However, watch out for options that take an argument.

For compatibility with various Vi versions, see	|cmdline-arguments|.

Exactly one out of the following five items may be used to choose how to
start editing:

							*-file* *---*
filename	One or more file names.  The first one will be the current
		file and read into the buffer.  The cursor will be positioned
		on the first line of the buffer.
		To avoid a file name starting with a '-' being interpreted as
		an option, precede the arglist with "--", e.g.: >
			vim -- -filename
<		All arguments after the "--" will be interpreted as file names,
		no other options or "+command" argument can follow.

							*--*
-		This argument can mean two things, depending on whether Ex
		mode is to be used.

		Starting in Normal mode: >
			vim -
			ex -v -
<		Start editing a new buffer, which is filled with text
		that is read from stdin.  The commands that would normally be
		read from stdin will now be read from stderr.  Example: >
			find . -name "*.c" -print | vim -
<		The buffer will be marked modified, because it contains text
		that needs to be saved.  Except when in readonly mode, then
		the buffer is not marked modified.  Example: >
			ls | view -
<
		Starting in Ex mode: >
			ex -
			vim -e -
			exim -
			vim -E
<		Start editing in silent mode.  See |-s-ex|.

							*-t* *-tag*
-t {tag}	A tag.  "tag" is looked up in the tags file, the associated
		file becomes the current file, and the associated command is
		executed.  Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case
		"tag" often is a function name.  The effect is that the file
		containing that function becomes the current file and the
		cursor is positioned on the start of the function (see
		|tags|).

							*-q* *-qf*
-q [errorfile]	QuickFix mode.  The file with the name [errorfile] is read
		and the first error is displayed.  See |quickfix|.
		If [errorfile] is not given, the 'errorfile' option is used
		for the file name.  See 'errorfile' for the default value.
		{not in Vi}

(nothing)	Without one of the four items above, Vim will start editing a
		new buffer.  It's empty and doesn't have a file name.


The startup mode can be changed by using another name instead of "vim", which
is equal to giving options:
ex	vim -e	    Start in Ex mode (see |Ex-mode|).		    *ex*
exim	vim -E	    Start in improved Ex mode (see |Ex-mode|).	    *exim*
			(normally not installed)
view	vim -R	    Start in read-only mode (see |-R|).		    *view*
gvim	vim -g	    Start the GUI (see |gui|).			    *gvim*
gex	vim -eg	    Start the GUI in Ex mode.			  *gex*
gview	vim -Rg	    Start the GUI in read-only mode.		  *gview*
rvim	vim -Z	    Like "vim", but in restricted mode (see |-Z|)   *rvim*
rview	vim -RZ	    Like "view", but in restricted mode.	  *rview*
rgvim	vim -gZ	    Like "gvim", but in restricted mode.	  *rgvim*
rgview	vim -RgZ    Like "gview", but in restricted mode.	  *rgview*
evim    vim -y      Easy Vim: set 'insertmode' (see |-y|)	    *evim*
eview   vim -yR     Like "evim" in read-only mode		  *eview*
vimdiff vim -d	    Start in diff mode |diff-mode|
gvimdiff vim -gd    Start in diff mode |diff-mode|

Additional characters may follow, they are ignored.  For example, you can have
"gvim-5" to start the GUI.  You must have an executable by that name then, of
course.

On Unix, you would normally have one executable called Vim, and links from the
different startup-names to that executable.  If your system does not support
links and you do not want to have several copies of the executable, you could
use an alias instead.  For example: >
	alias view   vim -R
	alias gvim   vim -g
<
							*startup-options*
The option arguments may be given in any order.  Single-letter options can be
combined after one dash.  There can be no option arguments after the "--"
argument.

On VMS all option arguments are assumed to be lowercase, unless preceded with
a slash.  Thus "-R" means recovery and "-/R" readonly.

--help							*-h* *--help*
-h		Give usage (help) message and exit.  {not in Vi}
		See |info-message| about capturing the text.

							*--version*
--version	Print version information and exit.  Same output as for
		|:version| command.  {not in Vi}
		See |info-message| about capturing the text.

							*--noplugin*
--noplugin	Skip loading plugins.  Resets the 'loadplugins' option.
		{not in Vi}
		Note that the |-u| argument may also disable loading plugins:
			argument	load vimrc files	load plugins ~
			(nothing)		yes		    yes
			-u NONE			no		    no
			-u NORC			no		    yes
			--noplugin		yes		    no

--startuptime {fname}					*--startuptime*
		During startup write timing messages to the file {fname}.
		This can be used to find out where time is spent while loading
		your .vimrc, plugins and opening the first file.
		When {fname} already exists new messages are appended.
		(Only available when compiled with the |+startuptime|
		feature).

							*--literal*
--literal	Take file names literally, don't expand wildcards.  Not needed
		for Unix, because Vim always takes file names literally (the
		shell expands wildcards).
		Applies to all the names, also the ones that come before this
		argument.

							*-+*
+[num]		The cursor will be positioned on line "num" for the first
		file being edited.  If "num" is missing, the cursor will be
		positioned on the last line.

							*-+/*
+/{pat}		The cursor will be positioned on the first line containing
		"pat" in the first file being edited (see |pattern| for the
		available search patterns).  The search starts at the cursor
		position, which can be the first line or the cursor position
		last used from |viminfo|. To force a search from the first
		line use "+1 +/pat".

+{command}						*-+c* *-c*
-c {command}	{command} will be executed after the first file has been
		read (and after autocommands and modelines for that file have
		been processed).  "command" is interpreted as an Ex command.
		If the "command" contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
		double quotes (this depends on the shell that is used).
		Example: >
			vim  "+set si"  main.c
			vim  "+find stdio.h"
			vim  -c "set ff=dos"  -c wq  mine.mak
<
		Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "-c" arguments in a Vim
		command.  They are executed in the order given.  A "-S"
		argument counts as a "-c" argument as well.
		{Vi only allows one command}

--cmd {command}						*--cmd*
		{command} will be executed before processing any vimrc file.
		Otherwise it acts like -c {command}.  You can use up to 10 of
		these commands, independently from "-c" commands.
		{not in Vi}

							*-S*
-S {file}	The {file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.
		This is an easy way to do the equivalent of: >
			-c "source {file}"
<		It can be mixed with "-c" arguments and repeated like "-c".
		The limit of 10 "-c" arguments applies here as well.
		{file} cannot start with a "-".
		{not in Vi}

-S		Works like "-S Session.vim".  Only when used as the last
		argument or when another "-" option follows.

							*-r*
-r		Recovery mode.  Without a file name argument, a list of
		existing swap files is given.  With a file name, a swap file
		is read to recover a crashed editing session.  See
		|crash-recovery|.

							*-L*
-L		Same as -r.  {only in some versions of Vi: "List recoverable
		edit sessions"}

							*-R*
-R		Readonly mode.  The 'readonly' option will be set for all the
		files being edited.  You can still edit the buffer, but will
		be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file.  If you
		forgot that you are in View mode and did make some changes,
		you can overwrite a file by adding an exclamation mark to
		the Ex command, as in ":w!".  The 'readonly' option can be
		reset with ":set noro" (see the options chapter, |options|).
		Subsequent edits will not be done in readonly mode.  Calling
		the executable "view" has the same effect as the -R argument.
		The 'updatecount' option will be set to 10000, meaning that
		the swap file will not be updated automatically very often.

							*-m*
-m		Modifications not allowed to be written.  The 'write' option
		will be reset, so that writing files is disabled.  However,
		the 'write' option can be set to enable writing again.
		{not in Vi}

							*-M*
-M		Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' option will be
		reset, so that changes are not allowed.  The 'write' option
		will be reset, so that writing files is disabled.  However,
		the 'modifiable' and 'write' options can be set to enable
		changes and writing.
		{not in Vi}

						*-Z* *restricted-mode* *E145*
-Z		Restricted mode.  All commands that make use of an external
		shell are disabled.  This includes suspending with CTRL-Z,
		":sh", filtering, the system() function, backtick expansion,
		delete(), rename(), mkdir(), writefile(), libcall(), etc.
		{not in Vi}

							*-g*
-g		Start Vim in GUI mode.  See |gui|. For the opposite see |-v|.
		{not in Vi}

							*-v*
-v		Start Ex in Vi mode.  Only makes a difference when the
		executable is called "ex" or "gvim".  For gvim the GUI is not
		started if possible.

							*-e*
-e		Start Vim in Ex mode |Q|.  Only makes a difference when the
		executable is not called "ex".

							*-E*
-E		Start Vim in improved Ex mode |gQ|.  Only makes a difference
		when the executable is not called "exim".
		{not in Vi}

							*-s-ex*
-s		Silent or batch mode.  Only when Vim was started as "ex" or
		when preceded with the "-e" argument.  Otherwise see |-s|,
		which does take an argument while this use of "-s" doesn't.
		To be used when Vim is used to execute Ex commands from a file
		instead of a terminal.  Switches off most prompts and
		informative messages.  Also warnings and error messages.
		The output of these commands is displayed (to stdout):
			:print
			:list
			:number
			:set      to display option values.
		When 'verbose' is non-zero messages are printed (for
		debugging, to stderr).
		'term' and $TERM are not used.
		If Vim appears to be stuck try typing "qa!<Enter>".  You don't
		get a prompt thus you can't see Vim is waiting for you to type
		something.
		Initializations are skipped (except the ones given with the
		"-u" argument).
		Example: >
			vim -e -s  < thefilter  thefile
<
							*-b*
-b		Binary mode.  File I/O will only recognize <NL> to separate
		lines.  The 'expandtab' option will be reset.  The 'textwidth'
		option is set to 0.  'modeline' is reset.  The 'binary' option
		is set.  This is done after reading the vimrc/exrc files but
		before reading any file in the arglist.  See also
		|edit-binary|.  {not in Vi}

							*-l*
-l		Lisp mode.  Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.

							*-A*
-A		Arabic mode.  Sets the 'arabic' option on.  (Only when
		compiled with the |+arabic| features (which include
		|+rightleft|), otherwise Vim gives an error message
		and exits.)  {not in Vi}

							*-F*
-F		Farsi mode.  Sets the 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' options on.
		(Only when compiled with |+rightleft| and |+farsi| features,
		otherwise Vim gives an error message and exits.)  {not in Vi}

							*-H*
-H		Hebrew mode.  Sets the 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' options on.
		(Only when compiled with the |+rightleft| feature, otherwise
		Vim gives an error message and exits.)  {not in Vi}

							*-V* *verbose*
-V[N]		Verbose.  Sets the 'verbose' option to [N] (default: 10).
		Messages will be given for each file that is ":source"d and
		for reading or writing a viminfo file.  Can be used to find
		out what is happening upon startup and exit.  {not in Vi}
		Example: >
			vim -V8 foobar

-V[N]{filename}
		Like -V and set 'verbosefile' to {filename}.  The result is
		that messages are not displayed but written to the file
		{filename}.  {filename} must not start with a digit.
		Example: >
			vim -V20vimlog foobar
<
							*-D*
-D		Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first
		command from a script. |debug-mode|
		{not available when compiled without the |+eval| feature}
		{not in Vi}

							*-C*
-C		Compatible mode.  Sets the 'compatible' option.  You can use
		this to get 'compatible', even though a .vimrc file exists.
		Keep in mind that the command ":set nocompatible" in some
		plugin or startup script overrules this, so you may end up
		with 'nocompatible' anyway.  To find out, use: >
			:verbose set compatible?
<		Several plugins won't work with 'compatible' set.  You may
		want to set it after startup this way: >
			vim "+set cp" filename
<		Also see |compatible-default|.  {not in Vi}

							*-N*
-N		Not compatible mode.  Resets the 'compatible' option.  You can
		use this to get 'nocompatible', when there is no .vimrc file
		or when using "-u NONE".
		Also see |compatible-default|.  {not in Vi}

							*-y* *easy*
-y		Easy mode.  Implied for |evim| and |eview|.  Starts with
		'insertmode' set and behaves like a click-and-type editor.
		This sources the script $VIMRUNTIME/evim.vim.  Mappings are
		set up to work like most click-and-type editors, see
		|evim-keys|.  The GUI is started when available.
		{not in Vi}

							*-n*
-n		No swap file will be used.  Recovery after a crash will be
		impossible.  Handy if you want to view or edit a file on a
		very slow medium (e.g., a floppy).
		Can also be done with ":set updatecount=0".  You can switch it
		on again by setting the 'updatecount' option to some value,
		e.g., ":set uc=100".
		NOTE: Don't combine -n with -b, making -nb, because that has a
		different meaning: |-nb|.
		'updatecount' is set to 0 AFTER executing commands from a
		vimrc file, but before the GUI initializations.  Thus it
		overrides a setting for 'updatecount' in a vimrc file, but not
		in a gvimrc file.  See |startup|.
		When you want to reduce accesses to the disk (e.g., for a
		laptop), don't use "-n", but set 'updatetime' and
		'updatecount' to very big numbers, and type ":preserve" when
		you want to save your work.  This way you keep the possibility
		for crash recovery.
		{not in Vi}

							*-o*
-o[N]		Open N windows, split horizontally.  If [N] is not given,
		one window is opened for every file given as argument.  If
		there is not enough room, only the first few files get a
		window.  If there are more windows than arguments, the last
		few windows will be editing an empty file.
		{not in Vi}

							*-O*
-O[N]		Open N windows, split vertically.  Otherwise it's like -o.
		If both the -o and the -O option are given, the last one on
		the command line determines how the windows will be split.
		{not in Vi}

							*-p*
-p[N]		Open N tab pages.  If [N] is not given, one tab page is opened
		for every file given as argument.  The maximum is set with
		'tabpagemax' pages (default 10).  If there are more tab pages
		than arguments, the last few tab pages will be editing an
		empty file.  Also see |tabpage|.
		{not in Vi}

							*-T*
-T {terminal}	Set the terminal type to "terminal".  This influences the
		codes that Vim will send to your terminal.  This is normally
		not needed, because Vim will be able to find out what type
		of terminal you are using.  (See |terminal-info|.)  {not in Vi}

							*-d*
-d		Start in diff mode, like |vimdiff|.
		{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the |+diff|
		feature}

-d {device}	Only on the Amiga and when not compiled with the |+diff|
		feature.  Works like "-dev".
							*-dev*
-dev {device}	Only on the Amiga: The {device} is opened to be used for
		editing.
		Normally you would use this to set the window position and
		size: "-d con:x/y/width/height", e.g.,
		"-d con:30/10/600/150".  But you can also use it to start
		editing on another device, e.g., AUX:.  {not in Vi}
							*-f*
-f		GUI: Do not disconnect from the program that started Vim.
		'f' stands for "foreground".  If omitted, the GUI forks a new
		process and exits the current one.  "-f" should be used when
		gvim is started by a program that will wait for the edit
		session to finish (e.g., mail or readnews).  If you want gvim
		never to fork, include 'f' in 'guioptions' in your |gvimrc|.
		Careful: You can use "-gf" to start the GUI in the foreground,
		but "-fg" is used to specify the foreground color.  |gui-fork|

		Amiga: Do not restart Vim to open a new window.  This
		option should be used when Vim is started by a program that
		will wait for the edit session to finish (e.g., mail or
		readnews).  See |amiga-window|.

		MS-Windows: This option is not supported.  However, when
		running Vim with an installed vim.bat or gvim.bat file it
		works.
		{not in Vi}


							*--nofork*
--nofork	GUI: Do not fork.  Same as |-f|.
							*-u* *E282*
-u {vimrc}	The file {vimrc} is read for initializations.  Most other
		initializations are skipped; see |initialization|.  This can
		be used to start Vim in a special mode, with special
		mappings and settings.  A shell alias can be used to make
		this easy to use.  For example: >
			alias vimc vim -u ~/.c_vimrc !*
<		Also consider using autocommands; see |autocommand|.
		When {vimrc} is equal to "NONE" (all uppercase), all
		initializations from files and environment variables are
		skipped, including reading the |gvimrc| file when the GUI
		starts.  Loading plugins is also skipped.
		When {vimrc} is equal to "NORC" (all uppercase), this has the
		same effect as "NONE", but loading plugins is not skipped.
		Using the "-u" argument has the side effect that the
		'compatible' option will be on by default.  This can have
		unexpected effects.  See |'compatible'|.
		{not in Vi}

							*-U* *E230*
-U {gvimrc}	The file {gvimrc} is read for initializations when the GUI
		starts.  Other GUI initializations are skipped.  When {gvimrc}
		is equal to "NONE", no file is read for GUI initializations at
		all.  |gui-init|
		Exception: Reading the system-wide menu file is always done.
		{not in Vi}

							*-i*
-i {viminfo}	The file "viminfo" is used instead of the default viminfo
		file.  If the name "NONE" is used (all uppercase), no viminfo
		file is read or written, even if 'viminfo' is set or when
		":rv" or ":wv" are used.  See also |viminfo-file|.
		{not in Vi}

							*-x*
-x		Use encryption to read/write files.  Will prompt for a key,
		which is then stored in the 'key' option.  All writes will
		then use this key to encrypt the text.  The '-x' argument is
		not needed when reading a file, because there is a check if
		the file that is being read has been encrypted, and Vim asks
		for a key automatically. |encryption|

							*-X*
-X		Do not try connecting to the X server to get the current
		window title and copy/paste using the X clipboard.  This
		avoids a long startup time when running Vim in a terminal
		emulator and the connection to the X server is slow.
		See |--startuptime| to find out if affects you.
		Only makes a difference on Unix or VMS, when compiled with the
		|+X11| feature.  Otherwise it's ignored.
		To disable the connection only for specific terminals, see the
		'clipboard' option.
		When the X11 Session Management Protocol (XSMP) handler has
		been built in, the -X option also disables that connection as
		it, too, may have undesirable delays.
		When the connection is desired later anyway (e.g., for
		client-server messages), call the |serverlist()| function.
		This does not enable the XSMP handler though.
		{not in Vi}

							*-s*
-s {scriptin}	The script file "scriptin" is read.  The characters in the
		file are interpreted as if you had typed them.  The same can
		be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".  If the end
		of the file is reached before the editor exits, further
		characters are read from the keyboard.  Only works when not
		started in Ex mode, see |-s-ex|.  See also |complex-repeat|.
		{not in Vi}

							*-w_nr*
-w {number}
-w{number}	Set the 'window' option to {number}.

							*-w*
-w {scriptout}	All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
		"scriptout", until you exit Vim.  This is useful if you want
		to create a script file to be used with "vim -s" or
		":source!".  When the "scriptout" file already exists, new
		characters are appended.  See also |complex-repeat|.
		{scriptout} cannot start with a digit.
		{not in Vi}

							*-W*
-W {scriptout}	Like -w, but do not append, overwrite an existing file.
		{not in Vi}

--remote [+{cmd}] {file} ...
		Open the {file} in another Vim that functions as a server.
		Any non-file arguments must come before this.
		See |--remote|. {not in Vi}

--remote-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...
		Like --remote, but don't complain if there is no server.
		See |--remote-silent|. {not in Vi}

--remote-wait [+{cmd}] {file} ...
		Like --remote, but wait for the server to finish editing the
		file(s).
		See |--remote-wait|. {not in Vi}

--remote-wait-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...
		Like --remote-wait, but don't complain if there is no server.
		See |--remote-wait-silent|. {not in Vi}

--servername {name}
		Specify the name of the Vim server to send to or to become.
		See |--servername|. {not in Vi}

--remote-send {keys}
		Send {keys} to a Vim server and exit.
		See |--remote-send|. {not in Vi}

--remote-expr {expr}
		Evaluate {expr} in another Vim that functions as a server.
		The result is printed on stdout.
		See |--remote-expr|. {not in Vi}

--serverlist	Output a list of Vim server names and exit.  See
		|--serverlist|. {not in Vi}

--socketid {id}						*--socketid*
		GTK+ GUI Vim only.  Make gvim try to use GtkPlug mechanism, so
		that it runs inside another window.  See |gui-gtk-socketid|
		for details. {not in Vi}

--windowid {id}						*--windowid*
		Win32 GUI Vim only.  Make gvim try to use the window {id} as a
		parent, so that it runs inside that window.  See
		|gui-w32-windowid| for details. {not in Vi}

--echo-wid						*--echo-wid*
		GTK+ GUI Vim only.  Make gvim echo the Window ID on stdout,
		which can be used to run gvim in a kpart widget.  The format
		of the output is: >
			WID: 12345\n
<		{not in Vi}

--role {role}						*--role*
		GTK+ 2 GUI only.  Set the role of the main window to {role}.
		The window role can be used by a window manager to uniquely
		identify a window, in order to restore window placement and
		such.  The --role argument is passed automatically when
		restoring the session on login.  See |gui-gnome-session|
		{not in Vi}

-P {parent-title}				*-P* *MDI* *E671* *E672*
		Win32 only: Specify the title of the parent application.  When
		possible, Vim will run in an MDI window inside the
		application.
		{parent-title} must appear in the window title of the parent
		application.  Make sure that it is specific enough.
		Note that the implementation is still primitive.  It won't
		work with all applications and the menu doesn't work.

-nb							*-nb*
-nb={fname}
-nb:{hostname}:{addr}:{password}
		Attempt connecting to Netbeans and become an editor server for
		it.  The second form specifies a file to read connection info
		from.  The third form specifies the hostname, address and
		password for connecting to Netbeans. |netbeans-run|
		{only available when compiled with the |+netbeans_intg|
		feature; if not then -nb will make Vim exit}

If the executable is called "view", Vim will start in Readonly mode.  This is
useful if you can make a hard or symbolic link from "view" to "vim".
Starting in Readonly mode can also be done with "vim -R".

If the executable is called "ex", Vim will start in "Ex" mode.  This means it
will accept only ":" commands.  But when the "-v" argument is given, Vim will
start in Normal mode anyway.

Additional arguments are available on unix like systems when compiled with
X11 GUI support.  See |gui-resources|.

==============================================================================
2. Vim on the Amiga					*starting-amiga*

Starting Vim from the Workbench				*workbench*
-------------------------------

Vim can be started from the Workbench by clicking on its icon twice.  It will
then start with an empty buffer.

Vim can be started to edit one or more files by using a "Project" icon.  The
"Default Tool" of the icon must be the full pathname of the Vim executable.
The name of the ".info" file must be the same as the name of the text file.
By clicking on this icon twice, Vim will be started with the file name as
current file name, which will be read into the buffer (if it exists).  You can
edit multiple files by pressing the shift key while clicking on icons, and
clicking twice on the last one.  The "Default Tool" for all these icons must
be the same.

It is not possible to give arguments to Vim, other than file names, from the
workbench.

Vim window						*amiga-window*
----------

Vim will run in the CLI window where it was started.  If Vim was started with
the "run" or "runback" command, or if Vim was started from the workbench, it
will open a window of its own.

Technical detail:
	To open the new window a little trick is used.  As soon as Vim
	recognizes that it does not run in a normal CLI window, it will
	create a script file in "t:".  This script file contains the same
	command as the one Vim was started with, and an "endcli" command.
	This script file is then executed with a "newcli" command (the "c:run"
	and "c:newcli" commands are required for this to work).  The script
	file will hang around until reboot, or until you delete it.  This
	method is required to get the ":sh" and ":!" commands to work
	correctly.  But when Vim was started with the -f option (foreground
	mode), this method is not used.  The reason for this is that
	when a program starts Vim with the -f option it will wait for Vim to
	exit.  With the script trick, the calling program does not know when
	Vim exits.  The -f option can be used when Vim is started by a mail
	program which also waits for the edit session to finish.  As a
	consequence, the ":sh" and ":!" commands are not available when the
	-f option is used.

Vim will automatically recognize the window size and react to window
resizing.  Under Amiga DOS 1.3, it is advised to use the fastfonts program,
"FF", to speed up display redrawing.

==============================================================================
3. Running eVim							*evim-keys*

EVim runs Vim as click-and-type editor.  This is very unlike the original Vi
idea.  But it helps for people that don't use Vim often enough to learn the
commands.  Hopefully they will find out that learning to use Normal mode
commands will make their editing much more effective.

In Evim these options are changed from their default value:

	:set nocompatible	Use Vim improvements
	:set insertmode		Remain in Insert mode most of the time
	:set hidden		Keep invisible buffers loaded
	:set backup		Keep backup files (not for VMS)
	:set backspace=2	Backspace over everything
	:set autoindent		auto-indent new lines
	:set history=50		keep 50 lines of Ex commands
	:set ruler		show the cursor position
	:set incsearch		show matches halfway typing a pattern
	:set mouse=a		use the mouse in all modes
	:set hlsearch		highlight all matches for a search pattern
	:set whichwrap+=<,>,[,]  <Left> and <Right> wrap around line breaks
	:set guioptions-=a	non-Unix only: don't do auto-select

Key mappings:
	<Down>		moves by screen lines rather than file lines
	<Up>		idem
	Q		does "gq", formatting, instead of Ex mode
	<BS>		in Visual mode: deletes the selection
	CTRL-X		in Visual mode: Cut to clipboard
	<S-Del>		idem
	CTRL-C		in Visual mode: Copy to clipboard
	<C-Insert>	idem
	CTRL-V		Pastes from the clipboard (in any mode)
	<S-Insert>	idem
	CTRL-Q		do what CTRL-V used to do
	CTRL-Z		undo
	CTRL-Y		redo
	<M-Space>	system menu
	CTRL-A		select all
	<C-Tab>		next window, CTRL-W w
	<C-F4>		close window, CTRL-W c

Additionally:
- ":behave mswin" is used |:behave|
- syntax highlighting is enabled
- filetype detection is enabled, filetype plugins and indenting is enabled
- in a text file 'textwidth' is set to 78

One hint: If you want to go to Normal mode to be able to type a sequence of
commands, use CTRL-L. |i_CTRL-L|

==============================================================================
4. Initialization				*initialization* *startup*

This section is about the non-GUI version of Vim.  See |gui-fork| for
additional initialization when starting the GUI.

At startup, Vim checks environment variables and files and sets values
accordingly.  Vim proceeds in this order:

1. Set the 'shell' and 'term' option		*SHELL* *COMSPEC* *TERM*
	The environment variable SHELL, if it exists, is used to set the
	'shell' option.  On MS-DOS and Win32, the COMSPEC variable is used
	if SHELL is not set.
	The environment variable TERM, if it exists, is used to set the 'term'
	option.  However, 'term' will change later when starting the GUI (step
	8 below).

2. Process the arguments
	The options and file names from the command that start Vim are
	inspected.  Buffers are created for all files (but not loaded yet).
	The |-V| argument can be used to display or log what happens next,
	useful for debugging the initializations.

3. Execute Ex commands, from environment variables and/or files
	An environment variable is read as one Ex command line, where multiple
	commands must be separated with '|' or "<NL>".
								*vimrc* *exrc*
	A file that contains initialization commands is called a "vimrc" file.
	Each line in a vimrc file is executed as an Ex command line.  It is
	sometimes also referred to as "exrc" file.  They are the same type of
	file, but "exrc" is what Vi always used, "vimrc" is a Vim specific
	name.  Also see |vimrc-intro|.

	Places for your personal initializations:
		Unix		$HOME/.vimrc or $HOME/.vim/vimrc
		OS/2		$HOME/.vimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc
				or $VIM/.vimrc (or _vimrc)
		MS-Windows	$HOME/_vimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc
				or $VIM/_vimrc
		Amiga		s:.vimrc, home:.vimrc, home:vimfiles:vimrc
				or $VIM/.vimrc

	The files are searched in the order specified above and only the first
	one that is found is read.

	RECOMMENDATION: Put all your Vim configuration stuff in the
	$HOME/.vim/ directory ($HOME/vimfiles/ for MS-Windows). That makes it
	easy to copy it to another system.

	If Vim was started with "-u filename", the file "filename" is used.
	All following initializations until 4. are skipped. $MYVIMRC is not
	set.
	"vim -u NORC" can be used to skip these initializations without
	reading a file.  "vim -u NONE" also skips loading plugins.  |-u|

	If Vim was started in Ex mode with the "-s" argument, all following
	initializations until 4. are skipped.  Only the "-u" option is
	interpreted.
							*evim.vim*
     a. If vim was started as |evim| or |eview| or with the |-y| argument, the
	script $VIMRUNTIME/evim.vim will be loaded.
							*system-vimrc*
     b. For Unix, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, OS/2, VMS, Macintosh, RISC-OS and Amiga
	the system vimrc file is read for initializations.  The path of this
	file is shown with the ":version" command.  Mostly it's "$VIM/vimrc".
	Note that this file is ALWAYS read in 'compatible' mode, since the
	automatic resetting of 'compatible' is only done later.  Add a ":set
	nocp" command if you like.
	For the Macintosh the $VIMRUNTIME/macmap.vim is read.

	  *VIMINIT* *.vimrc* *_vimrc* *EXINIT* *.exrc* *_exrc* *$MYVIMRC*
     c. Four places are searched for initializations.  The first that exists
	is used, the others are ignored.  The $MYVIMRC environment variable is
	set to the file that was first found, unless $MYVIMRC was already set
	and when using VIMINIT.
	-  The environment variable VIMINIT (see also |compatible-default|) (*)
	   The value of $VIMINIT is used as an Ex command line.
	-  The user vimrc file(s):
		    "$HOME/.vimrc"	   (for Unix and OS/2) (*)
		    "$HOME/.vim/vimrc"	   (for Unix and OS/2) (*)
		    "s:.vimrc"		   (for Amiga) (*)
		    "home:.vimrc"	   (for Amiga) (*)
		    "home:vimfiles:vimrc"  (for Amiga) (*)
		    "$VIM/.vimrc"	   (for OS/2 and Amiga) (*)
		    "$HOME/_vimrc"	   (for MS-DOS and Win32) (*)
		    "$HOME/vimfiles/vimrc" (for MS-DOS and Win32) (*)
		    "$VIM/_vimrc"	   (for MS-DOS and Win32) (*)
		Note: For Unix, OS/2 and Amiga, when ".vimrc" does not exist,
		"_vimrc" is also tried, in case an MS-DOS compatible file
		system is used.  For MS-DOS and Win32 ".vimrc" is checked
		after "_vimrc", in case long file names are used.
		Note: For MS-DOS and Win32, "$HOME" is checked first.  If no
		"_vimrc" or ".vimrc" is found there, "$VIM" is tried.
		See |$VIM| for when $VIM is not set.
	-  The environment variable EXINIT.
	   The value of $EXINIT is used as an Ex command line.
	-  The user exrc file(s).  Same as for the user vimrc file, but with
	   "vimrc" replaced by "exrc".  But only one of ".exrc" and "_exrc" is
	   used, depending on the system.  And without the (*)!

     d. If the 'exrc' option is on (which is not the default), the current
	directory is searched for three files.  The first that exists is used,
	the others are ignored.
	-  The file ".vimrc" (for Unix, Amiga and OS/2) (*)
		    "_vimrc" (for MS-DOS and Win32) (*)
	-  The file "_vimrc" (for Unix, Amiga and OS/2) (*)
		    ".vimrc" (for MS-DOS and Win32) (*)
	-  The file ".exrc"  (for Unix, Amiga and OS/2)
		    "_exrc"  (for MS-DOS and Win32)

     (*) Using this file or environment variable will cause 'compatible' to be
	 off by default.  See |compatible-default|.

4. Load the plugin scripts.					*load-plugins*
	This does the same as the command: >
		:runtime! plugin/**/*.vim
<	The result is that all directories in the 'runtimepath' option will be
	searched for the "plugin" sub-directory and all files ending in ".vim"
	will be sourced (in alphabetical order per directory), also in
	subdirectories.
	Loading plugins won't be done when:
	- The 'loadplugins' option was reset in a vimrc file.
	- The |--noplugin| command line argument is used.
	- The "-u NONE" command line argument is used |-u|.
	- When Vim was compiled without the |+eval| feature.
	Note that using "-c 'set noloadplugins'" doesn't work, because the
	commands from the command line have not been executed yet.  You can
	use "--cmd 'set noloadplugins'" |--cmd|.

5. Set 'shellpipe' and 'shellredir'
	The 'shellpipe' and 'shellredir' options are set according to the
	value of the 'shell' option, unless they have been set before.
	This means that Vim will figure out the values of 'shellpipe' and
	'shellredir' for you, unless you have set them yourself.

6. Set 'updatecount' to zero, if "-n" command argument used

7. Set binary options
	If the "-b" flag was given to Vim, the options for binary editing will
	be set now.  See |-b|.

8. Perform GUI initializations
	Only when starting "gvim", the GUI initializations will be done.  See
	|gui-init|.

9. Read the viminfo file
	If the 'viminfo' option is not empty, the viminfo file is read.  See
	|viminfo-file|.

10. Read the quickfix file
	If the "-q" flag was given to Vim, the quickfix file is read.  If this
	fails, Vim exits.

11. Open all windows
	When the |-o| flag was given, windows will be opened (but not
	displayed yet).
	When the |-p| flag was given, tab pages will be created (but not
	displayed yet).
	When switching screens, it happens now.  Redrawing starts.
	If the "-q" flag was given to Vim, the first error is jumped to.
	Buffers for all windows will be loaded.

12. Execute startup commands
	If a "-t" flag was given to Vim, the tag is jumped to.
	The commands given with the |-c| and |+cmd| arguments are executed.
	The starting flag is reset, has("vim_starting") will now return zero.
	If the 'insertmode' option is set, Insert mode is entered.
	The |VimEnter| autocommands are executed.

Some hints on using initializations:

Standard setup:
Create a vimrc file to set the default settings and mappings for all your edit
sessions.  Put it in a place so that it will be found by 3b:
	~/.vimrc	(Unix and OS/2)
	s:.vimrc	(Amiga)
	$VIM\_vimrc	(MS-DOS and Win32)
Note that creating a vimrc file will cause the 'compatible' option to be off
by default.  See |compatible-default|.

Local setup:
Put all commands that you need for editing a specific directory only into a
vimrc file and place it in that directory under the name ".vimrc" ("_vimrc"
for MS-DOS and Win32).  NOTE: To make Vim look for these special files you
have to turn on the option 'exrc'.  See |trojan-horse| too.

System setup:
This only applies if you are managing a Unix system with several users and
want to set the defaults for all users.  Create a vimrc file with commands
for default settings and mappings and put it in the place that is given with
the ":version" command.

Saving the current state of Vim to a file:
Whenever you have changed values of options or when you have created a
mapping, then you may want to save them in a vimrc file for later use.  See
|save-settings| about saving the current state of settings to a file.

Avoiding setup problems for Vi users:
Vi uses the variable EXINIT and the file "~/.exrc".  So if you do not want to
interfere with Vi, then use the variable VIMINIT and the file "vimrc" instead.

Amiga environment variables:
On the Amiga, two types of environment variables exist.  The ones set with the
DOS 1.3 (or later) setenv command are recognized.  See the AmigaDos 1.3
manual.  The environment variables set with the old Manx Set command (before
version 5.0) are not recognized.

MS-DOS line separators:
On MS-DOS-like systems (MS-DOS itself, Win32, and OS/2), Vim assumes that all
the vimrc files have <CR> <NL> pairs as line separators.  This will give
problems if you have a file with only <NL>s and have a line like
":map xx yy^M".  The trailing ^M will be ignored.

						     *compatible-default*
When Vim starts, the 'compatible' option is on.  This will be used when Vim
starts its initializations.  But as soon as a user vimrc file is found, or a
vimrc file in the current directory, or the "VIMINIT" environment variable is
set, it will be set to 'nocompatible'.  This has the side effect of setting or
resetting other options (see 'compatible').  But only the options that have
not been set or reset will be changed.  This has the same effect like the
value of 'compatible' had this value when starting Vim.  Note that this
doesn't happen for the system-wide vimrc file nor when Vim was started with
the |-u| command line argument.  It does also happen for gvimrc files.  The
$MYVIMRC or $MYGVIMRC file will be set to the first found vimrc and/or gvimrc
file.

But there is a side effect of setting or resetting 'compatible' at the moment
a .vimrc file is found: Mappings are interpreted the moment they are
encountered.  This makes a difference when using things like "<CR>".  If the
mappings depend on a certain value of 'compatible', set or reset it before
giving the mapping.

The above behavior can be overridden in these ways:
- If the "-N" command line argument is given, 'nocompatible' will be used,
  even when no vimrc file exists.
- If the "-C" command line argument is given, 'compatible' will be used, even
  when a vimrc file exists.
- If the "-u {vimrc}" argument is used, 'compatible' will be used.
- When the name of the executable ends in "ex", then this works like the "-C"
  argument was given: 'compatible' will be used, even when a vimrc file
  exists.  This has been done to make Vim behave like "ex", when it is started
  as "ex".

Avoiding trojan horses:					*trojan-horse*
While reading the "vimrc" or the "exrc" file in the current directory, some
commands can be disabled for security reasons by setting the 'secure' option.
This is always done when executing the command from a tags file.  Otherwise it
would be possible that you accidentally use a vimrc or tags file that somebody
else created and contains nasty commands.  The disabled commands are the ones
that start a shell, the ones that write to a file, and ":autocmd".  The ":map"
commands are echoed, so you can see which keys are being mapped.
	If you want Vim to execute all commands in a local vimrc file, you
can reset the 'secure' option in the EXINIT or VIMINIT environment variable or
in the global "exrc" or "vimrc" file.  This is not possible in "vimrc" or
"exrc" in the current directory, for obvious reasons.
	On Unix systems, this only happens if you are not the owner of the
vimrc file.  Warning: If you unpack an archive that contains a vimrc or exrc
file, it will be owned by you.  You won't have the security protection.  Check
the vimrc file before you start Vim in that directory, or reset the 'exrc'
option.  Some Unix systems allow a user to do "chown" on a file.  This makes
it possible for another user to create a nasty vimrc and make you the owner.
Be careful!
	When using tag search commands, executing the search command (the last
part of the line in the tags file) is always done in secure mode.  This works
just like executing a command from a vimrc/exrc in the current directory.

							*slow-start*
If Vim takes a long time to start up, use the |--startuptime| argument to find
out what happens.  There are a few common causes:
- If the Unix version was compiled with the GUI and/or X11 (check the output
  of ":version" for "+GUI" and "+X11"), it may need to load shared libraries
  and connect to the X11 server.  Try compiling a version with GUI and X11
  disabled.  This also should make the executable smaller.
  Use the |-X| command line argument to avoid connecting to the X server when
  running in a terminal.
- If you have "viminfo" enabled, the loading of the viminfo file may take a
  while.  You can find out if this is the problem by disabling viminfo for a
  moment (use the Vim argument "-i NONE", |-i|).  Try reducing the number of
  lines stored in a register with ":set viminfo='20,<50,s10".  |viminfo-file|.

							*:intro*
When Vim starts without a file name, an introductory message is displayed (for
those who don't know what Vim is).  It is removed as soon as the display is
redrawn in any way.  To see the message again, use the ":intro" command (if
there is not enough room, you will see only part of it).
   To avoid the intro message on startup, add the 'I' flag to 'shortmess'.

							*info-message*
The |--help| and |--version| arguments cause Vim to print a message and then
exit.  Normally the message is sent to stdout, thus can be redirected to a
file with: >

	vim --help >file

From inside Vim: >

	:read !vim --help

When using gvim, it detects that it might have been started from the desktop,
without a terminal to show messages on.  This is detected when both stdout and
stderr are not a tty.  This breaks the ":read" command, as used in the example
above.  To make it work again, set 'shellredir' to ">" instead of the default
">&": >

	:set shellredir=>
	:read !gvim --help

This still won't work for systems where gvim does not use stdout at all
though.

==============================================================================
5. $VIM and $VIMRUNTIME
								*$VIM*
The environment variable "$VIM" is used to locate various user files for Vim,
such as the user startup script ".vimrc".  This depends on the system, see
|startup|.

To avoid the need for every user to set the $VIM environment variable, Vim
will try to get the value for $VIM in this order:
1. The value defined by the $VIM environment variable.  You can use this to
   make Vim look in a specific directory for its support files.  Example: >
	setenv VIM /home/paul/vim
2. The path from 'helpfile' is used, unless it contains some environment
   variable too (the default is "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt": chicken-egg
   problem).  The file name ("help.txt" or any other) is removed.  Then
   trailing directory names are removed, in this order: "doc", "runtime" and
   "vim{version}" (e.g., "vim54").
3. For MSDOS, Win32 and OS/2 Vim tries to use the directory name of the
   executable.  If it ends in "/src", this is removed.  This is useful if you
   unpacked the .zip file in some directory, and adjusted the search path to
   find the vim executable.  Trailing directory names are removed, in this
   order: "runtime" and "vim{version}" (e.g., "vim54").
4. For Unix the compile-time defined installation directory is used (see the
   output of ":version").

Once Vim has done this once, it will set the $VIM environment variable.  To
change it later, use a ":let" command like this: >
	:let $VIM = "/home/paul/vim/"
<
								*$VIMRUNTIME*
The environment variable "$VIMRUNTIME" is used to locate various support
files, such as the on-line documentation and files used for syntax
highlighting.  For example, the main help file is normally
"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".
You don't normally set $VIMRUNTIME yourself, but let Vim figure it out.  This
is the order used to find the value of $VIMRUNTIME:
1. If the environment variable $VIMRUNTIME is set, it is used.  You can use
   this when the runtime files are in an unusual location.
2. If "$VIM/vim{version}" exists, it is used.  {version} is the version
   number of Vim, without any '-' or '.'.  For example: "$VIM/vim54".  This is
   the normal value for $VIMRUNTIME.
3. If "$VIM/runtime" exists, it is used.
4. The value of $VIM is used.  This is for backwards compatibility with older
   versions.
5. When the 'helpfile' option is set and doesn't contain a '$', its value is
   used, with "doc/help.txt" removed from the end.

For Unix, when there is a compiled-in default for $VIMRUNTIME (check the
output of ":version"), steps 2, 3 and 4 are skipped, and the compiled-in
default is used after step 5.  This means that the compiled-in default
overrules the value of $VIM.  This is useful if $VIM is "/etc" and the runtime
files are in "/usr/share/vim/vim54".

Once Vim has done this once, it will set the $VIMRUNTIME environment variable.
To change it later, use a ":let" command like this: >
	:let $VIMRUNTIME = "/home/piet/vim/vim54"

In case you need the value of $VIMRUNTIME in a shell (e.g., for a script that
greps in the help files) you might be able to use this: >

	VIMRUNTIME=`vim -e -T dumb --cmd 'exe "set t_cm=\<C-M>"|echo $VIMRUNTIME|quit' | tr -d '\015' `

==============================================================================
6. Suspending						*suspend*

					*iconize* *iconise* *CTRL-Z* *v_CTRL-Z*
CTRL-Z			Suspend Vim, like ":stop".
			Works in Normal and in Visual mode.  In Insert and
			Command-line mode, the CTRL-Z is inserted as a normal
			character.  In Visual mode Vim goes back to Normal
			mode.
			Note: if CTRL-Z undoes a change see |mswin.vim|.


:sus[pend][!]	or			*:sus* *:suspend* *:st* *:stop*
:st[op][!]		Suspend Vim.
			If the '!' is not given and 'autowrite' is set, every
			buffer with changes and a file name is written out.
			If the '!' is given or 'autowrite' is not set, changed
			buffers are not written, don't forget to bring Vim
			back to the foreground later!

In the GUI, suspending is implemented as iconising gvim.  In Windows 95/NT,
gvim is minimized.

On many Unix systems, it is possible to suspend Vim with CTRL-Z.  This is only
possible in Normal and Visual mode (see next chapter, |vim-modes|).  Vim will
continue if you make it the foreground job again.  On other systems, CTRL-Z
will start a new shell.  This is the same as the ":sh" command.  Vim will
continue if you exit from the shell.

In X-windows the selection is disowned when Vim suspends.  this means you
can't paste it in another application (since Vim is going to sleep an attempt
to get the selection would make the program hang).

==============================================================================
7. Saving settings					*save-settings*

Mostly you will edit your vimrc files manually.  This gives you the greatest
flexibility.  There are a few commands to generate a vimrc file automatically.
You can use these files as they are, or copy/paste lines to include in another
vimrc file.

							*:mk* *:mkexrc*
:mk[exrc] [file]	Write current key mappings and changed options to
			[file] (default ".exrc" in the current directory),
			unless it already exists.  {not in Vi}

:mk[exrc]! [file]	Always write current key mappings and changed
			options to [file] (default ".exrc" in the current
			directory).  {not in Vi}

							*:mkv* *:mkvimrc*
:mkv[imrc][!] [file]	Like ":mkexrc", but the default is ".vimrc" in the
			current directory.  The ":version" command is also
			written to the file.  {not in Vi}

These commands will write ":map" and ":set" commands to a file, in such a way
that when these commands are executed, the current key mappings and options
will be set to the same values.  The options 'columns', 'endofline',
'fileformat', 'key', 'lines', 'modified', 'scroll', 'term', 'textmode',
'ttyfast' and 'ttymouse' are not included, because these are terminal or file
dependent.  Note that the options 'binary', 'paste' and 'readonly' are
included, this might not always be what you want.

When special keys are used in mappings, The 'cpoptions' option will be
temporarily set to its Vim default, to avoid the mappings to be
misinterpreted.  This makes the file incompatible with Vi, but makes sure it
can be used with different terminals.

Only global mappings are stored, not mappings local to a buffer.

A common method is to use a default ".vimrc" file, make some modifications
with ":map" and ":set" commands and write the modified file.  First read the
default ".vimrc" in with a command like ":source ~piet/.vimrc.Cprogs", change
the settings and then save them in the current directory with ":mkvimrc!".  If
you want to make this file your default .vimrc, move it to your home directory
(on Unix), s: (Amiga) or $VIM directory (MS-DOS).  You could also use
autocommands |autocommand| and/or modelines |modeline|.

						*vimrc-option-example*
If you only want to add a single option setting to your vimrc, you can use
these steps:
1. Edit your vimrc file with Vim.
2. Play with the option until it's right.  E.g., try out different values for
   'guifont'.
3. Append a line to set the value of the option, using the expression register
   '=' to enter the value.  E.g., for the 'guifont' option: >
   o:set guifont=<C-R>=&guifont<CR><Esc>
<  [<C-R> is a CTRL-R, <CR> is a return, <Esc> is the escape key]
   You need to escape special characters, esp. spaces.

Note that when you create a .vimrc file, this can influence the 'compatible'
option, which has several side effects.  See |'compatible'|.
":mkvimrc", ":mkexrc" and ":mksession" write the command to set or reset the
'compatible' option to the output file first, because of these side effects.

==============================================================================
8. Views and Sessions					*views-sessions*

This is introduced in sections |21.4| and |21.5| of the user manual.

						*View* *view-file*
A View is a collection of settings that apply to one window.  You can save a
View and when you restore it later, the text is displayed in the same way.
The options and mappings in this window will also be restored, so that you can
continue editing like when the View was saved.

						*Session* *session-file*
A Session keeps the Views for all windows, plus the global settings.  You can
save a Session and when you restore it later the window layout looks the same.
You can use a Session to quickly switch between different projects,
automatically loading the files you were last working on in that project.

Views and Sessions are a nice addition to viminfo-files, which are used to
remember information for all Views and Sessions together |viminfo-file|.

You can quickly start editing with a previously saved View or Session with the
|-S| argument: >
	vim -S Session.vim
<
All this is {not in Vi} and {not available when compiled without the
|+mksession| feature}.

							*:mks* *:mksession*
:mks[ession][!] [file]	Write a Vim script that restores the current editing
			session.
			When [!] is included an existing file is overwritten.
			When [file] is omitted "Session.vim" is used.

The output of ":mksession" is like ":mkvimrc", but additional commands are
added to the file.  Which ones depends on the 'sessionoptions' option.  The
resulting file, when executed with a ":source" command:
1. Restores global mappings and options, if 'sessionoptions' contains
   "options".  Script-local mappings will not be written.
2. Restores global variables that start with an uppercase letter and contain
   at least one lowercase letter, if 'sessionoptions' contains "globals".
3. Unloads all currently loaded buffers.
4. Restores the current directory if 'sessionoptions' contains "curdir", or
   sets the current directory to where the Session file is if 'sessionoptions'
   contains "sesdir".
5. Restores GUI Vim window position, if 'sessionoptions' contains "winpos".
6. Restores screen size, if 'sessionoptions' contains "resize".
7. Reloads the buffer list, with the last cursor positions.  If
   'sessionoptions' contains "buffers" then all buffers are restored,
   including hidden and unloaded buffers.  Otherwise only buffers in windows
   are restored.
8. Restores all windows with the same layout.  If 'sessionoptions' contains
   "help", help windows are restored.  If 'sessionoptions' contains "blank",
   windows editing a buffer without a name will be restored.
   If 'sessionoptions' contains "winsize" and no (help/blank) windows were
   left out, the window sizes are restored (relative to the screen size).
   Otherwise, the windows are just given sensible sizes.
9. Restores the Views for all the windows, as with |:mkview|.  But
   'sessionoptions' is used instead of 'viewoptions'.
10. If a file exists with the same name as the Session file, but ending in
   "x.vim" (for eXtra), executes that as well.  You can use *x.vim files to
   specify additional settings and actions associated with a given Session,
   such as creating menu items in the GUI version.

After restoring the Session, the full filename of your current Session is
available in the internal variable "v:this_session" |this_session-variable|.
An example mapping: >
  :nmap <F2> :wa<Bar>exe "mksession! " . v:this_session<CR>:so ~/sessions/
This saves the current Session, and starts off the command to load another.

A session includes all tab pages, unless "tabpages" was removed from
'sessionoptions'. |tab-page|

The |SessionLoadPost| autocmd event is triggered after a session file is
loaded/sourced.
						*SessionLoad-variable*
While the session file is loading the SessionLoad global variable is set to 1.
Plugins can use this to postpone some work until the SessionLoadPost event is
triggered.

							*:mkvie* *:mkview*
:mkvie[w][!] [file]	Write a Vim script that restores the contents of the
			current window.
			When [!] is included an existing file is overwritten.
			When [file] is omitted or is a number from 1 to 9, a
			name is generated and 'viewdir' prepended.  When the
			last path part of 'viewdir' does not exist, this
			directory is created.  E.g., when 'viewdir' is
			"$VIM/vimfiles/view" then "view" is created in
			"$VIM/vimfiles".
			An existing file is always overwritten then.  Use
			|:loadview| to load this view again.
			When [file] is the name of a file ('viewdir' is not
			used), a command to edit the file is added to the
			generated file.

The output of ":mkview" contains these items:
1. The argument list used in the window.  When the global argument list is
   used it is reset to the global list.
   The index in the argument list is also restored.
2. The file being edited in the window.  If there is no file, the window is
   made empty.
3. Restore mappings, abbreviations and options local to the window if
   'viewoptions' contains "options" or "localoptions".  For the options it
   restores only values that are local to the current buffer and values local
   to the window.
   When storing the view as part of a session and "options" is in
   'sessionoptions', global values for local options will be stored too.
4. Restore folds when using manual folding and 'viewoptions' contains
   "folds".  Restore manually opened and closed folds.
5. The scroll position and the cursor position in the file.  Doesn't work very
   well when there are closed folds.
6. The local current directory, if it is different from the global current
   directory.

Note that Views and Sessions are not perfect:
- They don't restore everything.  For example, defined functions, autocommands
  and ":syntax on" are not included.  Things like register contents and
  command line history are in viminfo, not in Sessions or Views.
- Global option values are only set when they differ from the default value.
  When the current value is not the default value, loading a Session will not
  set it back to the default value.  Local options will be set back to the
  default value though.
- Existing mappings will be overwritten without warning.  An existing mapping
  may cause an error for ambiguity.
- When storing manual folds and when storing manually opened/closed folds,
  changes in the file between saving and loading the view will mess it up.
- The Vim script is not very efficient.  But still faster than typing the
  commands yourself!

							*:lo* *:loadview*
:lo[adview] [nr]	Load the view for the current file.  When [nr] is
			omitted, the view stored with ":mkview" is loaded.
			When [nr] is specified, the view stored with ":mkview
			[nr]" is loaded.

The combination of ":mkview" and ":loadview" can be used to store up to ten
different views of a file.  These are remembered in the directory specified
with the 'viewdir' option.  The views are stored using the file name.  If a
file is renamed or accessed through a (symbolic) link the view will not be
found.

You might want to clean up your 'viewdir' directory now and then.

To automatically save and restore views for *.c files: >
	au BufWinLeave *.c mkview
	au BufWinEnter *.c silent loadview

==============================================================================
9. The viminfo file				*viminfo* *viminfo-file* *E136*
						*E575* *E576* *E577*
If you exit Vim and later start it again, you would normally lose a lot of
information.  The viminfo file can be used to remember that information, which
enables you to continue where you left off.

This is introduced in section |21.3| of the user manual.

The viminfo file is used to store:
- The command line history.
- The search string history.
- The input-line history.
- Contents of non-empty registers.
- Marks for several files.
- File marks, pointing to locations in files.
- Last search/substitute pattern (for 'n' and '&').
- The buffer list.
- Global variables.

The viminfo file is not supported when the |+viminfo| feature has been
disabled at compile time.

You could also use a Session file.  The difference is that the viminfo file
does not depend on what you are working on.  There normally is only one
viminfo file.  Session files are used to save the state of a specific editing
Session.  You could have several Session files, one for each project you are
working on.  Viminfo and Session files together can be used to effectively
enter Vim and directly start working in your desired setup. |session-file|

							*viminfo-read*
When Vim is started and the 'viminfo' option is non-empty, the contents of
the viminfo file are read and the info can be used in the appropriate places.
The |v:oldfiles| variable is filled.  The marks are not read in at startup
(but file marks are).  See |initialization| for how to set the 'viminfo'
option upon startup.

							*viminfo-write*
When Vim exits and 'viminfo' is non-empty, the info is stored in the viminfo
file (it's actually merged with the existing one, if one exists).  The
'viminfo' option is a string containing information about what info should be
stored, and contains limits on how much should be stored (see 'viminfo').

Notes for Unix:
- The file protection for the viminfo file will be set to prevent other users
  from being able to read it, because it may contain any text or commands that
  you have worked with.
- If you want to share the viminfo file with other users (e.g. when you "su"
  to another user), you can make the file writable for the group or everybody.
  Vim will preserve this when writing new viminfo files.  Be careful, don't
  allow just anybody to read and write your viminfo file!
- Vim will not overwrite a viminfo file that is not writable by the current
  "real" user.  This helps for when you did "su" to become root, but your
  $HOME is still set to a normal user's home directory.  Otherwise Vim would
  create a viminfo file owned by root that nobody else can read.
- The viminfo file cannot be a symbolic link.  This is to avoid security
  issues.

Marks are stored for each file separately.  When a file is read and 'viminfo'
is non-empty, the marks for that file are read from the viminfo file.  NOTE:
The marks are only written when exiting Vim, which is fine because marks are
remembered for all the files you have opened in the current editing session,
unless ":bdel" is used.  If you want to save the marks for a file that you are
about to abandon with ":bdel", use ":wv".  The '[' and ']' marks are not
stored, but the '"' mark is.  The '"' mark is very useful for jumping to the
cursor position when the file was last exited.  No marks are saved for files
that start with any string given with the "r" flag in 'viminfo'.  This can be
used to avoid saving marks for files on removable media (for MS-DOS you would
use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:").
The |v:oldfiles| variable is filled with the file names that the viminfo file
has marks for.

							*viminfo-file-marks*
Uppercase marks ('A to 'Z) are stored when writing the viminfo file.  The
numbered marks ('0 to '9) are a bit special.  When the viminfo file is written
(when exiting or with the ":wviminfo" command), '0 is set to the current cursor
position and file.  The old '0 is moved to '1, '1 to '2, etc.  This
resembles what happens with the "1 to "9 delete registers.  If the current
cursor position is already present in '0 to '9, it is moved to '0, to avoid
having the same position twice.  The result is that with "'0", you can jump
back to the file and line where you exited Vim.  To do that right away, try
using this command: >

	vim -c "normal '0"

In a csh compatible shell you could make an alias for it: >

	alias lvim vim -c '"'normal "'"0'"'

For a bash-like shell: >

	alias lvim='vim -c "normal '\''0"'

Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify for which files no marks should be
remembered.


VIMINFO FILE NAME					*viminfo-file-name*

- The default name of the viminfo file is "$HOME/.viminfo" for Unix and OS/2,
  "s:.viminfo" for Amiga, "$HOME\_viminfo" for MS-DOS and Win32.  For the last
  two, when $HOME is not set, "$VIM\_viminfo" is used.  When $VIM is also not
  set, "c:\_viminfo" is used.  For OS/2 "$VIM/.viminfo" is used when $HOME is
  not set and $VIM is set.
- The 'n' flag in the 'viminfo' option can be used to specify another viminfo
  file name |'viminfo'|.
- The "-i" Vim argument can be used to set another file name, |-i|.  When the
  file name given is "NONE" (all uppercase), no viminfo file is ever read or
  written.  Also not for the commands below!
- For the commands below, another file name can be given, overriding the
  default and the name given with 'viminfo' or "-i" (unless it's NONE).


CHARACTER ENCODING					*viminfo-encoding*

The text in the viminfo file is encoded as specified with the 'encoding'
option.  Normally you will always work with the same 'encoding' value, and
this works just fine.  However, if you read the viminfo file with another
value for 'encoding' than what it was written with, some of the text
(non-ASCII characters) may be invalid.  If this is unacceptable, add the 'c'
flag to the 'viminfo' option: >
	:set viminfo+=c
Vim will then attempt to convert the text in the viminfo file from the
'encoding' value it was written with to the current 'encoding' value.  This
requires Vim to be compiled with the |+iconv| feature.  Filenames are not
converted.


MANUALLY READING AND WRITING				*viminfo-read-write*

Two commands can be used to read and write the viminfo file manually.  This
can be used to exchange registers between two running Vim programs: First
type ":wv" in one and then ":rv" in the other.  Note that if the register
already contained something, then ":rv!" would be required.  Also note
however that this means everything will be overwritten with information from
the first Vim, including the command line history, etc.

The viminfo file itself can be edited by hand too, although we suggest you
start with an existing one to get the format right.  It is reasonably
self-explanatory once you're in there.  This can be useful in order to
create a second file, say "~/.my_viminfo" which could contain certain
settings that you always want when you first start Vim.  For example, you
can preload registers with particular data, or put certain commands in the
command line history.  A line in your .vimrc file like >
	:rviminfo! ~/.my_viminfo
can be used to load this information.  You could even have different viminfos
for different types of files (e.g., C code) and load them based on the file
name, using the ":autocmd" command (see |:autocmd|).

							*viminfo-errors*
When Vim detects an error while reading a viminfo file, it will not overwrite
that file.  If there are more than 10 errors, Vim stops reading the viminfo
file.  This was done to avoid accidentally destroying a file when the file
name of the viminfo file is wrong.  This could happen when accidentally typing
"vim -i file" when you wanted "vim -R file" (yes, somebody accidentally did
that!).  If you want to overwrite a viminfo file with an error in it, you will
either have to fix the error, or delete the file (while Vim is running, so
most of the information will be restored).

						   *:rv* *:rviminfo* *E195*
:rv[iminfo][!] [file]	Read from viminfo file [file] (default: see above).
			If [!] is given, then any information that is
			already set (registers, marks, |v:oldfiles|, etc.)
			will be overwritten   {not in Vi}

				*:wv* *:wviminfo* *E137* *E138* *E574* *E886*
:wv[iminfo][!] [file]	Write to viminfo file [file] (default: see above).
			The information in the file is first read in to make
			a merge between old and new info.  When [!] is used,
			the old information is not read first, only the
			internal info is written.  If 'viminfo' is empty, marks
			for up to 100 files will be written.
			When you get error "E138: Can't write viminfo file"
			check that no old temp files were left behind (e.g.
			~/.viminf*) and that you can write in the directory of
			the .viminfo file.
			{not in Vi}

						*:ol* *:oldfiles*
:ol[dfiles]		List the files that have marks stored in the viminfo
			file.  This list is read on startup and only changes
			afterwards with ":rviminfo!".  Also see |v:oldfiles|.
			The number can be used with |c_#<|.
			{not in Vi, only when compiled with the |+eval|
			feature}

:bro[wse] ol[dfiles][!]
			List file names as with |:oldfiles|, and then prompt
			for a number.  When the number is valid that file from
			the list is edited.
			If you get the |press-enter| prompt you can press "q"
			and still get the prompt to enter a file number.
			Use ! to abandon a modified buffer. |abandon|
			{not when compiled with tiny or small features}

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL	  by Bram Moolenaar


Syntax highlighting		*syntax* *syntax-highlighting* *coloring*

Syntax highlighting enables Vim to show parts of the text in another font or
color.	Those parts can be specific keywords or text matching a pattern.  Vim
doesn't parse the whole file (to keep it fast), so the highlighting has its
limitations.  Lexical highlighting might be a better name, but since everybody
calls it syntax highlighting we'll stick with that.

Vim supports syntax highlighting on all terminals.  But since most ordinary
terminals have very limited highlighting possibilities, it works best in the
GUI version, gvim.

In the User Manual:
|usr_06.txt| introduces syntax highlighting.
|usr_44.txt| introduces writing a syntax file.

2.  Syntax files		|:syn-files|
3.  Syntax loading procedure	|syntax-loading|

6.  :syntax arguments		|:syn-arguments|
7.  Syntax patterns		|:syn-pattern|
8.  Syntax clusters		|:syn-cluster|

15. Highlighting tags		|tag-highlight|
16. Window-local syntax		|:ownsyntax|
17. Color xterms		|xterm-color|
18. When syntax is slow		|:syntime|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

Syntax highlighting is not available when the |+syntax| feature has been
disabled at compile time.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start						*:syn-qstart*

						*:syn-enable* *:syntax-enable*
This command switches on syntax highlighting: >

	:syntax enable

What this command actually does is to execute the command >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim

If the VIM environment variable is not set, Vim will try to find
the path in another way (see |$VIMRUNTIME|).  Usually this works just
fine.  If it doesn't, try setting the VIM environment variable to the
directory where the Vim stuff is located.  For example, if your syntax files
are in the "/usr/vim/vim50/syntax" directory, set $VIMRUNTIME to
"/usr/vim/vim50".  You must do this in the shell, before starting Vim.

							*:syn-on* *:syntax-on*
The ":syntax enable" command will keep your current color settings.  This
allows using ":highlight" commands to set your preferred colors before or
after using this command.  If you want Vim to overrule your settings with the
defaults, use: >
	:syntax on
<
					*:hi-normal* *:highlight-normal*
If you are running in the GUI, you can get white text on a black background
with: >
	:highlight Normal guibg=Black guifg=White
For a color terminal see |:hi-normal-cterm|.
For setting up your own colors syntax highlighting see |syncolor|.

NOTE: The syntax files on MS-DOS and Windows have lines that end in <CR><NL>.
The files for Unix end in <NL>.  This means you should use the right type of
file for your system.  Although on MS-DOS and Windows the right format is
automatically selected if the 'fileformats' option is not empty.

NOTE: When using reverse video ("gvim -fg white -bg black"), the default value
of 'background' will not be set until the GUI window is opened, which is after
reading the |gvimrc|.  This will cause the wrong default highlighting to be
used.  To set the default value of 'background' before switching on
highlighting, include the ":gui" command in the |gvimrc|: >

   :gui		" open window and set default for 'background'
   :syntax on	" start highlighting, use 'background' to set colors

NOTE: Using ":gui" in the |gvimrc| means that "gvim -f" won't start in the
foreground!  Use ":gui -f" then.

							*g:syntax_on*
You can toggle the syntax on/off with this command: >
   :if exists("g:syntax_on") | syntax off | else | syntax enable | endif

To put this into a mapping, you can use: >
   :map <F7> :if exists("g:syntax_on") <Bar>
	\   syntax off <Bar>
	\ else <Bar>
	\   syntax enable <Bar>
	\ endif <CR>
[using the |<>| notation, type this literally]

Details:
The ":syntax" commands are implemented by sourcing a file.  To see exactly how
this works, look in the file:
    command		file ~
    :syntax enable	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax on		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax manual	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/manual.vim
    :syntax off		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
Also see |syntax-loading|.

NOTE: If displaying long lines is slow and switching off syntax highlighting
makes it fast, consider setting the 'synmaxcol' option to a lower value.

==============================================================================
2. Syntax files						*:syn-files*

The syntax and highlighting commands for one language are normally stored in
a syntax file.	The name convention is: "{name}.vim".  Where {name} is the
name of the language, or an abbreviation (to fit the name in 8.3 characters,
a requirement in case the file is used on a DOS filesystem).
Examples:
	c.vim		perl.vim	java.vim	html.vim
	cpp.vim		sh.vim		csh.vim

The syntax file can contain any Ex commands, just like a vimrc file.  But
the idea is that only commands for a specific language are included.  When a
language is a superset of another language, it may include the other one,
for example, the cpp.vim file could include the c.vim file: >
   :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/c.vim

The .vim files are normally loaded with an autocommand.  For example: >
   :au Syntax c	    runtime! syntax/c.vim
   :au Syntax cpp   runtime! syntax/cpp.vim
These commands are normally in the file $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/synload.vim.


MAKING YOUR OWN SYNTAX FILES				*mysyntaxfile*

When you create your own syntax files, and you want to have Vim use these
automatically with ":syntax enable", do this:

1. Create your user runtime directory.	You would normally use the first item
   of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim

2. Create a directory in there called "syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim/syntax

3. Write the Vim syntax file.  Or download one from the internet.  Then write
   it in your syntax directory.  For example, for the "mine" syntax: >
	:w ~/.vim/syntax/mine.vim

Now you can start using your syntax file manually: >
	:set syntax=mine
You don't have to exit Vim to use this.

If you also want Vim to detect the type of file, see |new-filetype|.

If you are setting up a system with many users and you don't want each user
to add the same syntax file, you can use another directory from 'runtimepath'.


ADDING TO AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE		*mysyntaxfile-add*

If you are mostly satisfied with an existing syntax file, but would like to
add a few items or change the highlighting, follow these steps:

1. Create your user directory from 'runtimepath', see above.

2. Create a directory in there called "after/syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim/after
	mkdir ~/.vim/after/syntax

3. Write a Vim script that contains the commands you want to use.  For
   example, to change the colors for the C syntax: >
	highlight cComment ctermfg=Green guifg=Green

4. Write that file in the "after/syntax" directory.  Use the name of the
   syntax, with ".vim" added.  For our C syntax: >
	:w ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim

That's it.  The next time you edit a C file the Comment color will be
different.  You don't even have to restart Vim.

If you have multiple files, you can use the filetype as the directory name.
All the "*.vim" files in this directory will be used, for example:
	~/.vim/after/syntax/c/one.vim
	~/.vim/after/syntax/c/two.vim


REPLACING AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE			*mysyntaxfile-replace*

If you don't like a distributed syntax file, or you have downloaded a new
version, follow the same steps as for |mysyntaxfile| above.  Just make sure
that you write the syntax file in a directory that is early in 'runtimepath'.
Vim will only load the first syntax file found, assuming that it sets
b:current_syntax.


NAMING CONVENTIONS		    *group-name* *{group-name}* *E669* *W18*

A syntax group name is to be used for syntax items that match the same kind of
thing.  These are then linked to a highlight group that specifies the color.
A syntax group name doesn't specify any color or attributes itself.

The name for a highlight or syntax group must consist of ASCII letters, digits
and the underscore.  As a regexp: "[a-zA-Z0-9_]*"

To be able to allow each user to pick his favorite set of colors, there must
be preferred names for highlight groups that are common for many languages.
These are the suggested group names (if syntax highlighting works properly
you can see the actual color, except for "Ignore"):

	*Comment	any comment

	*Constant	any constant
	 String		a string constant: "this is a string"
	 Character	a character constant: 'c', '\n'
	 Number		a number constant: 234, 0xff
	 Boolean	a boolean constant: TRUE, false
	 Float		a floating point constant: 2.3e10

	*Identifier	any variable name
	 Function	function name (also: methods for classes)

	*Statement	any statement
	 Conditional	if, then, else, endif, switch, etc.
	 Repeat		for, do, while, etc.
	 Label		case, default, etc.
	 Operator	"sizeof", "+", "*", etc.
	 Keyword	any other keyword
	 Exception	try, catch, throw

	*PreProc	generic Preprocessor
	 Include	preprocessor #include
	 Define		preprocessor #define
	 Macro		same as Define
	 PreCondit	preprocessor #if, #else, #endif, etc.

	*Type		int, long, char, etc.
	 StorageClass	static, register, volatile, etc.
	 Structure	struct, union, enum, etc.
	 Typedef	A typedef

	*Special	any special symbol
	 SpecialChar	special character in a constant
	 Tag		you can use CTRL-] on this
	 Delimiter	character that needs attention
	 SpecialComment	special things inside a comment
	 Debug		debugging statements

	*Underlined	text that stands out, HTML links

	*Ignore		left blank, hidden  |hl-Ignore|

	*Error		any erroneous construct

	*Todo		anything that needs extra attention; mostly the
			keywords TODO FIXME and XXX

The names marked with * are the preferred groups; the others are minor groups.
For the preferred groups, the "syntax.vim" file contains default highlighting.
The minor groups are linked to the preferred groups, so they get the same
highlighting.  You can override these defaults by using ":highlight" commands
after sourcing the "syntax.vim" file.

Note that highlight group names are not case sensitive.  "String" and "string"
can be used for the same group.

The following names are reserved and cannot be used as a group name:
	NONE   ALL   ALLBUT   contains	 contained

							*hl-Ignore*
When using the Ignore group, you may also consider using the conceal
mechanism.  See |conceal|.

==============================================================================
3. Syntax loading procedure				*syntax-loading*

This explains the details that happen when the command ":syntax enable" is
issued.  When Vim initializes itself, it finds out where the runtime files are
located.  This is used here as the variable |$VIMRUNTIME|.

":syntax enable" and ":syntax on" do the following:

    Source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    |
    +-	Clear out any old syntax by sourcing $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
    |
    +-	Source first syntax/synload.vim in 'runtimepath'
    |	|
    |	+-  Setup the colors for syntax highlighting.  If a color scheme is
    |	|   defined it is loaded again with ":colors {name}".  Otherwise
    |	|   ":runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim" is used.  ":syntax on" overrules
    |	|   existing colors, ":syntax enable" only sets groups that weren't
    |	|   set yet.
    |	|
    |	+-  Set up syntax autocmds to load the appropriate syntax file when
    |	|   the 'syntax' option is set. *synload-1*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the |mysyntaxfile| variable.
    |	    This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only. *synload-2*
    |
    +-	Do ":filetype on", which does ":runtime! filetype.vim".  It loads any
    |	filetype.vim files found.  It should always Source
    |	$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Install autocmds based on suffix to set the 'filetype' option
    |	|   This is where the connection between file name and file type is
    |	|   made for known file types. *synload-3*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myfiletypefile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|   *synload-4*
    |	|
    |	+-  Install one autocommand which sources scripts.vim when no file
    |	|   type was detected yet. *synload-5*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim, to setup the Syntax menu. |menu.vim|
    |
    +-	Install a FileType autocommand to set the 'syntax' option when a file
    |	type has been detected. *synload-6*
    |
    +-	Execute syntax autocommands to start syntax highlighting for each
	already loaded buffer.


Upon loading a file, Vim finds the relevant syntax file as follows:

    Loading the file triggers the BufReadPost autocommands.
    |
    +-	If there is a match with one of the autocommands from |synload-3|
    |	(known file types) or |synload-4| (user's file types), the 'filetype'
    |	option is set to the file type.
    |
    +-	The autocommand at |synload-5| is triggered.  If the file type was not
    |	found yet, then scripts.vim is searched for in 'runtimepath'.  This
    |	should always load $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myscriptsfile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|
    |	+-  If the file type is still unknown, check the contents of the file,
    |	    again with checks like "getline(1) =~ pattern" as to whether the
    |	    file type can be recognized, and set 'filetype'.
    |
    +-	When the file type was determined and 'filetype' was set, this
    |	triggers the FileType autocommand |synload-6| above.  It sets
    |	'syntax' to the determined file type.
    |
    +-	When the 'syntax' option was set above, this triggers an autocommand
    |	from |synload-1| (and |synload-2|).  This find the main syntax file in
    |	'runtimepath', with this command:
    |		runtime! syntax/<name>.vim
    |
    +-	Any other user installed FileType or Syntax autocommands are
	triggered.  This can be used to change the highlighting for a specific
	syntax.

==============================================================================
4. Syntax file remarks					*:syn-file-remarks*

						*b:current_syntax-variable*
Vim stores the name of the syntax that has been loaded in the
"b:current_syntax" variable.  You can use this if you want to load other
settings, depending on which syntax is active.	Example: >
   :au BufReadPost * if b:current_syntax == "csh"
   :au BufReadPost *   do-some-things
   :au BufReadPost * endif


2HTML						*2html.vim* *convert-to-HTML*

This is not a syntax file itself, but a script that converts the current
window into HTML. Vim opens a new window in which it builds the HTML file.

After you save the resulting file, you can view it with any browser. The
colors should be exactly the same as you see them in Vim.  With
|g:html_line_ids| you can jump to specific lines by adding (for example) #L123
or #123 to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar. And with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| enabled, you can show or hide the text that is folded
in Vim.

You are not supposed to set the 'filetype' or 'syntax' option to "2html"!
Source the script to convert the current file: >

	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
Many variables affect the output of 2html.vim; see below. Any of the on/off
options listed below can be enabled or disabled by setting them explicitly to
the desired value, or restored to their default by removing the variable using
|:unlet|.

Remarks:
- Some truly ancient browsers may not show the background colors.
- From most browsers you can also print the file (in color)!
- The latest TOhtml may actually work with older versions of Vim, but some
  features such as conceal support will not function, and the colors may be
  incorrect for an old Vim without GUI support compiled in.

Here is an example how to run the script over all .c and .h files from a
Unix shell: >
   for f in *.[ch]; do gvim -f +"syn on" +"run! syntax/2html.vim" +"wq" +"q" $f; done
<
					*g:html_start_line* *g:html_end_line*
To restrict the conversion to a range of lines, use a range with the |:TOhtml|
command below, or set "g:html_start_line" and "g:html_end_line" to the first
and last line to be converted.  Example, using the last set Visual area: >

	:let g:html_start_line = line("'<")
	:let g:html_end_line = line("'>")
	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
							*:TOhtml*
:[range]TOhtml		The ":TOhtml" command is defined in a standard plugin.
			This command will source |2html.vim| for you. When a
			range is given, set |g:html_start_line| and
			|g:html_end_line| to the start and end of the range,
			respectively. Default range is the entire buffer.

                        If the current window is part of a |diff|, unless
                        |g:html_diff_one_file| is set, :TOhtml will convert
                        all windows which are part of the diff in the current
                        tab and place them side-by-side in a <table> element
                        in the generated HTML. With |g:html_line_ids| you can
                        jump to lines in specific windows with (for example)
                        #W1L42 for line 42 in the first diffed window, or
                        #W3L87 for line 87 in the third.

			Examples: >

	:10,40TOhtml " convert lines 10-40 to html
	:'<,'>TOhtml " convert current/last visual selection
	:TOhtml      " convert entire buffer
<
							*g:html_diff_one_file*
Default: 0.
When 0, and using |:TOhtml| all windows involved in a |diff| in the current tab
page are converted to HTML and placed side-by-side in a <table> element. When
1, only the current buffer is converted.
Example: >

	let g:html_diff_one_file = 1
<
							 *g:html_whole_filler*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_diff_one_file| is 1, a sequence of more than 3 filler lines
is displayed as three lines with the middle line mentioning the total number
of inserted lines.
When 1, always display all inserted lines as if |g:html_diff_one_file| were
not set.
>
    :let g:html_whole_filler = 1
<
				     *TOhtml-performance* *g:html_no_progress*
Default: 0.
When 0, display a progress bar in the statusline for each major step in the
2html.vim conversion process.
When 1, do not display the progress bar. This offers a minor speed improvement
but you won't have any idea how much longer the conversion might take; for big
files it can take a long time!
Example: >

	let g:html_no_progress = 1
<
You can obtain better performance improvements by also instructing Vim to not
run interactively, so that too much time is not taken to redraw as the script
moves through the buffer, switches windows, and the like: >

  vim -E -s -c "let g:html_no_progress=1" -c "syntax on" -c "set ft=c" -c "runtime syntax/2html.vim" -cwqa myfile.c
<
Note that the -s flag prevents loading your .vimrc and any plugins, so you
need to explicitly source/enable anything that will affect the HTML
conversion. See |-E| and |-s-ex| for details. It is probably best to create a
script to replace all the -c commands and use it with the -u flag instead of
specifying each command separately.

							 *g:html_number_lines*
Default: current 'number' setting.
When 0, buffer text is displayed in the generated HTML without line numbering.
When 1, a column of line numbers is added to the generated HTML with the same
highlighting as the line number column in Vim (|hl-LineNr|).
Force line numbers even if 'number' is not set: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 1
Force to omit the line numbers: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 0
Go back to the default to use 'number' by deleting the variable: >
   :unlet g:html_number_lines
<
                                                             *g:html_line_ids*
Default: 1 if |g:html_number_lines| is set, 0 otherwise.
When 1, adds an HTML id attribute to each line number, or to an empty <span>
inserted for that purpose if no line numbers are shown. This ID attribute
takes the form of L123 for single-buffer HTML pages, or W2L123 for diff-view
pages, and is used to jump to a specific line (in a specific window of a diff
view). Javascript is inserted to open any closed dynamic folds
(|g:html_dynamic_folds|) containing the specified line before jumping. The
javascript also allows omitting the window ID in the url, and the leading L.
For example: >

	page.html#L123	jumps to line 123 in a single-buffer file
	page.html#123	does the same

	diff.html#W1L42	jumps to line 42 in the first window in a diff
	diff.html#42	does the same
<
							      *g:html_use_css*
Default: 1.
When 1, generate valid HTML 4.01 markup with CSS1 styling, supported in all
modern browsers and most old browsers.
When 0, generate <font> tags and similar outdated markup. This is not
recommended but it may work better in really old browsers, email clients,
forum posts, and similar situations where basic CSS support is unavailable.
Example: >
   :let g:html_use_css = 0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_conceal*
Default: 0.
When 0, concealed text is removed from the HTML and replaced with a character
from |:syn-cchar| or 'listchars' as appropriate, depending on the current
value of 'conceallevel'.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML, even if it is
|conceal|ed.

Either of the following commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is
included in the generated HTML (unless it is folded): >
   :let g:html_ignore_conceal = 1
   :setl conceallevel=0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_folding*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is replaced by the text shown for the fold in
Vim (|fold-foldtext|). See |g:html_dynamic_folds| if you also want to allow
the user to expand the fold as in Vim to see the text inside.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML; whether the
text is in a fold has no impact at all. |g:html_dynamic_folds| has no effect.

Either of these commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is included
in the generated HTML (unless it is concealed): >
   zR
   :let g:html_ignore_folding = 1
<
							*g:html_dynamic_folds*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is not included at all in the generated HTML.
When 1, generate javascript to open a fold and show the text within, just like
in Vim.

Setting this variable to 1 causes 2html.vim to always use CSS for styling,
regardless of what |g:html_use_css| is set to.

This variable is ignored when |g:html_ignore_folding| is set.
>
   :let g:html_dynamic_folds = 1
<
							*g:html_no_foldcolumn*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_dynamic_folds| is 1, generate a column of text similar to
Vim's foldcolumn (|fold-foldcolumn|) the user can click on to toggle folds
open or closed. The minimum width of the generated text column is the current
'foldcolumn' setting.
When 1, do not generate this column; instead, hovering the mouse cursor over
folded text will open the fold as if |g:html_hover_unfold| were set.
>
   :let g:html_no_foldcolumn = 1
<
				*TOhtml-uncopyable-text* *g:html_prevent_copy*
Default: empty string.
This option prevents certain regions of the generated HTML from being copied,
when you select all text in document rendered in a browser and copy it. Useful
for allowing users to copy-paste only the source text even if a fold column or
line numbers are shown in the generated content. Specify regions to be
affected in this way as follows:
	f:	fold column
	n:	line numbers (also within fold text)
	t:	fold text
	d:	diff filler

Example, to make the fold column and line numbers uncopyable: >
	:let g:html_prevent_copy = "fn"
<
This feature is currently implemented by inserting read-only <input> elements
into the markup to contain the uncopyable areas. This does not work well in
all cases. When pasting to some applications which understand HTML, the
<input> elements also get pasted. But plain-text paste destinations should
always work.

							   *g:html_no_invalid*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty, an invalid attribute is
intentionally inserted into the <input> element for the uncopyable areas. This
increases the number of applications you can paste to without also pasting the
<input> elements. Specifically, Microsoft Word will not paste the <input>
elements if they contain this invalid attribute.
When 1, no invalid markup is ever intentionally inserted, and the generated
page should validate. However, be careful pasting into Microsoft Word when
|g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty; it can be hard to get rid of the <input>
elements which get pasted.

							 *g:html_hover_unfold*
Default: 0.
When 0, the only way to open a fold generated by 2html.vim with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| set, is to click on the generated fold column.
When 1, use CSS 2.0 to allow the user to open a fold by moving the mouse
cursor over the displayed fold text. This is useful to allow users with
disabled javascript to view the folded text.

Note that old browsers (notably Internet Explorer 6) will not support this
feature.  Browser-specific markup for IE6 is included to fall back to the
normal CSS1 styling so that the folds show up correctly for this browser, but
they will not be openable without a foldcolumn.
>
   :let g:html_hover_unfold = 1
<
							      *g:html_id_expr*
Default: ""
Dynamic folding and jumping to line IDs rely on unique IDs within the document
to work. If generated HTML is copied into a larger document, these IDs are no
longer guaranteed to be unique. Set g:html_id_expr to an expression Vim can
evaluate to get a unique string to append to each ID used in a given document,
so that the full IDs will be unique even when combined with other content in a
larger HTML document. Example, to append _ and the buffer number to each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_".bufnr("%")'
<
To append a string "_mystring" to the end of each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_mystring"'
<
Note, when converting a diff view to HTML, the expression will only be
evaluated for the first window in the diff, and the result used for all the
windows.

					  *TOhtml-wrap-text* *g:html_pre_wrap*
Default: current 'wrap' setting.
When 0, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, the text in the generated HTML does
not wrap at the edge of the browser window.
When 1, if |g:html_use_css| is 1, the CSS 2.0 "white-space:pre-wrap" value is
used, causing the text to wrap at whitespace at the edge of the browser
window.
Explicitly enable text wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 1
Explicitly disable wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 0
Go back to default, determine wrapping from 'wrap' setting: >
   :unlet g:html_pre_wrap
<
							       *g:html_no_pre*
Default: 0.
When 0, buffer text in the generated HTML is surrounded by <pre>...</pre>
tags. Series of whitespace is shown as in Vim without special markup, and tab
characters can be included literally (see |g:html_expand_tabs|).
When 1 (not recommended), the <pre> tags are omitted, and a plain <div> is
used instead. Whitespace is replaced by a series of &nbsp; character
references, and <br> is used to end each line. This is another way to allow
text in the generated HTML is wrap (see |g:html_pre_wrap|) which also works in
old browsers, but may cause noticeable differences between Vim's display and
the rendered page generated by 2html.vim.
>
   :let g:html_no_pre = 1
<
							  *g:html_expand_tabs*
Default: 1 if 'tabstop' is 8, 'expandtab' is 0, and no fold column or line
		numbers occur in the generated HTML;
	 0 otherwise.
When 0, <Tab> characters in the buffer text are replaced with an appropriate
number of space characters, or &nbsp; references if |g:html_no_pre| is 1.
When 1, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, <Tab> characters in the buffer text
are included as-is in the generated HTML. This is useful for when you want to
allow copy and paste from a browser without losing the actual whitespace in
the source document. Note that this can easily break text alignment and
indentation in the HTML, unless set by default.

Force |2html.vim| to keep <Tab> characters: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 0
<
Force tabs to be expanded: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 1
<
				    *TOhtml-encoding-detect* *TOhtml-encoding*
It is highly recommended to set your desired encoding with
|g:html_use_encoding| for any content which will be placed on a web server.

If you do not specify an encoding, |2html.vim| uses the preferred IANA name
for the current value of 'fileencoding' if set, or 'encoding' if not.
'encoding' is always used for certain 'buftype' values. 'fileencoding' will be
set to match the chosen document encoding.

Automatic detection works for the encodings mentioned specifically by name in
|encoding-names|, but TOhtml will only automatically use those encodings with
wide browser support. However, you can override this to support specific
encodings that may not be automatically detected by default (see options
below). See http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets for the IANA names.

Note, by default all Unicode encodings are converted to UTF-8 with no BOM in
the generated HTML, as recommended by W3C:

	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings
	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark

							 *g:html_use_encoding*
Default: none, uses IANA name for current 'fileencoding' as above.
To overrule all automatic charset detection, set g:html_use_encoding to the
name of the charset to be used. It is recommended to set this variable to
something widely supported, like UTF-8, for anything you will be hosting on a
webserver: >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = "UTF-8"
You can also use this option to omit the line that specifies the charset
entirely, by setting g:html_use_encoding to an empty string (NOT recommended): >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = ""
To go back to the automatic mechanism, delete the |g:html_use_encoding|
variable: >
   :unlet g:html_use_encoding
<
						    *g:html_encoding_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names|.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the correct 'fileencoding' when you
specify an encoding with |g:html_use_encoding| which is not in the default
list of conversions.

This is a dictionary of charset-encoding pairs that will replace existing
pairs automatically detected by TOhtml, or supplement with new pairs.

Detect the HTML charset "windows-1252" as the encoding "8bit-cp1252": >
   :let g:html_encoding_override = {'windows-1252': '8bit-cp1252'}
<
						     *g:html_charset_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names| and which have wide
		browser support.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the HTML charset for any
'fileencoding' or 'encoding' which is not detected automatically. You can also
use it to override specific existing encoding-charset pairs. For example,
TOhtml will by default use UTF-8 for all Unicode/UCS encodings. To use UTF-16
and UTF-32 instead, use: >
   :let g:html_charset_override = {'ucs-4': 'UTF-32', 'utf-16': 'UTF-16'}

Note that documents encoded in either UTF-32 or UTF-16 have known
compatibility problems with some major browsers.

			*convert-to-XML* *convert-to-XHTML* *g:html_use_xhtml*
Default: 0.
When 0, generate standard HTML 4.01 (strict when possible).
When 1, generate XHTML 1.0 instead (XML compliant HTML).
>
    :let g:html_use_xhtml = 1
<

ABEL						*abel.vim* *ft-abel-syntax*

ABEL highlighting provides some user-defined options.  To enable them, assign
any value to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let abel_obsolete_ok=1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet abel_obsolete_ok

Variable			Highlight ~
abel_obsolete_ok		obsolete keywords are statements, not errors
abel_cpp_comments_illegal	do not interpret '//' as inline comment leader


ADA

See |ft-ada-syntax|


ANT						*ant.vim* *ft-ant-syntax*

The ant syntax file provides syntax highlighting for javascript and python
by default.  Syntax highlighting for other script languages can be installed
by the function AntSyntaxScript(), which takes the tag name as first argument
and the script syntax file name as second argument.  Example: >

	:call AntSyntaxScript('perl', 'perl.vim')

will install syntax perl highlighting for the following ant code >

	<script language = 'perl'><![CDATA[
	    # everything inside is highlighted as perl
	]]></script>

See |mysyntaxfile-add| for installing script languages permanently.


APACHE						*apache.vim* *ft-apache-syntax*

The apache syntax file provides syntax highlighting depending on Apache HTTP
server version, by default for 1.3.x.  Set "apache_version" to Apache version
(as a string) to get highlighting for another version.	Example: >

	:let apache_version = "2.0"
<

		*asm.vim* *asmh8300.vim* *nasm.vim* *masm.vim* *asm68k*
ASSEMBLY	*ft-asm-syntax* *ft-asmh8300-syntax* *ft-nasm-syntax*
		*ft-masm-syntax* *ft-asm68k-syntax* *fasm.vim*

Files matching "*.i" could be Progress or Assembly.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_i = "asm"
Replace "asm" with the type of assembly you use.

There are many types of assembly languages that all use the same file name
extensions.  Therefore you will have to select the type yourself, or add a
line in the assembly file that Vim will recognize.  Currently these syntax
files are included:
	asm		GNU assembly (the default)
	asm68k		Motorola 680x0 assembly
	asmh8300	Hitachi H-8300 version of GNU assembly
	ia64		Intel Itanium 64
	fasm		Flat assembly (http://flatassembler.net)
	masm		Microsoft assembly (probably works for any 80x86)
	nasm		Netwide assembly
	tasm		Turbo Assembly (with opcodes 80x86 up to Pentium, and
			MMX)
	pic		PIC assembly (currently for PIC16F84)

The most flexible is to add a line in your assembly file containing: >
	asmsyntax=nasm
Replace "nasm" with the name of the real assembly syntax.  This line must be
one of the first five lines in the file.  No non-white text must be
immediately before or after this text.  Note that specifying asmsyntax=foo is
equivalent to setting ft=foo in a |modeline|, and that in case of a conflict
between the two settings the one from the modeline will take precedence (in
particular, if you have ft=asm in the modeline, you will get the GNU syntax
highlighting regardless of what is specified as asmsyntax).

The syntax type can always be overruled for a specific buffer by setting the
b:asmsyntax variable: >
	:let b:asmsyntax = "nasm"

If b:asmsyntax is not set, either automatically or by hand, then the value of
the global variable asmsyntax is used.	This can be seen as a default assembly
language: >
	:let asmsyntax = "nasm"

As a last resort, if nothing is defined, the "asm" syntax is used.


Netwide assembler (nasm.vim) optional highlighting ~

To enable a feature: >
	:let   {variable}=1|set syntax=nasm
To disable a feature: >
	:unlet {variable}  |set syntax=nasm

Variable		Highlight ~
nasm_loose_syntax	unofficial parser allowed syntax not as Error
			  (parser dependent; not recommended)
nasm_ctx_outside_macro	contexts outside macro not as Error
nasm_no_warn		potentially risky syntax not as ToDo


ASPPERL and ASPVBS			*ft-aspperl-syntax* *ft-aspvbs-syntax*

*.asp and *.asa files could be either Perl or Visual Basic script.  Since it's
hard to detect this you can set two global variables to tell Vim what you are
using.	For Perl script use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspperl"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspperl"
For Visual Basic use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspvbs"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspvbs"


BAAN						    *baan.vim* *baan-syntax*

The baan.vim gives syntax support for BaanC of release BaanIV upto SSA ERP LN
for both 3 GL and 4 GL programming. Large number of standard defines/constants
are supported.

Some special violation of coding standards will be signalled when one specify
in ones |.vimrc|: >
	let baan_code_stds=1

*baan-folding*

Syntax folding can be enabled at various levels through the variables
mentioned below (Set those in your |.vimrc|). The more complex folding on
source blocks and SQL can be CPU intensive.

To allow any folding and enable folding at function level use: >
	let baan_fold=1
Folding can be enabled at source block level as if, while, for ,... The
indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to match (spaces are not
considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_block=1
Folding can be enabled for embedded SQL blocks as SELECT, SELECTDO,
SELECTEMPTY, ... The indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to
match (spaces are not considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_sql=1
Note: Block folding can result in many small folds. It is suggested to |:set|
the options 'foldminlines' and 'foldnestmax' in |.vimrc| or use |:setlocal| in
.../after/syntax/baan.vim (see |after-directory|). Eg: >
	set foldminlines=5
	set foldnestmax=6


BASIC			*basic.vim* *vb.vim* *ft-basic-syntax* *ft-vb-syntax*

Both Visual Basic and "normal" basic use the extension ".bas".	To detect
which one should be used, Vim checks for the string "VB_Name" in the first
five lines of the file.  If it is not found, filetype will be "basic",
otherwise "vb".  Files with the ".frm" extension will always be seen as Visual
Basic.


C							*c.vim* *ft-c-syntax*

A few things in C highlighting are optional.  To enable them assign any value
to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let c_comment_strings = 1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet c_comment_strings

Variable		Highlight ~
c_gnu			GNU gcc specific items
c_comment_strings	strings and numbers inside a comment
c_space_errors		trailing white space and spaces before a <Tab>
c_no_trail_space_error	 ... but no trailing spaces
c_no_tab_space_error	 ... but no spaces before a <Tab>
c_no_bracket_error	don't highlight {}; inside [] as errors
c_no_curly_error	don't highlight {}; inside [] and () as errors;
				except { and } in first column
c_curly_error		highlight a missing }; this forces syncing from the
			start of the file, can be slow
c_no_ansi		don't do standard ANSI types and constants
c_ansi_typedefs		 ... but do standard ANSI types
c_ansi_constants	 ... but do standard ANSI constants
c_no_utf		don't highlight \u and \U in strings
c_syntax_for_h		for *.h files use C syntax instead of C++ and use objc
			syntax instead of objcpp
c_no_if0		don't highlight "#if 0" blocks as comments
c_no_cformat		don't highlight %-formats in strings
c_no_c99		don't highlight C99 standard items
c_no_c11		don't highlight C11 standard items

When 'foldmethod' is set to "syntax" then /* */ comments and { } blocks will
become a fold.  If you don't want comments to become a fold use: >
	:let c_no_comment_fold = 1
"#if 0" blocks are also folded, unless: >
	:let c_no_if0_fold = 1

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "c_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let c_minlines = 100
This will make the syntax synchronization start 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 50 (15 when c_no_if0 is set).  The
disadvantage of using a larger number is that redrawing can become slow.

When using the "#if 0" / "#endif" comment highlighting, notice that this only
works when the "#if 0" is within "c_minlines" from the top of the window.  If
you have a long "#if 0" construct it will not be highlighted correctly.

To match extra items in comments, use the cCommentGroup cluster.
Example: >
   :au Syntax c call MyCadd()
   :function MyCadd()
   :  syn keyword cMyItem contained Ni
   :  syn cluster cCommentGroup add=cMyItem
   :  hi link cMyItem Title
   :endfun

ANSI constants will be highlighted with the "cConstant" group.	This includes
"NULL", "SIG_IGN" and others.  But not "TRUE", for example, because this is
not in the ANSI standard.  If you find this confusing, remove the cConstant
highlighting: >
	:hi link cConstant NONE

If you see '{' and '}' highlighted as an error where they are OK, reset the
highlighting for cErrInParen and cErrInBracket.

If you want to use folding in your C files, you can add these lines in a file
in the "after" directory in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix this would be
~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim. >
    syn sync fromstart
    set foldmethod=syntax

CH						*ch.vim* *ft-ch-syntax*

C/C++ interpreter.  Ch has similar syntax highlighting to C and builds upon
the C syntax file.  See |c.vim| for all the settings that are available for C.

By setting a variable you can tell Vim to use Ch syntax for *.h files, instead
of C or C++: >
	:let ch_syntax_for_h = 1


CHILL						*chill.vim* *ft-chill-syntax*

Chill syntax highlighting is similar to C.  See |c.vim| for all the settings
that are available.  Additionally there is:

chill_space_errors	like c_space_errors
chill_comment_string	like c_comment_strings
chill_minlines		like c_minlines


CHANGELOG				*changelog.vim* *ft-changelog-syntax*

ChangeLog supports highlighting spaces at the start of a line.
If you do not like this, add following line to your .vimrc: >
	let g:changelog_spacing_errors = 0
This works the next time you edit a changelog file.  You can also use
"b:changelog_spacing_errors" to set this per buffer (before loading the syntax
file).

You can change the highlighting used, e.g., to flag the spaces as an error: >
	:hi link ChangelogError Error
Or to avoid the highlighting: >
	:hi link ChangelogError NONE
This works immediately.


CLOJURE							*ft-clojure-syntax*

Setting *g:clojure_fold* enables folding Clojure code via the syntax engine.
Any list, vector, or map that extends over more than one line can be folded
using the standard Vim |fold-commands|.

Please note that this option does not work with scripts that redefine the
bracket syntax regions, such as rainbow-parentheses plugins.

This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fold = 0
<

COBOL						*cobol.vim* *ft-cobol-syntax*

COBOL highlighting has different needs for legacy code than it does for fresh
development.  This is due to differences in what is being done (maintenance
versus development) and other factors.	To enable legacy code highlighting,
add this line to your .vimrc: >
	:let cobol_legacy_code = 1
To disable it again, use this: >
	:unlet cobol_legacy_code


COLD FUSION			*coldfusion.vim* *ft-coldfusion-syntax*

The ColdFusion has its own version of HTML comments.  To turn on ColdFusion
comment highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let html_wrong_comments = 1

The ColdFusion syntax file is based on the HTML syntax file.


CPP						*cpp.vim* *ft-cpp-syntax*

Most of things are same as |ft-c-syntax|.

Variable		Highlight ~
cpp_no_c11		don't highlight C++11 standard items


CSH						*csh.vim* *ft-csh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "csh".  Note that on some systems tcsh is actually
used.

Detecting whether a file is csh or tcsh is notoriously hard.  Some systems
symlink /bin/csh to /bin/tcsh, making it almost impossible to distinguish
between csh and tcsh.  In case VIM guesses wrong you can set the
"filetype_csh" variable.  For using csh:  *g:filetype_csh*
>
	:let g:filetype_csh = "csh"

For using tcsh: >

	:let g:filetype_csh = "tcsh"

Any script with a tcsh extension or a standard tcsh filename (.tcshrc,
tcsh.tcshrc, tcsh.login) will have filetype tcsh.  All other tcsh/csh scripts
will be classified as tcsh, UNLESS the "filetype_csh" variable exists.  If the
"filetype_csh" variable exists, the filetype will be set to the value of the
variable.


CYNLIB						*cynlib.vim* *ft-cynlib-syntax*

Cynlib files are C++ files that use the Cynlib class library to enable
hardware modelling and simulation using C++.  Typically Cynlib files have a .cc
or a .cpp extension, which makes it very difficult to distinguish them from a
normal C++ file.  Thus, to enable Cynlib highlighting for .cc files, add this
line to your .vimrc file: >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cc=1

Similarly for cpp files (this extension is only usually used in Windows) >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp=1

To disable these again, use this: >

	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cc
	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp
<

CWEB						*cweb.vim* *ft-cweb-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "cweb"


DESKTOP					   *desktop.vim* *ft-desktop-syntax*

Primary goal of this syntax file is to highlight .desktop and .directory files
according to freedesktop.org standard:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
But actually almost none implements this standard fully.  Thus it will
highlight all Unix ini files.  But you can force strict highlighting according
to standard by placing this in your vimrc file: >
	:let enforce_freedesktop_standard = 1


DIRCOLORS			       *dircolors.vim* *ft-dircolors-syntax*

The dircolors utility highlighting definition has one option.  It exists to
provide compatibility with the Slackware GNU/Linux distributions version of
the command.  It adds a few keywords that are generally ignored by most
versions.  On Slackware systems, however, the utility accepts the keywords and
uses them for processing.  To enable the Slackware keywords add the following
line to your startup file: >
	let dircolors_is_slackware = 1


DOCBOOK					*docbk.vim* *ft-docbk-syntax* *docbook*
DOCBOOK XML				*docbkxml.vim* *ft-docbkxml-syntax*
DOCBOOK SGML				*docbksgml.vim* *ft-docbksgml-syntax*

There are two types of DocBook files: SGML and XML.  To specify what type you
are using the "b:docbk_type" variable should be set.  Vim does this for you
automatically if it can recognize the type.  When Vim can't guess it the type
defaults to XML.
You can set the type manually: >
	:let docbk_type = "sgml"
or: >
	:let docbk_type = "xml"
You need to do this before loading the syntax file, which is complicated.
Simpler is setting the filetype to "docbkxml" or "docbksgml": >
	:set filetype=docbksgml
or: >
	:set filetype=docbkxml

You can specify the DocBook version: >
	:let docbk_ver = 3
When not set 4 is used.


DOSBATCH				*dosbatch.vim* *ft-dosbatch-syntax*

There is one option with highlighting DOS batch files.	This covers new
extensions to the Command Interpreter introduced with Windows 2000 and
is controlled by the variable dosbatch_cmdextversion.  For Windows NT
this should have the value 1, and for Windows 2000 it should be 2.
Select the version you want with the following line: >

   :let dosbatch_cmdextversion = 1

If this variable is not defined it defaults to a value of 2 to support
Windows 2000.

A second option covers whether *.btm files should be detected as type
"dosbatch" (MS-DOS batch files) or type "btm" (4DOS batch files).  The latter
is used by default.  You may select the former with the following line: >

   :let g:dosbatch_syntax_for_btm = 1

If this variable is undefined or zero, btm syntax is selected.


DOXYGEN						*doxygen.vim* *doxygen-syntax*

Doxygen generates code documentation using a special documentation format
(similar to Javadoc).  This syntax script adds doxygen highlighting to c, cpp,
idl and php files, and should also work with java.

There are a few of ways to turn on doxygen formatting. It can be done
explicitly or in a modeline by appending '.doxygen' to the syntax of the file.
Example: >
	:set syntax=c.doxygen
or >
	// vim:syntax=c.doxygen

It can also be done automatically for C, C++, C#, IDL and PHP files by setting
the global or buffer-local variable load_doxygen_syntax.  This is done by
adding the following to your .vimrc. >
	:let g:load_doxygen_syntax=1

There are a couple of variables that have an effect on syntax highlighting, and
are to do with non-standard highlighting options.

Variable			Default	Effect ~
g:doxygen_enhanced_color
g:doxygen_enhanced_colour	0	Use non-standard highlighting for
					doxygen comments.

doxygen_my_rendering		0	Disable rendering of HTML bold, italic
					and html_my_rendering underline.

doxygen_javadoc_autobrief	1	Set to 0 to disable javadoc autobrief
					colour highlighting.

doxygen_end_punctuation		'[.]'	Set to regexp match for the ending
					punctuation of brief

There are also some hilight groups worth mentioning as they can be useful in
configuration.

Highlight			Effect ~
doxygenErrorComment		The colour of an end-comment when missing
				punctuation in a code, verbatim or dot section
doxygenLinkError		The colour of an end-comment when missing the
				\endlink from a \link section.


DTD						*dtd.vim* *ft-dtd-syntax*

The DTD syntax highlighting is case sensitive by default.  To disable
case-sensitive highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let dtd_ignore_case=1

The DTD syntax file will highlight unknown tags as errors.  If
this is annoying, it can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_tag_errors=1

before sourcing the dtd.vim syntax file.
Parameter entity names are highlighted in the definition using the
'Type' highlighting group and 'Comment' for punctuation and '%'.
Parameter entity instances are highlighted using the 'Constant'
highlighting group and the 'Type' highlighting group for the
delimiters % and ;.  This can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_param_entities=1

The DTD syntax file is also included by xml.vim to highlight included dtd's.


EIFFEL					*eiffel.vim* *ft-eiffel-syntax*

While Eiffel is not case-sensitive, its style guidelines are, and the
syntax highlighting file encourages their use.  This also allows to
highlight class names differently.  If you want to disable case-sensitive
highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let eiffel_ignore_case=1

Case still matters for class names and TODO marks in comments.

Conversely, for even stricter checks, add one of the following lines: >

	:let eiffel_strict=1
	:let eiffel_pedantic=1

Setting eiffel_strict will only catch improper capitalization for the
five predefined words "Current", "Void", "Result", "Precursor", and
"NONE", to warn against their accidental use as feature or class names.

Setting eiffel_pedantic will enforce adherence to the Eiffel style
guidelines fairly rigorously (like arbitrary mixes of upper- and
lowercase letters as well as outdated ways to capitalize keywords).

If you want to use the lower-case version of "Current", "Void",
"Result", and "Precursor", you can use >

	:let eiffel_lower_case_predef=1

instead of completely turning case-sensitive highlighting off.

Support for ISE's proposed new creation syntax that is already
experimentally handled by some compilers can be enabled by: >

	:let eiffel_ise=1

Finally, some vendors support hexadecimal constants.  To handle them, add >

	:let eiffel_hex_constants=1

to your startup file.


EUPHORIA	    *euphoria3.vim* *euphoria4.vim* *ft-euphoria-syntax*

Two syntax highlighting files exists for Euphoria. One for Euphoria 
version 3.1.1, which is the default syntax highlighting file, and one for 
Euphoria version 4.0.5 or later.

Euphoria version 3.1.1 (http://www.rapideuphoria.com/) is still necessary 
for developing applications for the DOS platform, which Euphoria version 4 
(http://www.openeuphoria.org/) does not support.

The following file extensions are auto-detected as Euphoria file type: 
    
	*.e, *.eu, *.ew, *.ex, *.exu, *.exw
	*.E, *.EU, *.EW, *.EX, *.EXU, *.EXW

To select syntax highlighting file for Euphoria, as well as for 
auto-detecting the *.e and *.E file extensions as Euphoria file type,
add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria3"

	or 

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria4"


ERLANG						*erlang.vim* *ft-erlang-syntax*

Erlang is a functional programming language developed by Ericsson.  Files with
the following extensions are recognized as Erlang files: erl, hrl, yaws.

The BIFs (built-in functions) are highlighted by default. To disable this,
put the following line in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_bifs = 0

To enable highlighting some special atoms, put this in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_special_atoms = 1


FLEXWIKI				*flexwiki.vim* *ft-flexwiki-syntax*

FlexWiki is an ASP.NET-based wiki package available at http://www.flexwiki.com
NOTE: this site currently doesn't work, on Wikipedia is mentioned that
development stopped in 2009.

Syntax highlighting is available for the most common elements of FlexWiki
syntax. The associated ftplugin script sets some buffer-local options to make
editing FlexWiki pages more convenient. FlexWiki considers a newline as the
start of a new paragraph, so the ftplugin sets 'tw'=0 (unlimited line length),
'wrap' (wrap long lines instead of using horizontal scrolling), 'linebreak'
(to wrap at a character in 'breakat' instead of at the last char on screen),
and so on. It also includes some keymaps that are disabled by default.

If you want to enable the keymaps that make "j" and "k" and the cursor keys
move up and down by display lines, add this to your .vimrc: >
	:let flexwiki_maps = 1


FORM						*form.vim* *ft-form-syntax*

The coloring scheme for syntax elements in the FORM file uses the default
modes Conditional, Number, Statement, Comment, PreProc, Type, and String,
following the language specifications in 'Symbolic Manipulation with FORM' by
J.A.M. Vermaseren, CAN, Netherlands, 1991.

If you want include your own changes to the default colors, you have to
redefine the following syntax groups:

    - formConditional
    - formNumber
    - formStatement
    - formHeaderStatement
    - formComment
    - formPreProc
    - formDirective
    - formType
    - formString

Note that the form.vim syntax file implements FORM preprocessor commands and
directives per default in the same syntax group.

A predefined enhanced color mode for FORM is available to distinguish between
header statements and statements in the body of a FORM program.  To activate
this mode define the following variable in your vimrc file >

	:let form_enhanced_color=1

The enhanced mode also takes advantage of additional color features for a dark
gvim display.  Here, statements are colored LightYellow instead of Yellow, and
conditionals are LightBlue for better distinction.


FORTRAN					*fortran.vim* *ft-fortran-syntax*

Default highlighting and dialect ~
Highlighting appropriate for Fortran 2008 is used by default.  This choice
should be appropriate for most users most of the time because Fortran 2008 is
almost a superset of previous versions (Fortran 2003, 95, 90, and 77).

Fortran source code form ~
Fortran code can be in either fixed or free source form.  Note that the
syntax highlighting will not be correct if the form is incorrectly set.

When you create a new fortran file, the syntax script assumes fixed source
form.  If you always use free source form, then >
    :let fortran_free_source=1
in your .vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.  If you always use fixed source
form, then >
    :let fortran_fixed_source=1
in your .vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.

If the form of the source code depends upon the file extension, then it is
most convenient to set fortran_free_source in a ftplugin file.  For more
information on ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|.  For example, if all your
fortran files with an .f90 extension are written in free source form and the
rest in fixed source form, add the following code to your ftplugin file >
    let s:extfname = expand("%:e")
    if s:extfname ==? "f90"
	let fortran_free_source=1
	unlet! fortran_fixed_source
    else
	let fortran_fixed_source=1
	unlet! fortran_free_source
    endif
Note that this will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command
precedes the "syntax on" command in your .vimrc file.

When you edit an existing fortran file, the syntax script will assume free
source form if the fortran_free_source variable has been set, and assumes
fixed source form if the fortran_fixed_source variable has been set.  If
neither of these variables have been set, the syntax script attempts to
determine which source form has been used by examining the first five columns
of the first 250 lines of your file.  If no signs of free source form are
detected, then the file is assumed to be in fixed source form.  The algorithm
should work in the vast majority of cases.  In some cases, such as a file that
begins with 250 or more full-line comments, the script may incorrectly decide
that the fortran code is in fixed form.  If that happens, just add a
non-comment statement beginning anywhere in the first five columns of the
first twenty five lines, save (:w) and then reload (:e!) the file.

Tabs in fortran files ~
Tabs are not recognized by the Fortran standards.  Tabs are not a good idea in
fixed format fortran source code which requires fixed column boundaries.
Therefore, tabs are marked as errors.  Nevertheless, some programmers like
using tabs.  If your fortran files contain tabs, then you should set the
variable fortran_have_tabs in your .vimrc with a command such as >
    :let fortran_have_tabs=1
placed prior to the :syntax on command.  Unfortunately, the use of tabs will
mean that the syntax file will not be able to detect incorrect margins.

Syntax folding of fortran files ~
If you wish to use foldmethod=syntax, then you must first set the variable
fortran_fold with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold=1
to instruct the syntax script to define fold regions for program units, that
is main programs starting with a program statement, subroutines, function
subprograms, block data subprograms, interface blocks, and modules.  If you
also set the variable fortran_fold_conditionals with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_conditionals=1
then fold regions will also be defined for do loops, if blocks, and select
case constructs.  If you also set the variable
fortran_fold_multilinecomments with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_multilinecomments=1
then fold regions will also be defined for three or more consecutive comment
lines.  Note that defining fold regions can be slow for large files.

If fortran_fold, and possibly fortran_fold_conditionals and/or
fortran_fold_multilinecomments, have been set, then vim will fold your file if
you set foldmethod=syntax.  Comments or blank lines placed between two program
units are not folded because they are seen as not belonging to any program
unit.

More precise fortran syntax ~
If you set the variable fortran_more_precise with a command such as >
    :let fortran_more_precise=1
then the syntax coloring will be more precise but slower.  In particular,
statement labels used in do, goto and arithmetic if statements will be
recognized, as will construct names at the end of a do, if, select or forall
construct.

Non-default fortran dialects ~
The syntax script supports two Fortran dialects: f08 and F. You will probably
find the default highlighting (f08) satisfactory.  A few legacy constructs
deleted or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard are highlighted as todo
items.

If you use F, the advantage of setting the dialect appropriately is that
other legacy features excluded from F will be highlighted as todo items and
that free source form will be assumed.

The dialect can be selected in various ways.  If all your fortran files use
the same dialect, set the global variable fortran_dialect in your .vimrc prior
to your syntax on statement.  The case-sensitive, permissible values of
fortran_dialect are "f08" or "F".  Invalid values of fortran_dialect are
ignored.

If the dialect depends upon the file extension, then it is most convenient to
set a buffer-local variable in a ftplugin file.  For more information on
ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|.  For example, if all your fortran files with
an .f90 extension are written in the F subset, your ftplugin file should
contain the code >
    let s:extfname = expand("%:e")
    if s:extfname ==? "f90"
	let b:fortran_dialect="F"
    else
	unlet! b:fortran_dialect
    endif
Note that this will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command
precedes the "syntax on" command in your .vimrc file.

Finer control is necessary if the file extension does not uniquely identify
the dialect.  You can override the default dialect, on a file-by-file basis,
by including a comment with the directive "fortran_dialect=xx" (where xx=F or
f08) in one of the first three lines in your file.  For example, your older .f
files may be legacy code but your newer ones may be F codes, and you would
identify the latter by including in the first three lines of those files a
Fortran comment of the form >
  ! fortran_dialect=F

For previous versions of the syntax, you may have set fortran_dialect to the
now-obsolete values "f77", "f90", "f95", or "elf". Such settings will be
silently handled as "f08". Users of "elf" may wish to experiment with "F"
instead.

The syntax/fortran.vim script contains embedded comments that tell you how to
comment and/or uncomment some lines to (a) activate recognition of some
non-standard, vendor-supplied intrinsics and (b) to prevent features deleted
or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard from being highlighted as todo
items.

Limitations ~
Parenthesis checking does not catch too few closing parentheses.  Hollerith
strings are not recognized.  Some keywords may be highlighted incorrectly
because Fortran90 has no reserved words.

For further information related to fortran, see |ft-fortran-indent| and
|ft-fortran-plugin|.


FVWM CONFIGURATION FILES			*fvwm.vim* *ft-fvwm-syntax*

In order for Vim to recognize Fvwm configuration files that do not match
the patterns *fvwmrc* or *fvwm2rc* , you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your myfiletypes.vim file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:fvwm_version" to the major version
number of Fvwm, and the 'filetype' option to fvwm.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/X11/fvwm2/
as Fvwm2 configuration files, add the following: >

  :au! BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/X11/fvwm2/*  let b:fvwm_version = 2 |
					 \ set filetype=fvwm

If you'd like Vim to highlight all valid color names, tell it where to
find the color database (rgb.txt) on your system.  Do this by setting
"rgb_file" to its location.  Assuming your color database is located
in /usr/X11/lib/X11/, you should add the line >

	:let rgb_file = "/usr/X11/lib/X11/rgb.txt"

to your .vimrc file.


GSP						*gsp.vim* *ft-gsp-syntax*

The default coloring style for GSP pages is defined by |html.vim|, and
the coloring for java code (within java tags or inline between backticks)
is defined by |java.vim|.  The following HTML groups defined in |html.vim|
are redefined to incorporate and highlight inline java code:

    htmlString
    htmlValue
    htmlEndTag
    htmlTag
    htmlTagN

Highlighting should look fine most of the places where you'd see inline
java code, but in some special cases it may not.  To add another HTML
group where you will have inline java code where it does not highlight
correctly, just copy the line you want from |html.vim| and add gspJava
to the contains clause.

The backticks for inline java are highlighted according to the htmlError
group to make them easier to see.


GROFF						*groff.vim* *ft-groff-syntax*

The groff syntax file is a wrapper for |nroff.vim|, see the notes
under that heading for examples of use and configuration.  The purpose
of this wrapper is to set up groff syntax extensions by setting the
filetype from a |modeline| or in a personal filetype definitions file
(see |filetype.txt|).


HASKELL			     *haskell.vim* *lhaskell.vim* *ft-haskell-syntax*

The Haskell syntax files support plain Haskell code as well as literate
Haskell code, the latter in both Bird style and TeX style.  The Haskell
syntax highlighting will also highlight C preprocessor directives.

If you want to highlight delimiter characters (useful if you have a
light-coloured background), add to your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_delimiters = 1
To treat True and False as keywords as opposed to ordinary identifiers,
add: >
	:let hs_highlight_boolean = 1
To also treat the names of primitive types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_types = 1
And to treat the names of even more relatively common types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_more_types = 1
If you want to highlight the names of debugging functions, put in
your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_debug = 1

The Haskell syntax highlighting also highlights C preprocessor
directives, and flags lines that start with # but are not valid
directives as erroneous.  This interferes with Haskell's syntax for
operators, as they may start with #.  If you want to highlight those
as operators as opposed to errors, put in your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_allow_hash_operator = 1

The syntax highlighting for literate Haskell code will try to
automatically guess whether your literate Haskell code contains
TeX markup or not, and correspondingly highlight TeX constructs
or nothing at all.  You can override this globally by putting
in your .vimrc >
	:let lhs_markup = none
for no highlighting at all, or >
	:let lhs_markup = tex
to force the highlighting to always try to highlight TeX markup.
For more flexibility, you may also use buffer local versions of
this variable, so e.g. >
	:let b:lhs_markup = tex
will force TeX highlighting for a particular buffer.  It has to be
set before turning syntax highlighting on for the buffer or
loading a file.


HTML						*html.vim* *ft-html-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the HTML file works as follows.

The  <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are colored with the same color as the <> or </> respectively which
makes it easy to spot errors

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some HTML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the html.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <B> <I> <U> <EM> <STRONG> (<EM> is used as an alias for <I>,
while <STRONG> as an alias for <B>), <H1> - <H6>, <HEAD>, <TITLE> and <A>, but
only if used as a link (that is, it must include a href as in
<A href="somefile.html">).

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - htmlBold
    - htmlBoldUnderline
    - htmlBoldUnderlineItalic
    - htmlUnderline
    - htmlUnderlineItalic
    - htmlItalic
    - htmlTitle for titles
    - htmlH1 - htmlH6 for headings

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all with the exception
of the last two (htmlTitle and htmlH[1-6], which are optional) and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
	:let html_my_rendering=1

If you'd like to see an example download mysyntax.vim at
http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
	:let html_no_rendering=1

HTML comments are rather special (see an HTML reference document for the
details), and the syntax coloring scheme will highlight all errors.
However, if you prefer to use the wrong style (starts with <!-- and
ends with -->) you can define >
	:let html_wrong_comments=1

JavaScript and Visual Basic embedded inside HTML documents are highlighted as
'Special' with statements, comments, strings and so on colored as in standard
programming languages.  Note that only JavaScript and Visual Basic are currently
supported, no other scripting language has been added yet.

Embedded and inlined cascading style sheets (CSS) are highlighted too.

There are several html preprocessor languages out there.  html.vim has been
written such that it should be trivial to include it.  To do so add the
following two lines to the syntax coloring file for that language
(the example comes from the asp.vim file):

    runtime! syntax/html.vim
    syn cluster htmlPreproc add=asp

Now you just need to make sure that you add all regions that contain
the preprocessor language to the cluster htmlPreproc.


HTML/OS (by Aestiva)				*htmlos.vim* *ft-htmlos-syntax*

The coloring scheme for HTML/OS works as follows:

Functions and variable names are the same color by default, because VIM
doesn't specify different colors for Functions and Identifiers.  To change
this (which is recommended if you want function names to be recognizable in a
different color) you need to add the following line to either your ~/.vimrc: >
  :hi Function term=underline cterm=bold ctermfg=LightGray

Of course, the ctermfg can be a different color if you choose.

Another issues that HTML/OS runs into is that there is no special filetype to
signify that it is a file with HTML/OS coding.	You can change this by opening
a file and turning on HTML/OS syntax by doing the following: >
  :set syntax=htmlos

Lastly, it should be noted that the opening and closing characters to begin a
block of HTML/OS code can either be << or [[ and >> or ]], respectively.


IA64				*ia64.vim* *intel-itanium* *ft-ia64-syntax*

Highlighting for the Intel Itanium 64 assembly language.  See |asm.vim| for
how to recognize this filetype.

To have *.inc files be recognized as IA64, add this to your .vimrc file: >
	:let g:filetype_inc = "ia64"


INFORM						*inform.vim* *ft-inform-syntax*

Inform highlighting includes symbols provided by the Inform Library, as
most programs make extensive use of it.  If do not wish Library symbols
to be highlighted add this to your vim startup: >
	:let inform_highlight_simple=1

By default it is assumed that Inform programs are Z-machine targeted,
and highlights Z-machine assembly language symbols appropriately.  If
you intend your program to be targeted to a Glulx/Glk environment you
need to add this to your startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_glulx=1

This will highlight Glulx opcodes instead, and also adds glk() to the
set of highlighted system functions.

The Inform compiler will flag certain obsolete keywords as errors when
it encounters them.  These keywords are normally highlighted as errors
by Vim.  To prevent such error highlighting, you must add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_suppress_obsolete=1

By default, the language features highlighted conform to Compiler
version 6.30 and Library version 6.11.  If you are using an older
Inform development environment, you may with to add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_old=1

IDL							*idl.vim* *idl-syntax*

IDL (Interface Definition Language) files are used to define RPC calls.  In
Microsoft land, this is also used for defining COM interfaces and calls.

IDL's structure is simple enough to permit a full grammar based approach to
rather than using a few heuristics.  The result is large and somewhat
repetitive but seems to work.

There are some Microsoft extensions to idl files that are here.  Some of them
are disabled by defining idl_no_ms_extensions.

The more complex of the extensions are disabled by defining idl_no_extensions.

Variable			Effect ~

idl_no_ms_extensions		Disable some of the Microsoft specific
				extensions
idl_no_extensions		Disable complex extensions
idlsyntax_showerror		Show IDL errors (can be rather intrusive, but
				quite helpful)
idlsyntax_showerror_soft	Use softer colours by default for errors


JAVA						*java.vim* *ft-java-syntax*

The java.vim syntax highlighting file offers several options:

In Java 1.0.2 it was never possible to have braces inside parens, so this was
flagged as an error.  Since Java 1.1 this is possible (with anonymous
classes), and therefore is no longer marked as an error.  If you prefer the old
way, put the following line into your vim startup file: >
	:let java_mark_braces_in_parens_as_errors=1

All identifiers in java.lang.* are always visible in all classes.  To
highlight them use: >
	:let java_highlight_java_lang_ids=1

You can also highlight identifiers of most standard Java packages if you
download the javaid.vim script at http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html.
If you prefer to only highlight identifiers of a certain package, say java.io
use the following: >
	:let java_highlight_java_io=1
Check the javaid.vim file for a list of all the packages that are supported.

Function names are not highlighted, as the way to find functions depends on
how you write Java code.  The syntax file knows two possible ways to highlight
functions:

If you write function declarations that are always indented by either
a tab, 8 spaces or 2 spaces you may want to set >
	:let java_highlight_functions="indent"
However, if you follow the Java guidelines about how functions and classes are
supposed to be named (with respect to upper and lowercase), use >
	:let java_highlight_functions="style"
If both options do not work for you, but you would still want function
declarations to be highlighted create your own definitions by changing the
definitions in java.vim or by creating your own java.vim which includes the
original one and then adds the code to highlight functions.

In Java 1.1 the functions System.out.println() and System.err.println() should
only be used for debugging.  Therefore it is possible to highlight debugging
statements differently.  To do this you must add the following definition in
your startup file: >
	:let java_highlight_debug=1
The result will be that those statements are highlighted as 'Special'
characters.  If you prefer to have them highlighted differently you must define
new highlightings for the following groups.:
    Debug, DebugSpecial, DebugString, DebugBoolean, DebugType
which are used for the statement itself, special characters used in debug
strings, strings, boolean constants and types (this, super) respectively.  I
have opted to chose another background for those statements.

Javadoc is a program that takes special comments out of Java program files and
creates HTML pages.  The standard configuration will highlight this HTML code
similarly to HTML files (see |html.vim|).  You can even add Javascript
and CSS inside this code (see below).  There are four differences however:
  1. The title (all characters up to the first '.' which is followed by
     some white space or up to the first '@') is colored differently (to change
     the color change the group CommentTitle).
  2. The text is colored as 'Comment'.
  3. HTML comments are colored as 'Special'
  4. The special Javadoc tags (@see, @param, ...) are highlighted as specials
     and the argument (for @see, @param, @exception) as Function.
To turn this feature off add the following line to your startup file: >
	:let java_ignore_javadoc=1

If you use the special Javadoc comment highlighting described above you
can also turn on special highlighting for Javascript, visual basic
scripts and embedded CSS (stylesheets).  This makes only sense if you
actually have Javadoc comments that include either Javascript or embedded
CSS.  The options to use are >
	:let java_javascript=1
	:let java_css=1
	:let java_vb=1

In order to highlight nested parens with different colors define colors
for javaParen, javaParen1 and javaParen2, for example with >
	:hi link javaParen Comment
or >
	:hi javaParen ctermfg=blue guifg=#0000ff

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "java_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let java_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.


LACE						*lace.vim* *ft-lace-syntax*

Lace (Language for Assembly of Classes in Eiffel) is case insensitive, but the
style guide lines are not.  If you prefer case insensitive highlighting, just
define the vim variable 'lace_case_insensitive' in your startup file: >
	:let lace_case_insensitive=1


LEX						*lex.vim* *ft-lex-syntax*

Lex uses brute-force synchronizing as the "^%%$" section delimiter
gives no clue as to what section follows.  Consequently, the value for >
	:syn sync minlines=300
may be changed by the user if s/he is experiencing synchronization
difficulties (such as may happen with large lex files).


LIFELINES				*lifelines.vim* *ft-lifelines-syntax*

To highlight deprecated functions as errors, add in your .vimrc: >

	:let g:lifelines_deprecated = 1
<

LISP						*lisp.vim* *ft-lisp-syntax*

The lisp syntax highlighting provides two options: >

	g:lisp_instring : if it exists, then "(...)" strings are highlighted
			  as if the contents of the string were lisp.
			  Useful for AutoLisp.
	g:lisp_rainbow  : if it exists and is nonzero, then differing levels
			  of parenthesization will receive different
			  highlighting.
<
The g:lisp_rainbow option provides 10 levels of individual colorization for
the parentheses and backquoted parentheses.  Because of the quantity of
colorization levels, unlike non-rainbow highlighting, the rainbow mode
specifies its highlighting using ctermfg and guifg, thereby bypassing the
usual colorscheme control using standard highlighting groups.  The actual
highlighting used depends on the dark/bright setting  (see |'bg'|).


LITE						*lite.vim* *ft-lite-syntax*

There are two options for the lite syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let lite_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "lite_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let lite_minlines = 200


LPC						*lpc.vim* *ft-lpc-syntax*

LPC stands for a simple, memory-efficient language: Lars Pensj| C.  The
file name of LPC is usually *.c.  Recognizing these files as LPC would bother
users writing only C programs.	If you want to use LPC syntax in Vim, you
should set a variable in your .vimrc file: >

	:let lpc_syntax_for_c = 1

If it doesn't work properly for some particular C or LPC files, use a
modeline.  For a LPC file:

	// vim:set ft=lpc:

For a C file that is recognized as LPC:

	// vim:set ft=c:

If you don't want to set the variable, use the modeline in EVERY LPC file.

There are several implementations for LPC, we intend to support most widely
used ones.  Here the default LPC syntax is for MudOS series, for MudOS v22
and before, you should turn off the sensible modifiers, and this will also
assert the new efuns after v22 to be invalid, don't set this variable when
you are using the latest version of MudOS: >

	:let lpc_pre_v22 = 1

For LpMud 3.2 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_compat_32 = 1

For LPC4 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_use_lpc4_syntax = 1

For uLPC series of LPC:
uLPC has been developed to Pike, so you should use Pike syntax
instead, and the name of your source file should be *.pike


LUA						*lua.vim* *ft-lua-syntax*

The Lua syntax file can be used for versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 (5.2 is
the default). You can select one of these versions using the global variables
lua_version and lua_subversion. For example, to activate Lua
5.1 syntax highlighting, set the variables like this:

	:let lua_version = 5
	:let lua_subversion = 1


MAIL						*mail.vim* *ft-mail.vim*

Vim highlights all the standard elements of an email (headers, signatures,
quoted text and URLs / email addresses).  In keeping with standard conventions,
signatures begin in a line containing only "--" followed optionally by
whitespaces and end with a newline.

Vim treats lines beginning with ']', '}', '|', '>' or a word followed by '>'
as quoted text.  However Vim highlights headers and signatures in quoted text
only if the text is quoted with '>' (optionally followed by one space).

By default mail.vim synchronises syntax to 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you have a slow machine, and generally deal with emails
with short headers, you can change this to a smaller value: >

    :let mail_minlines = 30


MAKE						*make.vim* *ft-make-syntax*

In makefiles, commands are usually highlighted to make it easy for you to spot
errors.  However, this may be too much coloring for you.  You can turn this
feature off by using: >

	:let make_no_commands = 1


MAPLE						*maple.vim* *ft-maple-syntax*

Maple V, by Waterloo Maple Inc, supports symbolic algebra.  The language
supports many packages of functions which are selectively loaded by the user.
The standard set of packages' functions as supplied in Maple V release 4 may be
highlighted at the user's discretion.  Users may place in their .vimrc file: >

	:let mvpkg_all= 1

to get all package functions highlighted, or users may select any subset by
choosing a variable/package from the table below and setting that variable to
1, also in their .vimrc file (prior to sourcing
$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim).

	Table of Maple V Package Function Selectors >
  mv_DEtools	 mv_genfunc	mv_networks	mv_process
  mv_Galois	 mv_geometry	mv_numapprox	mv_simplex
  mv_GaussInt	 mv_grobner	mv_numtheory	mv_stats
  mv_LREtools	 mv_group	mv_orthopoly	mv_student
  mv_combinat	 mv_inttrans	mv_padic	mv_sumtools
  mv_combstruct mv_liesymm	mv_plots	mv_tensor
  mv_difforms	 mv_linalg	mv_plottools	mv_totorder
  mv_finance	 mv_logic	mv_powseries


MATHEMATICA		*mma.vim* *ft-mma-syntax* *ft-mathematica-syntax*

Empty *.m files will automatically be presumed to be Matlab files unless you
have the following in your .vimrc: >

	let filetype_m = "mma"


MOO						*moo.vim* *ft-moo-syntax*

If you use C-style comments inside expressions and find it mangles your
highlighting, you may want to use extended (slow!) matches for C-style
comments: >

	:let moo_extended_cstyle_comments = 1

To disable highlighting of pronoun substitution patterns inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_pronoun_sub = 1

To disable highlighting of the regular expression operator '%|', and matching
'%(' and '%)' inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_regexp = 1

Unmatched double quotes can be recognized and highlighted as errors: >

	:let moo_unmatched_quotes = 1

To highlight builtin properties (.name, .location, .programmer etc.): >

	:let moo_builtin_properties = 1

Unknown builtin functions can be recognized and highlighted as errors.  If you
use this option, add your own extensions to the mooKnownBuiltinFunction group.
To enable this option: >

	:let moo_unknown_builtin_functions = 1

An example of adding sprintf() to the list of known builtin functions: >

	:syn keyword mooKnownBuiltinFunction sprintf contained


MSQL						*msql.vim* *ft-msql-syntax*

There are two options for the msql syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let msql_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "msql_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let msql_minlines = 200


NCF						*ncf.vim* *ft-ncf-syntax*

There is one option for NCF syntax highlighting.

If you want to have unrecognized (by ncf.vim) statements highlighted as
errors, use this: >

	:let ncf_highlight_unknowns = 1

If you don't want to highlight these errors, leave it unset.


NROFF						*nroff.vim* *ft-nroff-syntax*

The nroff syntax file works with AT&T n/troff out of the box.  You need to
activate the GNU groff extra features included in the syntax file before you
can use them.

For example, Linux and BSD distributions use groff as their default text
processing package.  In order to activate the extra syntax highlighting
features for groff, add the following option to your start-up files: >

  :let b:nroff_is_groff = 1

Groff is different from the old AT&T n/troff that you may still find in
Solaris.  Groff macro and request names can be longer than 2 characters and
there are extensions to the language primitives.  For example, in AT&T troff
you access the year as a 2-digit number with the request \(yr.  In groff you
can use the same request, recognized for compatibility, or you can use groff's
native syntax, \[yr].  Furthermore, you can use a 4-digit year directly:
\[year].  Macro requests can be longer than 2 characters, for example, GNU mm
accepts the requests ".VERBON" and ".VERBOFF" for creating verbatim
environments.

In order to obtain the best formatted output g/troff can give you, you should
follow a few simple rules about spacing and punctuation.

1. Do not leave empty spaces at the end of lines.

2. Leave one space and one space only after an end-of-sentence period,
   exclamation mark, etc.

3. For reasons stated below, it is best to follow all period marks with a
   carriage return.

The reason behind these unusual tips is that g/n/troff have a line breaking
algorithm that can be easily upset if you don't follow the rules given above.

Unlike TeX, troff fills text line-by-line, not paragraph-by-paragraph and,
furthermore, it does not have a concept of glue or stretch, all horizontal and
vertical space input will be output as is.

Therefore, you should be careful about not using more space between sentences
than you intend to have in your final document.  For this reason, the common
practice is to insert a carriage return immediately after all punctuation
marks.  If you want to have "even" text in your final processed output, you
need to maintain regular spacing in the input text.  To mark both trailing
spaces and two or more spaces after a punctuation as an error, use: >

  :let nroff_space_errors = 1

Another technique to detect extra spacing and other errors that will interfere
with the correct typesetting of your file, is to define an eye-catching
highlighting definition for the syntax groups "nroffDefinition" and
"nroffDefSpecial" in your configuration files.  For example: >

  hi def nroffDefinition term=italic cterm=italic gui=reverse
  hi def nroffDefSpecial term=italic,bold cterm=italic,bold
			 \ gui=reverse,bold

If you want to navigate preprocessor entries in your source file as easily as
with section markers, you can activate the following option in your .vimrc
file: >

	let b:preprocs_as_sections = 1

As well, the syntax file adds an extra paragraph marker for the extended
paragraph macro (.XP) in the ms package.

Finally, there is a |groff.vim| syntax file that can be used for enabling
groff syntax highlighting either on a file basis or globally by default.


OCAML						*ocaml.vim* *ft-ocaml-syntax*

The OCaml syntax file handles files having the following prefixes: .ml,
.mli, .mll and .mly.  By setting the following variable >

	:let ocaml_revised = 1

you can switch from standard OCaml-syntax to revised syntax as supported
by the camlp4 preprocessor.  Setting the variable >

	:let ocaml_noend_error = 1

prevents highlighting of "end" as error, which is useful when sources
contain very long structures that Vim does not synchronize anymore.


PAPP						*papp.vim* *ft-papp-syntax*

The PApp syntax file handles .papp files and, to a lesser extend, .pxml
and .pxsl files which are all a mixture of perl/xml/html/other using xml
as the top-level file format.  By default everything inside phtml or pxml
sections is treated as a string with embedded preprocessor commands.  If
you set the variable: >

	:let papp_include_html=1

in your startup file it will try to syntax-hilight html code inside phtml
sections, but this is relatively slow and much too colourful to be able to
edit sensibly. ;)

The newest version of the papp.vim syntax file can usually be found at
http://papp.plan9.de.


PASCAL						*pascal.vim* *ft-pascal-syntax*

Files matching "*.p" could be Progress or Pascal.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >

   :let filetype_p = "pascal"

The Pascal syntax file has been extended to take into account some extensions
provided by Turbo Pascal, Free Pascal Compiler and GNU Pascal Compiler.
Delphi keywords are also supported.  By default, Turbo Pascal 7.0 features are
enabled.  If you prefer to stick with the standard Pascal keywords, add the
following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_traditional=1

To switch on Delphi specific constructions (such as one-line comments,
keywords, etc): >

   :let pascal_delphi=1


The option pascal_symbol_operator controls whether symbol operators such as +,
*, .., etc. are displayed using the Operator color or not.  To colorize symbol
operators, add the following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_symbol_operator=1

Some functions are highlighted by default.  To switch it off: >

   :let pascal_no_functions=1

Furthermore, there are specific variables for some compilers.  Besides
pascal_delphi, there are pascal_gpc and pascal_fpc.  Default extensions try to
match Turbo Pascal. >

   :let pascal_gpc=1

or >

   :let pascal_fpc=1

To ensure that strings are defined on a single line, you can define the
pascal_one_line_string variable. >

   :let pascal_one_line_string=1

If you dislike <Tab> chars, you can set the pascal_no_tabs variable.  Tabs
will be highlighted as Error. >

   :let pascal_no_tabs=1



PERL						*perl.vim* *ft-perl-syntax*

There are a number of possible options to the perl syntax highlighting.

Inline POD highlighting is now turned on by default.  If you don't wish
to have the added complexity of highlighting POD embedded within Perl
files, you may set the 'perl_include_pod' option to 0: >

	:let perl_include_pod = 0

To reduce the complexity of parsing (and increase performance) you can switch
off two elements in the parsing of variable names and contents. >

To handle package references in variable and function names not differently
from the rest of the name (like 'PkgName::' in '$PkgName::VarName'): >

	:let perl_no_scope_in_variables = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_want_scope_in_variables"
enabled it.)

If you do not want complex things like '@{${"foo"}}' to be parsed: >

	:let perl_no_extended_vars = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_extended_vars" enabled it.)

The coloring strings can be changed.  By default strings and qq friends will be
highlighted like the first line.  If you set the variable
perl_string_as_statement, it will be highlighted as in the second line.

   "hello world!"; qq|hello world|;
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^NN^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^N	  (unlet perl_string_as_statement)
   S^^^^^^^^^^^^SNNSSS^^^^^^^^^^^SN	  (let perl_string_as_statement)

(^ = perlString, S = perlStatement, N = None at all)

The syncing has 3 options.  The first two switch off some triggering of
synchronization and should only be needed in case it fails to work properly.
If while scrolling all of a sudden the whole screen changes color completely
then you should try and switch off one of those.  Let me know if you can figure
out the line that causes the mistake.

One triggers on "^\s*sub\s*" and the other on "^[$@%]" more or less. >

	:let perl_no_sync_on_sub
	:let perl_no_sync_on_global_var

Below you can set the maximum distance VIM should look for starting points for
its attempts in syntax highlighting. >

	:let perl_sync_dist = 100

If you want to use folding with perl, set perl_fold: >

	:let perl_fold = 1

If you want to fold blocks in if statements, etc. as well set the following: >

	:let perl_fold_blocks = 1

Subroutines are folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  If you do not want
this, you can set 'perl_nofold_subs': >

	:let perl_nofold_subs = 1

Anonymous subroutines are not folded by default; you may enable their folding
via 'perl_fold_anonymous_subs': >

	:let perl_fold_anonymous_subs = 1

Packages are also folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  To disable this
behavior, set 'perl_nofold_packages': >

	:let perl_nofold_packages = 1

PHP3 and PHP4		*php.vim* *php3.vim* *ft-php-syntax* *ft-php3-syntax*

[note: previously this was called "php3", but since it now also supports php4
it has been renamed to "php"]

There are the following options for the php syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings: >

  let php_sql_query = 1

For highlighting the Baselib methods: >

  let php_baselib = 1

Enable HTML syntax highlighting inside strings: >

  let php_htmlInStrings = 1

Using the old colorstyle: >

  let php_oldStyle = 1

Enable highlighting ASP-style short tags: >

  let php_asp_tags = 1

Disable short tags: >

  let php_noShortTags = 1

For highlighting parent error ] or ): >

  let php_parent_error_close = 1

For skipping a php end tag, if there exists an open ( or [ without a closing
one: >

  let php_parent_error_open = 1

Enable folding for classes and functions: >

  let php_folding = 1

Selecting syncing method: >

  let php_sync_method = x

x = -1 to sync by search (default),
x > 0 to sync at least x lines backwards,
x = 0 to sync from start.


PLAINTEX				*plaintex.vim* *ft-plaintex-syntax*

TeX is a typesetting language, and plaintex is the file type for the "plain"
variant of TeX.  If you never want your *.tex files recognized as plain TeX,
see |ft-tex-plugin|.

This syntax file has the option >

	let g:plaintex_delimiters = 1

if you want to highlight brackets "[]" and braces "{}".


PPWIZARD					*ppwiz.vim* *ft-ppwiz-syntax*

PPWizard is a preprocessor for HTML and OS/2 INF files

This syntax file has the options:

- ppwiz_highlight_defs : determines highlighting mode for PPWizard's
  definitions.  Possible values are

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 1 : PPWizard #define statements retain the
    colors of their contents (e.g. PPWizard macros and variables)

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 2 : preprocessor #define and #evaluate
    statements are shown in a single color with the exception of line
    continuation symbols

  The default setting for ppwiz_highlight_defs is 1.

- ppwiz_with_html : If the value is 1 (the default), highlight literal
  HTML code; if 0, treat HTML code like ordinary text.


PHTML						*phtml.vim* *ft-phtml-syntax*

There are two options for the phtml syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let phtml_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "phtml_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let phtml_minlines = 200


POSTSCRIPT				*postscr.vim* *ft-postscr-syntax*

There are several options when it comes to highlighting PostScript.

First which version of the PostScript language to highlight.  There are
currently three defined language versions, or levels.  Level 1 is the original
and base version, and includes all extensions prior to the release of level 2.
Level 2 is the most common version around, and includes its own set of
extensions prior to the release of level 3.  Level 3 is currently the highest
level supported.  You select which level of the PostScript language you want
highlighted by defining the postscr_level variable as follows: >

	:let postscr_level=2

If this variable is not defined it defaults to 2 (level 2) since this is
the most prevalent version currently.

Note, not all PS interpreters will support all language features for a
particular language level.  In particular the %!PS-Adobe-3.0 at the start of
PS files does NOT mean the PostScript present is level 3 PostScript!

If you are working with Display PostScript, you can include highlighting of
Display PS language features by defining the postscr_display variable as
follows: >

	:let postscr_display=1

If you are working with Ghostscript, you can include highlighting of
Ghostscript specific language features by defining the variable
postscr_ghostscript as follows: >

	:let postscr_ghostscript=1

PostScript is a large language, with many predefined elements.	While it
useful to have all these elements highlighted, on slower machines this can
cause Vim to slow down.  In an attempt to be machine friendly font names and
character encodings are not highlighted by default.  Unless you are working
explicitly with either of these this should be ok.  If you want them to be
highlighted you should set one or both of the following variables: >

	:let postscr_fonts=1
	:let postscr_encodings=1

There is a stylistic option to the highlighting of and, or, and not.  In
PostScript the function of these operators depends on the types of their
operands - if the operands are booleans then they are the logical operators,
if they are integers then they are binary operators.  As binary and logical
operators can be highlighted differently they have to be highlighted one way
or the other.  By default they are treated as logical operators.  They can be
highlighted as binary operators by defining the variable
postscr_andornot_binary as follows: >

	:let postscr_andornot_binary=1
<

			*ptcap.vim* *ft-printcap-syntax*
PRINTCAP + TERMCAP	*ft-ptcap-syntax* *ft-termcap-syntax*

This syntax file applies to the printcap and termcap databases.

In order for Vim to recognize printcap/termcap files that do not match
the patterns *printcap*, or *termcap*, you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your |myfiletypefile| file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:ptcap_type" to either "print" or
"term", and then the 'filetype' option to ptcap.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/termcaps/ as termcap
files, add the following: >

   :au BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/termcaps/* let b:ptcap_type = "term" |
				       \ set filetype=ptcap

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which
are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "ptcap_minlines"
internal variable to a larger number: >

   :let ptcap_minlines = 50

(The default is 20 lines.)


PROGRESS				*progress.vim* *ft-progress-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit cweb at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "progress"
The same happens for "*.i", which could be assembly, and "*.p", which could be
Pascal.  Use this if you don't use assembly and Pascal: >
   :let filetype_i = "progress"
   :let filetype_p = "progress"


PYTHON						*python.vim* *ft-python-syntax*

There are six options to control Python syntax highlighting.

For highlighted numbers: >
	:let python_no_number_highlight = 1

For highlighted builtin functions: >
	:let python_no_builtin_highlight = 1

For highlighted standard exceptions: >
	:let python_no_exception_highlight = 1

For highlighted doctests and code inside: >
	:let python_no_doctest_highlight = 1
or >
	:let python_no_doctest_code_highlight = 1
(first option implies second one).

For highlighted trailing whitespace and mix of spaces and tabs: >
	:let python_space_error_highlight = 1

If you want all possible Python highlighting (the same as setting the
preceding last option and unsetting all other ones): >
	:let python_highlight_all = 1

Note: only existence of these options matter, not their value. You can replace
      1 above with anything.


QUAKE						*quake.vim* *ft-quake-syntax*

The Quake syntax definition should work for most any FPS (First Person
Shooter) based on one of the Quake engines.  However, the command names vary
a bit between the three games (Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena) so the
syntax definition checks for the existence of three global variables to allow
users to specify what commands are legal in their files.  The three variables
can be set for the following effects:

set to highlight commands only available in Quake: >
	:let quake_is_quake1 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 2: >
	:let quake_is_quake2 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 3 Arena: >
	:let quake_is_quake3 = 1

Any combination of these three variables is legal, but might highlight more
commands than are actually available to you by the game.


READLINE				*readline.vim* *ft-readline-syntax*

The readline library is primarily used by the BASH shell, which adds quite a
few commands and options to the ones already available.  To highlight these
items as well you can add the following to your |vimrc| or just type it in the
command line before loading a file with the readline syntax: >
	let readline_has_bash = 1

This will add highlighting for the commands that BASH (version 2.05a and
later, and part earlier) adds.


RESTRUCTURED TEXT			*rst.vim* *ft-rst-syntax*

You may set what syntax definitions should be used for code blocks via
	let rst_syntax_code_list = ['vim', 'lisp', ...]


REXX						*rexx.vim* *ft-rexx-syntax*

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "rexx_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let rexx_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

Vim tries to guess what type a ".r" file is.  If it can't be detected (from
comment lines), the default is "r".  To make the default rexx add this line to
your .vimrc:  *g:filetype_r*
>
	:let g:filetype_r = "r"


RUBY						*ruby.vim* *ft-ruby-syntax*

There are a number of options to the Ruby syntax highlighting.

By default, the "end" keyword is colorized according to the opening statement
of the block it closes.  While useful, this feature can be expensive; if you
experience slow redrawing (or you are on a terminal with poor color support)
you may want to turn it off by defining the "ruby_no_expensive" variable: >

	:let ruby_no_expensive = 1
<
In this case the same color will be used for all control keywords.

If you do want this feature enabled, but notice highlighting errors while
scrolling backwards, which are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting
the "ruby_minlines" variable to a value larger than 50: >

	:let ruby_minlines = 100
<
Ideally, this value should be a number of lines large enough to embrace your
largest class or module.

Highlighting of special identifiers can be disabled by removing the
rubyIdentifier highlighting: >

	:hi link rubyIdentifier NONE
<
This will prevent highlighting of special identifiers like "ConstantName",
"$global_var", "@@class_var", "@instance_var", "| block_param |", and
":symbol".

Significant methods of Kernel, Module and Object are highlighted by default.
This can be disabled by defining "ruby_no_special_methods": >

	:let ruby_no_special_methods = 1
<
This will prevent highlighting of important methods such as "require", "attr",
"private", "raise" and "proc".

Ruby operators can be highlighted. This is enabled by defining
"ruby_operators": >

	:let ruby_operators = 1
<
Whitespace errors can be highlighted by defining "ruby_space_errors": >

	:let ruby_space_errors = 1
<
This will highlight trailing whitespace and tabs preceded by a space character
as errors.  This can be refined by defining "ruby_no_trail_space_error" and
"ruby_no_tab_space_error" which will ignore trailing whitespace and tabs after
spaces respectively.

Folding can be enabled by defining "ruby_fold": >

	:let ruby_fold = 1
<
This will set the 'foldmethod' option to "syntax" and allow folding of
classes, modules, methods, code blocks, heredocs and comments.

Folding of multiline comments can be disabled by defining
"ruby_no_comment_fold": >

	:let ruby_no_comment_fold = 1
<

SCHEME						*scheme.vim* *ft-scheme-syntax*

By default only R5RS keywords are highlighted and properly indented.

MzScheme-specific stuff will be used if b:is_mzscheme or g:is_mzscheme
variables are defined.

Also scheme.vim supports keywords of the Chicken Scheme->C compiler.  Define
b:is_chicken or g:is_chicken, if you need them.


SDL						*sdl.vim* *ft-sdl-syntax*

The SDL highlighting probably misses a few keywords, but SDL has so many
of them it's almost impossibly to cope.

The new standard, SDL-2000, specifies that all identifiers are
case-sensitive (which was not so before), and that all keywords can be
used either completely lowercase or completely uppercase.  To have the
highlighting reflect this, you can set the following variable: >
	:let sdl_2000=1

This also sets many new keywords.  If you want to disable the old
keywords, which is probably a good idea, use: >
	:let SDL_no_96=1


The indentation is probably also incomplete, but right now I am very
satisfied with it for my own projects.


SED						*sed.vim* *ft-sed-syntax*

To make tabs stand out from regular blanks (accomplished by using Todo
highlighting on the tabs), define "highlight_sedtabs" by putting >

	:let highlight_sedtabs = 1

in the vimrc file.  (This special highlighting only applies for tabs
inside search patterns, replacement texts, addresses or text included
by an Append/Change/Insert command.)  If you enable this option, it is
also a good idea to set the tab width to one character; by doing that,
you can easily count the number of tabs in a string.

Bugs:

  The transform command (y) is treated exactly like the substitute
  command.  This means that, as far as this syntax file is concerned,
  transform accepts the same flags as substitute, which is wrong.
  (Transform accepts no flags.)  I tolerate this bug because the
  involved commands need very complex treatment (95 patterns, one for
  each plausible pattern delimiter).


SGML						*sgml.vim* *ft-sgml-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the SGML file works as follows.

The <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are not colored which makes it easy to spot errors.

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some SGML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the sgml.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <varname> <emphasis> <command> <function> <literal>
<replaceable> <ulink> and <link>.

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - sgmlBold
    - sgmlBoldItalic
    - sgmlUnderline
    - sgmlItalic
    - sgmlLink for links

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
   let sgml_my_rendering=1

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
   let sgml_no_rendering=1

(Adapted from the html.vim help text by Claudio Fleiner <claudio@fleiner.com>)


SH		*sh.vim* *ft-sh-syntax* *ft-bash-syntax* *ft-ksh-syntax*

This covers the "normal" Unix (Bourne) sh, bash and the Korn shell.

Vim attempts to determine which shell type is in use by specifying that
various filenames are of specific types: >

    ksh : .kshrc* *.ksh
    bash: .bashrc* bashrc bash.bashrc .bash_profile* *.bash
<
If none of these cases pertain, then the first line of the file is examined
(ex. /bin/sh  /bin/ksh	/bin/bash).  If the first line specifies a shelltype,
then that shelltype is used.  However some files (ex. .profile) are known to
be shell files but the type is not apparent.  Furthermore, on many systems
sh is symbolically linked to "bash" (Linux, Windows+cygwin) or "ksh" (Posix).

One may specify a global default by instantiating one of the following three
variables in your <.vimrc>:

    ksh: >
	let g:is_kornshell = 1
<   posix: (using this is the same as setting is_kornshell to 1) >
	let g:is_posix     = 1
<   bash: >
	let g:is_bash	   = 1
<   sh: (default) Bourne shell >
	let g:is_sh	   = 1

If there's no "#! ..." line, and the user hasn't availed himself/herself of a
default sh.vim syntax setting as just shown, then syntax/sh.vim will assume
the Bourne shell syntax.  No need to quote RFCs or market penetration
statistics in error reports, please -- just select the default version of the
sh your system uses in your <.vimrc>.

The syntax/sh.vim file provides several levels of syntax-based folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 0     (default, no syntax folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 1     (enable function folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 2     (enable heredoc folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 4     (enable if/do/for folding)
>
then various syntax items (HereDocuments and function bodies) become
syntax-foldable (see |:syn-fold|).  You also may add these together
to get multiple types of folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 3     (enables function and heredoc folding)

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards which are fixed
when one redraws with CTRL-L, try setting the "sh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number.  Example: >

	let sh_minlines = 500

This will make syntax synchronization start 500 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 200.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

If you don't have much to synchronize on, displaying can be very slow.	To
reduce this, the "sh_maxlines" internal variable can be set.  Example: >

	let sh_maxlines = 100
<
The default is to use the twice sh_minlines.  Set it to a smaller number to
speed up displaying.  The disadvantage is that highlight errors may appear.

						*g:sh_isk* *g:sh_noisk*
The shell languages appear to let "." be part of words, commands, etc;
consequently it should be in the isk for sh.vim.  As of v116 of syntax/sh.vim,
syntax/sh.vim will append the "." to |'iskeyword'| by default; you may control
this behavior with: >
	let g:sh_isk  = '..whatever characters you want as part of iskeyword'
	let g:sh_noisk= 1  " otherwise, if this exists, the isk will NOT chg
<
						*sh-embed*  *sh-awk*
 Sh: EMBEDDING LANGUAGES~

You may wish to embed languages into sh.  I'll give an example courtesy of
Lorance Stinson on how to do this with awk as an example. Put the following
file into $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/sh/awkembed.vim: >

    " AWK Embedding: {{{1
    " ==============
    " Shamelessly ripped from aspperl.vim by Aaron Hope.
    if exists("b:current_syntax")

    hi def link AWKCommand Type
<
This code will then let the awk code in the single quotes: >
	awk '...awk code here...'
be highlighted using the awk highlighting syntax.  Clearly this may be
extended to other languages.


SPEEDUP						*spup.vim* *ft-spup-syntax*
(AspenTech plant simulator)

The Speedup syntax file has some options:

- strict_subsections : If this variable is defined, only keywords for
  sections and subsections will be highlighted as statements but not
  other keywords (like WITHIN in the OPERATION section).

- highlight_types : Definition of this variable causes stream types
  like temperature or pressure to be highlighted as Type, not as a
  plain Identifier.  Included are the types that are usually found in
  the DECLARE section; if you defined own types, you have to include
  them in the syntax file.

- oneline_comments : this value ranges from 1 to 3 and determines the
  highlighting of # style comments.

  oneline_comments = 1 : allow normal Speedup code after an even
  number of #s.

  oneline_comments = 2 : show code starting with the second # as
  error.  This is the default setting.

  oneline_comments = 3 : show the whole line as error if it contains
  more than one #.

Since especially OPERATION sections tend to become very large due to
PRESETting variables, syncing may be critical.  If your computer is
fast enough, you can increase minlines and/or maxlines near the end of
the syntax file.


SQL						*sql.vim* *ft-sql-syntax*
				*sqlinformix.vim* *ft-sqlinformix-syntax*
				*sqlanywhere.vim* *ft-sqlanywhere-syntax*

While there is an ANSI standard for SQL, most database engines add their own
custom extensions.  Vim currently supports the Oracle and Informix dialects of
SQL.  Vim assumes "*.sql" files are Oracle SQL by default.

Vim currently has SQL support for a variety of different vendors via syntax
scripts.  You can change Vim's default from Oracle to any of the current SQL
supported types.  You can also easily alter the SQL dialect being used on a
buffer by buffer basis.

For more detailed instructions see |ft_sql.txt|.


TCSH						*tcsh.vim* *ft-tcsh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "tcsh".  It is a superset of csh.  See |csh.vim|
for how the filetype is detected.

Tcsh does not allow \" in strings unless the "backslash_quote" shell variable
is set.  If you want VIM to assume that no backslash quote constructs exist add
this line to your .vimrc: >

	:let tcsh_backslash_quote = 0

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "tcsh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >

	:let tcsh_minlines = 1000

This will make the syntax synchronization start 1000 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you set "tcsh_minlines" to "fromstart", then
synchronization is done from the start of the file. The default value for
tcsh_minlines is 100.  The disadvantage of using a larger number is that
redrawing can become slow.

				*tex-folding* *g:tex_fold_enabled*
 Tex: Want Syntax Folding? ~

As of version 28 of <syntax/tex.vim>, syntax-based folding of parts, chapters,
sections, subsections, etc are supported.  Put >
	let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
in your <.vimrc>, and :set fdm=syntax.  I suggest doing the latter via a
modeline at the end of your LaTeX file: >
	% vim: fdm=syntax
If your system becomes too slow, then you might wish to look into >
	https://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html#faq-29.7
<
						*g:tex_nospell*
 Tex: No Spell Checking Wanted~

If you don't want spell checking anywhere in your LaTeX document, put >
	let g:tex_nospell=1
into your .vimrc.  If you merely wish to suppress spell checking inside
comments only, see |g:tex_comment_nospell|.

				*tex-nospell* *g:tex_comment_nospell*
 Tex: Don't Want Spell Checking In Comments? ~

Some folks like to include things like source code in comments and so would
prefer that spell checking be disabled in comments in LaTeX files.  To do
this, put the following in your <.vimrc>: >
      let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1
If you want to suppress spell checking everywhere inside your LaTeX document,
see |g:tex_nospell|.

				*tex-verb* *g:tex_verbspell*
 Tex: Want Spell Checking in Verbatim Zones?~

Often verbatim regions are used for things like source code; seldom does
one want source code spell-checked.  However, for those of you who do
want your verbatim zones spell-checked, put the following in your <.vimrc>: >
	let g:tex_verbspell= 1
<
					*tex-runon* *tex-stopzone*
 Tex: Run-on Comments or MathZones ~

The <syntax/tex.vim> highlighting supports TeX, LaTeX, and some AmsTeX.  The
highlighting supports three primary zones/regions: normal, texZone, and
texMathZone.  Although considerable effort has been made to have these zones
terminate properly, zones delineated by $..$ and $$..$$ cannot be synchronized
as there's no difference between start and end patterns.  Consequently, a
special "TeX comment" has been provided >
	%stopzone
which will forcibly terminate the highlighting of either a texZone or a
texMathZone.

					*tex-slow* *tex-sync*
 Tex: Slow Syntax Highlighting? ~

If you have a slow computer, you may wish to reduce the values for >
	:syn sync maxlines=200
	:syn sync minlines=50
(especially the latter).  If your computer is fast, you may wish to
increase them.	This primarily affects synchronizing (i.e. just what group,
if any, is the text at the top of the screen supposed to be in?).

Another cause of slow highlighting is due to syntax-driven folding; see
|tex-folding| for a way around this.

					*g:tex_fast*

Finally, if syntax highlighting is still too slow, you may set >

	:let g:tex_fast= ""

in your .vimrc.  Used this way, the g:tex_fast variable causes the syntax
highlighting script to avoid defining any regions and associated
synchronization.  The result will be much faster syntax highlighting; the
price: you will no longer have as much highlighting or any syntax-based
folding, and you will be missing syntax-based error checking.

You may decide that some syntax is acceptable; you may use the following table
selectively to enable just some syntax highlighting: >

    b : allow bold and italic syntax
    c : allow texComment syntax
    m : allow texMatcher syntax (ie. {...} and [...])
    M : allow texMath syntax
    p : allow parts, chapter, section, etc syntax
    r : allow texRefZone syntax (nocite, bibliography, label, pageref, eqref)
    s : allow superscript/subscript regions
    S : allow texStyle syntax
    v : allow verbatim syntax
    V : allow texNewEnv and texNewCmd syntax
<
As an example, let g:tex_fast= "M" will allow math-associated highlighting
but suppress all the other region-based syntax highlighting.
(also see: |g:tex_conceal| and |tex-supersub|)

					*tex-morecommands* *tex-package*
 Tex: Want To Highlight More Commands? ~

LaTeX is a programmable language, and so there are thousands of packages full
of specialized LaTeX commands, syntax, and fonts.  If you're using such a
package you'll often wish that the distributed syntax/tex.vim would support
it.  However, clearly this is impractical.  So please consider using the
techniques in |mysyntaxfile-add| to extend or modify the highlighting provided
by syntax/tex.vim.  Please consider uploading any extensions that you write,
which typically would go in $HOME/after/syntax/tex/[pkgname].vim, to
http://vim.sf.net/.

					*tex-error* *g:tex_no_error*
 Tex: Excessive Error Highlighting? ~

The <tex.vim> supports lexical error checking of various sorts.  Thus,
although the error checking is ofttimes very useful, it can indicate
errors where none actually are.  If this proves to be a problem for you,
you may put in your <.vimrc> the following statement: >
	let g:tex_no_error=1
and all error checking by <syntax/tex.vim> will be suppressed.

								*tex-math*
 Tex: Need a new Math Group? ~

If you want to include a new math group in your LaTeX, the following
code shows you an example as to how you might do so: >
	call TexNewMathZone(sfx,mathzone,starform)
You'll want to provide the new math group with a unique suffix
(currently, A-L and V-Z are taken by <syntax/tex.vim> itself).
As an example, consider how eqnarray is set up by <syntax/tex.vim>: >
	call TexNewMathZone("D","eqnarray",1)
You'll need to change "mathzone" to the name of your new math group,
and then to the call to it in .vim/after/syntax/tex.vim.
The "starform" variable, if true, implies that your new math group
has a starred form (ie. eqnarray*).

					*tex-style* *b:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Starting a New Style? ~

One may use "\makeatletter" in *.tex files, thereby making the use of "@" in
commands available.  However, since the *.tex file doesn't have one of the
following suffices: sty cls clo dtx ltx, the syntax highlighting will flag
such use of @ as an error.  To solve this: >

	:let b:tex_stylish = 1
	:set ft=tex

Putting "let g:tex_stylish=1" into your <.vimrc> will make <syntax/tex.vim>
always accept such use of @.

					*tex-cchar* *tex-cole* *tex-conceal*
 Tex: Taking Advantage of Conceal Mode~

If you have |'conceallevel'| set to 2 and if your encoding is utf-8, then a
number of character sequences can be translated into appropriate utf-8 glyphs,
including various accented characters, Greek characters in MathZones, and
superscripts and subscripts in MathZones.  Not all characters can be made into
superscripts or subscripts; the constraint is due to what utf-8 supports.
In fact, only a few characters are supported as subscripts.

One way to use this is to have vertically split windows (see |CTRL-W_v|); one
with |'conceallevel'| at 0 and the other at 2; and both using |'scrollbind'|.

					*g:tex_conceal*
 Tex: Selective Conceal Mode~

You may selectively use conceal mode by setting g:tex_conceal in your
<.vimrc>.  By default, g:tex_conceal is set to "admgs" to enable concealment
for the following sets of characters: >

	a = accents/ligatures
	b = bold and italic
	d = delimiters
	m = math symbols
	g = Greek
	s = superscripts/subscripts
<
By leaving one or more of these out, the associated conceal-character
substitution will not be made.

						*g:tex_isk* *g:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Controlling iskeyword~

Normally, LaTeX keywords support 0-9, a-z, A-z, and 192-255 only. Latex
keywords don't support the underscore - except when in *.sty files.  The
syntax highlighting script handles this with the following logic:

	* If g:tex_stylish exists and is 1
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)
	* Else if the file's suffix is sty, cls, clo, dtx, or ltx,
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)

	* If g:tex_isk exists, then it will be used for the local 'iskeyword'
	* Else the local 'iskeyword' will be set to 48-57,a-z,A-Z,192-255

			*tex-supersub* *g:tex_superscripts* *g:tex_subscripts*
 Tex: Fine Subscript and Superscript Control~

	See |tex-conceal| for how to enable concealed character replacement.

	See |g:tex_conceal| for selectively concealing accents, bold/italic,
	math, Greek, and superscripts/subscripts.

	One may exert fine control over which superscripts and subscripts one
	wants syntax-based concealment for (see |:syn-cchar|).  Since not all
	fonts support all characters, one may override the
	concealed-replacement lists; by default these lists are given by: >

	    let g:tex_superscripts= "[0-9a-zA-W.,:;+-<>/()=]"
	    let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aehijklmnoprstuvx,+-/().]"
<
	For example, I use Luxi Mono Bold; it doesn't support subscript
	characters for "hklmnpst", so I put >
		let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aeijoruvx,+-/().]"
<	in ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/tex.vim in order to avoid having inscrutable
	utf-8 glyphs appear.


TF						*tf.vim* *ft-tf-syntax*

There is one option for the tf syntax highlighting.

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "tf_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let tf_minlines = your choice
<
VIM			*vim.vim*		*ft-vim-syntax*
			*g:vimsyn_minlines*	*g:vimsyn_maxlines*
There is a trade-off between more accurate syntax highlighting versus screen
updating speed.  To improve accuracy, you may wish to increase the
g:vimsyn_minlines variable.  The g:vimsyn_maxlines variable may be used to
improve screen updating rates (see |:syn-sync| for more on this). >

	g:vimsyn_minlines : used to set synchronization minlines
	g:vimsyn_maxlines : used to set synchronization maxlines
<
	(g:vim_minlines and g:vim_maxlines are deprecated variants of
	these two options)

						*g:vimsyn_embed*
The g:vimsyn_embed option allows users to select what, if any, types of
embedded script highlighting they wish to have. >

   g:vimsyn_embed == 0   : don't embed any scripts
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'm' : support embedded mzscheme
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'p' : support embedded perl
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'P' : support embedded python
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'r' : support embedded ruby
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 't' : support embedded tcl
<
By default, g:vimsyn_embed is a string supporting interpreters that your vim
itself supports.  Concatenate multiple characters to support multiple types
of embedded interpreters; ie. g:vimsyn_embed= "mp" supports embedded mzscheme
and embedded perl.
						*g:vimsyn_folding*

Some folding is now supported with syntax/vim.vim: >

   g:vimsyn_folding == 0 or doesn't exist: no syntax-based folding
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'a' : augroups
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'f' : fold functions
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'm' : fold mzscheme script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'p' : fold perl     script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'P' : fold python   script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'r' : fold ruby     script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 't' : fold tcl      script
<
							*g:vimsyn_noerror*
Not all error highlighting that syntax/vim.vim does may be correct; VimL is a
difficult language to highlight correctly.  A way to suppress error
highlighting is to put the following line in your |vimrc|: >

	let g:vimsyn_noerror = 1
<


XF86CONFIG				*xf86conf.vim* *ft-xf86conf-syntax*

The syntax of XF86Config file differs in XFree86 v3.x and v4.x.  Both
variants are supported.  Automatic detection is used, but is far from perfect.
You may need to specify the version manually.  Set the variable
xf86conf_xfree86_version to 3 or 4 according to your XFree86 version in
your .vimrc.  Example: >
	:let xf86conf_xfree86_version=3
When using a mix of versions, set the b:xf86conf_xfree86_version variable.

Note that spaces and underscores in option names are not supported.  Use
"SyncOnGreen" instead of "__s yn con gr_e_e_n" if you want the option name
highlighted.


XML						*xml.vim* *ft-xml-syntax*

Xml namespaces are highlighted by default.  This can be inhibited by
setting a global variable: >

	:let g:xml_namespace_transparent=1
<
							*xml-folding*
The xml syntax file provides syntax |folding| (see |:syn-fold|) between
start and end tags.  This can be turned on by >

	:let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
	:set foldmethod=syntax

Note: syntax folding might slow down syntax highlighting significantly,
especially for large files.


X Pixmaps (XPM)					*xpm.vim* *ft-xpm-syntax*

xpm.vim creates its syntax items dynamically based upon the contents of the
XPM file.  Thus if you make changes e.g. in the color specification strings,
you have to source it again e.g. with ":set syn=xpm".

To copy a pixel with one of the colors, yank a "pixel" with "yl" and insert it
somewhere else with "P".

Do you want to draw with the mouse?  Try the following: >
   :function! GetPixel()
   :   let c = getline(".")[col(".") - 1]
   :   echo c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftMouse> <LeftMouse>r".c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftDrag>	<LeftMouse>r".c
   :endfunction
   :noremap <RightMouse> <LeftMouse>:call GetPixel()<CR>
   :set guicursor=n:hor20	   " to see the color beneath the cursor
This turns the right button into a pipette and the left button into a pen.
It will work with XPM files that have one character per pixel only and you
must not click outside of the pixel strings, but feel free to improve it.

It will look much better with a font in a quadratic cell size, e.g. for X: >
	:set guifont=-*-clean-medium-r-*-*-8-*-*-*-*-80-*

==============================================================================
5. Defining a syntax					*:syn-define* *E410*

Vim understands three types of syntax items:

1. Keyword
   It can only contain keyword characters, according to the 'iskeyword'
   option.  It cannot contain other syntax items.  It will only match with a
   complete word (there are no keyword characters before or after the match).
   The keyword "if" would match in "if(a=b)", but not in "ifdef x", because
   "(" is not a keyword character and "d" is.

2. Match
   This is a match with a single regexp pattern.

3. Region
   This starts at a match of the "start" regexp pattern and ends with a match
   with the "end" regexp pattern.  Any other text can appear in between.  A
   "skip" regexp pattern can be used to avoid matching the "end" pattern.

Several syntax ITEMs can be put into one syntax GROUP.	For a syntax group
you can give highlighting attributes.  For example, you could have an item
to define a "/* .. */" comment and another one that defines a "// .." comment,
and put them both in the "Comment" group.  You can then specify that a
"Comment" will be in bold font and have a blue color.  You are free to make
one highlight group for one syntax item, or put all items into one group.
This depends on how you want to specify your highlighting attributes.  Putting
each item in its own group results in having to specify the highlighting
for a lot of groups.

Note that a syntax group and a highlight group are similar.  For a highlight
group you will have given highlight attributes.  These attributes will be used
for the syntax group with the same name.

In case more than one item matches at the same position, the one that was
defined LAST wins.  Thus you can override previously defined syntax items by
using an item that matches the same text.  But a keyword always goes before a
match or region.  And a keyword with matching case always goes before a
keyword with ignoring case.


PRIORITY						*:syn-priority*

When several syntax items may match, these rules are used:

1. When multiple Match or Region items start in the same position, the item
   defined last has priority.
2. A Keyword has priority over Match and Region items.
3. An item that starts in an earlier position has priority over items that
   start in later positions.


DEFINING CASE						*:syn-case* *E390*

:sy[ntax] case [match | ignore]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will work with
	matching case, when using "match", or with ignoring case, when using
	"ignore".  Note that any items before this are not affected, and all
	items until the next ":syntax case" command are affected.


SPELL CHECKING						*:syn-spell*

:sy[ntax] spell [toplevel | notoplevel | default]
	This defines where spell checking is to be done for text that is not
	in a syntax item:

	toplevel:	Text is spell checked.
	notoplevel:	Text is not spell checked.
	default:	When there is a @Spell cluster no spell checking.

	For text in syntax items use the @Spell and @NoSpell clusters
	|spell-syntax|.  When there is no @Spell and no @NoSpell cluster then
	spell checking is done for "default" and "toplevel".

	To activate spell checking the 'spell' option must be set.


DEFINING KEYWORDS					*:syn-keyword*

:sy[ntax] keyword {group-name} [{options}] {keyword} .. [{options}]

	This defines a number of keywords.

	{group-name}	Is a syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]	See |:syn-arguments| below.
	{keyword} ..	Is a list of keywords which are part of this group.

	Example: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char
<
	The {options} can be given anywhere in the line.  They will apply to
	all keywords given, also for options that come after a keyword.
	These examples do exactly the same: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   contained int long char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long contained char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char contained
<								*E789*
	When you have a keyword with an optional tail, like Ex commands in
	Vim, you can put the optional characters inside [], to define all the
	variations at once: >
  :syntax keyword   vimCommand	 ab[breviate] n[ext]
<
	Don't forget that a keyword can only be recognized if all the
	characters are included in the 'iskeyword' option.  If one character
	isn't, the keyword will never be recognized.
	Multi-byte characters can also be used.  These do not have to be in
	'iskeyword'.

	A keyword always has higher priority than a match or region, the
	keyword is used if more than one item matches.	Keywords do not nest
	and a keyword can't contain anything else.

	Note that when you have a keyword that is the same as an option (even
	one that isn't allowed here), you can not use it.  Use a match
	instead.

	The maximum length of a keyword is 80 characters.

	The same keyword can be defined multiple times, when its containment
	differs.  For example, you can define the keyword once not contained
	and use one highlight group, and once contained, and use a different
	highlight group.  Example: >
  :syn keyword vimCommand tag
  :syn keyword vimSetting contained tag
<	When finding "tag" outside of any syntax item, the "vimCommand"
	highlight group is used.  When finding "tag" in a syntax item that
	contains "vimSetting", the "vimSetting" group is used.


DEFINING MATCHES					*:syn-match*

:sy[ntax] match {group-name} [{options}] [excludenl] {pattern} [{options}]

	This defines one match.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[excludenl]		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or region.  Must be
				given before the pattern. |:syn-excludenl|
	{pattern}		The search pattern that defines the match.
				See |:syn-pattern| below.
				Note that the pattern may match more than one
				line, which makes the match depend on where
				Vim starts searching for the pattern.  You
				need to make sure syncing takes care of this.

	Example (match a character constant): >
  :syntax match Character /'.'/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<

DEFINING REGIONS	*:syn-region* *:syn-start* *:syn-skip* *:syn-end*
							*E398* *E399*
:sy[ntax] region {group-name} [{options}]
		[matchgroup={group-name}]
		[keepend]
		[extend]
		[excludenl]
		start={start_pattern} ..
		[skip={skip_pattern}]
		end={end_pattern} ..
		[{options}]

	This defines one region.  It may span several lines.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[matchgroup={group-name}]  The syntax group to use for the following
				start or end pattern matches only.  Not used
				for the text in between the matched start and
				end patterns.  Use NONE to reset to not using
				a different group for the start or end match.
				See |:syn-matchgroup|.
	keepend			Don't allow contained matches to go past a
				match with the end pattern.  See
				|:syn-keepend|.
	extend			Override a "keepend" for an item this region
				is contained in.  See |:syn-extend|.
	excludenl		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or item.  Only
				useful for end patterns.  Must be given before
				the patterns it applies to. |:syn-excludenl|
	start={start_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the start of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	skip={skip_pattern}	The search pattern that defines text inside
				the region where not to look for the end
				pattern.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	end={end_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the end of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.

	Example: >
  :syntax region String   start=+"+  skip=+\\"+  end=+"+
<
	The start/skip/end patterns and the options can be given in any order.
	There can be zero or one skip pattern.	There must be one or more
	start and end patterns.  This means that you can omit the skip
	pattern, but you must give at least one start and one end pattern.  It
	is allowed to have white space before and after the equal sign
	(although it mostly looks better without white space).

	When more than one start pattern is given, a match with one of these
	is sufficient.	This means there is an OR relation between the start
	patterns.  The last one that matches is used.  The same is true for
	the end patterns.

	The search for the end pattern starts right after the start pattern.
	Offsets are not used for this.	This implies that the match for the
	end pattern will never overlap with the start pattern.

	The skip and end pattern can match across line breaks, but since the
	search for the pattern can start in any line it often does not do what
	you want.  The skip pattern doesn't avoid a match of an end pattern in
	the next line.	Use single-line patterns to avoid trouble.

	Note: The decision to start a region is only based on a matching start
	pattern.  There is no check for a matching end pattern.  This does NOT
	work: >
		:syn region First  start="("  end=":"
		:syn region Second start="("  end=";"
<	The Second always matches before the First (last defined pattern has
	higher priority).  The Second region then continues until the next
	';', no matter if there is a ':' before it.  Using a match does work: >
		:syn match First  "(\_.\{-}:"
		:syn match Second "(\_.\{-};"
<	This pattern matches any character or line break with "\_." and
	repeats that with "\{-}" (repeat as few as possible).

							*:syn-keepend*
	By default, a contained match can obscure a match for the end pattern.
	This is useful for nesting.  For example, a region that starts with
	"{" and ends with "}", can contain another region.  An encountered "}"
	will then end the contained region, but not the outer region:
	    {		starts outer "{}" region
		{	starts contained "{}" region
		}	ends contained "{}" region
	    }		ends outer "{} region
	If you don't want this, the "keepend" argument will make the matching
	of an end pattern of the outer region also end any contained item.
	This makes it impossible to nest the same region, but allows for
	contained items to highlight parts of the end pattern, without causing
	that to skip the match with the end pattern.  Example: >
  :syn match  vimComment +"[^"]\+$+
  :syn region vimCommand start="set" end="$" contains=vimComment keepend
<	The "keepend" makes the vimCommand always end at the end of the line,
	even though the contained vimComment includes a match with the <EOL>.

	When "keepend" is not used, a match with an end pattern is retried
	after each contained match.  When "keepend" is included, the first
	encountered match with an end pattern is used, truncating any
	contained matches.
							*:syn-extend*
	The "keepend" behavior can be changed by using the "extend" argument.
	When an item with "extend" is contained in an item that uses
	"keepend", the "keepend" is ignored and the containing region will be
	extended.
	This can be used to have some contained items extend a region while
	others don't.  Example: >

   :syn region htmlRef start=+<a>+ end=+</a>+ keepend contains=htmlItem,htmlScript
   :syn match htmlItem +<[^>]*>+ contained
   :syn region htmlScript start=+<script+ end=+</script[^>]*>+ contained extend

<	Here the htmlItem item does not make the htmlRef item continue
	further, it is only used to highlight the <> items.  The htmlScript
	item does extend the htmlRef item.

	Another example: >
   :syn region xmlFold start="<a>" end="</a>" fold transparent keepend extend
<	This defines a region with "keepend", so that its end cannot be
	changed by contained items, like when the "</a>" is matched to
	highlight it differently.  But when the xmlFold region is nested (it
	includes itself), the "extend" applies, so that the "</a>" of a nested
	region only ends that region, and not the one it is contained in.

							*:syn-excludenl*
	When a pattern for a match or end pattern of a region includes a '$'
	to match the end-of-line, it will make a region item that it is
	contained in continue on the next line.  For example, a match with
	"\\$" (backslash at the end of the line) can make a region continue
	that would normally stop at the end of the line.  This is the default
	behavior.  If this is not wanted, there are two ways to avoid it:
	1. Use "keepend" for the containing item.  This will keep all
	   contained matches from extending the match or region.  It can be
	   used when all contained items must not extend the containing item.
	2. Use "excludenl" in the contained item.  This will keep that match
	   from extending the containing match or region.  It can be used if
	   only some contained items must not extend the containing item.
	   "excludenl" must be given before the pattern it applies to.

							*:syn-matchgroup*
	"matchgroup" can be used to highlight the start and/or end pattern
	differently than the body of the region.  Example: >
  :syntax region String matchgroup=Quote start=+"+  skip=+\\"+	end=+"+
<	This will highlight the quotes with the "Quote" group, and the text in
	between with the "String" group.
	The "matchgroup" is used for all start and end patterns that follow,
	until the next "matchgroup".  Use "matchgroup=NONE" to go back to not
	using a matchgroup.

	In a start or end pattern that is highlighted with "matchgroup" the
	contained items of the region are not used.  This can be used to avoid
	that a contained item matches in the start or end pattern match.  When
	using "transparent", this does not apply to a start or end pattern
	match that is highlighted with "matchgroup".

	Here is an example, which highlights three levels of parentheses in
	different colors: >
   :sy region par1 matchgroup=par1 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par2
   :sy region par2 matchgroup=par2 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par3 contained
   :sy region par3 matchgroup=par3 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par1 contained
   :hi par1 ctermfg=red guifg=red
   :hi par2 ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
   :hi par3 ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
<
						*E849*
The maximum number of syntax groups is 19999.

==============================================================================
6. :syntax arguments					*:syn-arguments*

The :syntax commands that define syntax items take a number of arguments.
The common ones are explained here.  The arguments may be given in any order
and may be mixed with patterns.

Not all commands accept all arguments.	This table shows which arguments
can not be used for all commands:
							*E395*
		    contains  oneline	fold  display  extend concealends~
:syntax keyword		 -	 -	 -	 -	 -      -
:syntax match		yes	 -	yes	yes	yes     -
:syntax region		yes	yes	yes	yes	yes    yes

These arguments can be used for all three commands:
	conceal
	cchar
	contained
	containedin
	nextgroup
	transparent
	skipwhite
	skipnl
	skipempty

conceal						*conceal* *:syn-conceal*

When the "conceal" argument is given, the item is marked as concealable.
Whether or not it is actually concealed depends on the value of the
'conceallevel' option.  The 'concealcursor' option is used to decide whether
concealable items in the current line are displayed unconcealed to be able to
edit the line.

concealends						*:syn-concealends*

When the "concealends" argument is given, the start and end matches of
the region, but not the contents of the region, are marked as concealable.
Whether or not they are actually concealed depends on the setting on the
'conceallevel' option. The ends of a region can only be concealed separately
in this way when they have their own highlighting via "matchgroup"

cchar							*:syn-cchar*
							*E844*
The "cchar" argument defines the character shown in place of the item
when it is concealed (setting "cchar" only makes sense when the conceal
argument is given.) If "cchar" is not set then the default conceal
character defined in the 'listchars' option is used.  The character cannot be
a control character such as Tab.  Example: >
   :syntax match Entity "&amp;" conceal cchar=&
See |hl-Conceal| for highlighting.

contained						*:syn-contained*

When the "contained" argument is given, this item will not be recognized at
the top level, but only when it is mentioned in the "contains" field of
another match.	Example: >
   :syntax keyword Todo    TODO    contained
   :syntax match   Comment "//.*"  contains=Todo


display							*:syn-display*

If the "display" argument is given, this item will be skipped when the
detected highlighting will not be displayed.  This will speed up highlighting,
by skipping this item when only finding the syntax state for the text that is
to be displayed.

Generally, you can use "display" for match and region items that meet these
conditions:
- The item does not continue past the end of a line.  Example for C: A region
  for a "/*" comment can't contain "display", because it continues on the next
  line.
- The item does not contain items that continue past the end of the line or
  make it continue on the next line.
- The item does not change the size of any item it is contained in.  Example
  for C: A match with "\\$" in a preprocessor match can't have "display",
  because it may make that preprocessor match shorter.
- The item does not allow other items to match that didn't match otherwise,
  and that item may extend the match too far.  Example for C: A match for a
  "//" comment can't use "display", because a "/*" inside that comment would
  match then and start a comment which extends past the end of the line.

Examples, for the C language, where "display" can be used:
- match with a number
- match with a label


transparent						*:syn-transparent*

If the "transparent" argument is given, this item will not be highlighted
itself, but will take the highlighting of the item it is contained in.	This
is useful for syntax items that don't need any highlighting but are used
only to skip over a part of the text.

The "contains=" argument is also inherited from the item it is contained in,
unless a "contains" argument is given for the transparent item itself.	To
avoid that unwanted items are contained, use "contains=NONE".  Example, which
highlights words in strings, but makes an exception for "vim": >
	:syn match myString /'[^']*'/ contains=myWord,myVim
	:syn match myWord   /\<[a-z]*\>/ contained
	:syn match myVim    /\<vim\>/ transparent contained contains=NONE
	:hi link myString String
	:hi link myWord   Comment
Since the "myVim" match comes after "myWord" it is the preferred match (last
match in the same position overrules an earlier one).  The "transparent"
argument makes the "myVim" match use the same highlighting as "myString".  But
it does not contain anything.  If the "contains=NONE" argument would be left
out, then "myVim" would use the contains argument from myString and allow
"myWord" to be contained, which will be highlighted as a Constant.  This
happens because a contained match doesn't match inside itself in the same
position, thus the "myVim" match doesn't overrule the "myWord" match here.

When you look at the colored text, it is like looking at layers of contained
items.	The contained item is on top of the item it is contained in, thus you
see the contained item.  When a contained item is transparent, you can look
through, thus you see the item it is contained in.  In a picture:

		look from here

	    |	|   |	|   |	|
	    V	V   V	V   V	V

	       xxxx	  yyy		more contained items
	    ....................	contained item (transparent)
	=============================	first item

The 'x', 'y' and '=' represent a highlighted syntax item.  The '.' represent a
transparent group.

What you see is:

	=======xxxx=======yyy========

Thus you look through the transparent "....".


oneline							*:syn-oneline*

The "oneline" argument indicates that the region does not cross a line
boundary.  It must match completely in the current line.  However, when the
region has a contained item that does cross a line boundary, it continues on
the next line anyway.  A contained item can be used to recognize a line
continuation pattern.  But the "end" pattern must still match in the first
line, otherwise the region doesn't even start.

When the start pattern includes a "\n" to match an end-of-line, the end
pattern must be found in the same line as where the start pattern ends.  The
end pattern may also include an end-of-line.  Thus the "oneline" argument
means that the end of the start pattern and the start of the end pattern must
be within one line.  This can't be changed by a skip pattern that matches a
line break.


fold							*:syn-fold*

The "fold" argument makes the fold level increase by one for this item.
Example: >
   :syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold
   :syn sync fromstart
   :set foldmethod=syntax
This will make each {} block form one fold.

The fold will start on the line where the item starts, and end where the item
ends.  If the start and end are within the same line, there is no fold.
The 'foldnestmax' option limits the nesting of syntax folds.
{not available when Vim was compiled without |+folding| feature}


			*:syn-contains* *E405* *E406* *E407* *E408* *E409*
contains={group-name},..

The "contains" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  These
groups will be allowed to begin inside the item (they may extend past the
containing group's end).  This allows for recursive nesting of matches and
regions.  If there is no "contains" argument, no groups will be contained in
this item.  The group names do not need to be defined before they can be used
here.

contains=ALL
		If the only item in the contains list is "ALL", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item.

contains=ALLBUT,{group-name},..
		If the first item in the contains list is "ALLBUT", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item, except the ones that
		are listed.  Example: >
  :syntax region Block start="{" end="}" ... contains=ALLBUT,Function

contains=TOP
		If the first item in the contains list is "TOP", then all
		groups will be accepted that don't have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=TOP,{group-name},..
		Like "TOP", but excluding the groups that are listed.

contains=CONTAINED
		If the first item in the contains list is "CONTAINED", then
		all groups will be accepted that have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=CONTAINED,{group-name},..
		Like "CONTAINED", but excluding the groups that are
		listed.


The {group-name} in the "contains" list can be a pattern.  All group names
that match the pattern will be included (or excluded, if "ALLBUT" is used).
The pattern cannot contain white space or a ','.  Example: >
   ... contains=Comment.*,Keyw[0-3]
The matching will be done at moment the syntax command is executed.  Groups
that are defined later will not be matched.  Also, if the current syntax
command defines a new group, it is not matched.  Be careful: When putting
syntax commands in a file you can't rely on groups NOT being defined, because
the file may have been sourced before, and ":syn clear" doesn't remove the
group names.

The contained groups will also match in the start and end patterns of a
region.  If this is not wanted, the "matchgroup" argument can be used
|:syn-matchgroup|.  The "ms=" and "me=" offsets can be used to change the
region where contained items do match.	Note that this may also limit the
area that is highlighted


containedin={group-name}...				*:syn-containedin*

The "containedin" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  The
item will be allowed to begin inside these groups.  This works as if the
containing item has a "contains=" argument that includes this item.

The {group-name}... can be used just like for "contains", as explained above.

This is useful when adding a syntax item afterwards.  An item can be told to
be included inside an already existing item, without changing the definition
of that item.  For example, to highlight a word in a C comment after loading
the C syntax: >
	:syn keyword myword HELP containedin=cComment contained
Note that "contained" is also used, to avoid that the item matches at the top
level.

Matches for "containedin" are added to the other places where the item can
appear.  A "contains" argument may also be added as usual.  Don't forget that
keywords never contain another item, thus adding them to "containedin" won't
work.


nextgroup={group-name},..				*:syn-nextgroup*

The "nextgroup" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names,
separated by commas (just like with "contains", so you can also use patterns).

If the "nextgroup" argument is given, the mentioned syntax groups will be
tried for a match, after the match or region ends.  If none of the groups have
a match, highlighting continues normally.  If there is a match, this group
will be used, even when it is not mentioned in the "contains" field of the
current group.	This is like giving the mentioned group priority over all
other groups.  Example: >
   :syntax match  ccFoobar  "Foo.\{-}Bar"  contains=ccFoo
   :syntax match  ccFoo     "Foo"	    contained nextgroup=ccFiller
   :syntax region ccFiller  start="."  matchgroup=ccBar  end="Bar"  contained

This will highlight "Foo" and "Bar" differently, and only when there is a
"Bar" after "Foo".  In the text line below, "f" shows where ccFoo is used for
highlighting, and "bbb" where ccBar is used. >

   Foo asdfasd Bar asdf Foo asdf Bar asdf
   fff	       bbb	fff	 bbb

Note the use of ".\{-}" to skip as little as possible until the next Bar.
when ".*" would be used, the "asdf" in between "Bar" and "Foo" would be
highlighted according to the "ccFoobar" group, because the ccFooBar match
would include the first "Foo" and the last "Bar" in the line (see |pattern|).


skipwhite						*:syn-skipwhite*
skipnl							*:syn-skipnl*
skipempty						*:syn-skipempty*

These arguments are only used in combination with "nextgroup".	They can be
used to allow the next group to match after skipping some text:
	skipwhite	skip over space and tab characters
	skipnl		skip over the end of a line
	skipempty	skip over empty lines (implies a "skipnl")

When "skipwhite" is present, the white space is only skipped if there is no
next group that matches the white space.

When "skipnl" is present, the match with nextgroup may be found in the next
line.  This only happens when the current item ends at the end of the current
line!  When "skipnl" is not present, the nextgroup will only be found after
the current item in the same line.

When skipping text while looking for a next group, the matches for other
groups are ignored.  Only when no next group matches, other items are tried
for a match again.  This means that matching a next group and skipping white
space and <EOL>s has a higher priority than other items.

Example: >
  :syn match ifstart "\<if.*"	  nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty
  :syn match ifline  "[^ \t].*" nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty contained
  :syn match ifline  "endif"	contained
Note that the "[^ \t].*" match matches all non-white text.  Thus it would also
match "endif".	Therefore the "endif" match is put last, so that it takes
precedence.
Note that this example doesn't work for nested "if"s.  You need to add
"contains" arguments to make that work (omitted for simplicity of the
example).

IMPLICIT CONCEAL					*:syn-conceal-implicit*

:sy[ntax] conceal [on|off]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will define keywords,
	matches or regions with the "conceal" flag set. After ":syn conceal
	on", all subsequent ":syn keyword", ":syn match" or ":syn region"
	defined will have the "conceal" flag set implicitly. ":syn conceal
	off" returns to the normal state where the "conceal" flag must be
	given explicitly.

==============================================================================
7. Syntax patterns				*:syn-pattern* *E401* *E402*

In the syntax commands, a pattern must be surrounded by two identical
characters.  This is like it works for the ":s" command.  The most common to
use is the double quote.  But if the pattern contains a double quote, you can
use another character that is not used in the pattern.	Examples: >
  :syntax region Comment  start="/\*"  end="\*/"
  :syntax region String   start=+"+    end=+"+	 skip=+\\"+

See |pattern| for the explanation of what a pattern is.  Syntax patterns are
always interpreted like the 'magic' option is set, no matter what the actual
value of 'magic' is.  And the patterns are interpreted like the 'l' flag is
not included in 'cpoptions'.  This was done to make syntax files portable and
independent of 'compatible' and 'magic' settings.

Try to avoid patterns that can match an empty string, such as "[a-z]*".
This slows down the highlighting a lot, because it matches everywhere.

						*:syn-pattern-offset*
The pattern can be followed by a character offset.  This can be used to
change the highlighted part, and to change the text area included in the
match or region (which only matters when trying to match other items).	Both
are relative to the matched pattern.  The character offset for a skip
pattern can be used to tell where to continue looking for an end pattern.

The offset takes the form of "{what}={offset}"
The {what} can be one of seven strings:

ms	Match Start	offset for the start of the matched text
me	Match End	offset for the end of the matched text
hs	Highlight Start	offset for where the highlighting starts
he	Highlight End	offset for where the highlighting ends
rs	Region Start	offset for where the body of a region starts
re	Region End	offset for where the body of a region ends
lc	Leading Context	offset past "leading context" of pattern

The {offset} can be:

s	start of the matched pattern
s+{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
s-{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
e	end of the matched pattern
e+{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
e-{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
{nr}	(for "lc" only): start matching {nr} chars right of the start

Examples: "ms=s+1", "hs=e-2", "lc=3".

Although all offsets are accepted after any pattern, they are not always
meaningful.  This table shows which offsets are actually used:

		    ms	 me   hs   he	rs   re	  lc ~
match item	    yes  yes  yes  yes	-    -	  yes
region item start   yes  -    yes  -	yes  -	  yes
region item skip    -	 yes  -    -	-    -	  yes
region item end     -	 yes  -    yes	-    yes  yes

Offsets can be concatenated, with a ',' in between.  Example: >
  :syn match String  /"[^"]*"/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<
    some "string" text
	  ^^^^^^		highlighted

Notes:
- There must be no white space between the pattern and the character
  offset(s).
- The highlighted area will never be outside of the matched text.
- A negative offset for an end pattern may not always work, because the end
  pattern may be detected when the highlighting should already have stopped.
- Before Vim 7.2 the offsets were counted in bytes instead of characters.
  This didn't work well for multi-byte characters, so it was changed with the
  Vim 7.2 release.
- The start of a match cannot be in a line other than where the pattern
  matched.  This doesn't work: "a\nb"ms=e.  You can make the highlighting
  start in another line, this does work: "a\nb"hs=e.

Example (match a comment but don't highlight the /* and */): >
  :syntax region Comment start="/\*"hs=e+1 end="\*/"he=s-1
<
	/* this is a comment */
	  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	  highlighted

A more complicated Example: >
  :syn region Exa matchgroup=Foo start="foo"hs=s+2,rs=e+2 matchgroup=Bar end="bar"me=e-1,he=e-1,re=s-1
<
	 abcfoostringbarabc
	    mmmmmmmmmmm	    match
	      sssrrreee	    highlight start/region/end ("Foo", "Exa" and "Bar")

Leading context			*:syn-lc* *:syn-leading* *:syn-context*

Note: This is an obsolete feature, only included for backwards compatibility
with previous Vim versions.  It's now recommended to use the |/\@<=| construct
in the pattern.

The "lc" offset specifies leading context -- a part of the pattern that must
be present, but is not considered part of the match.  An offset of "lc=n" will
cause Vim to step back n columns before attempting the pattern match, allowing
characters which have already been matched in previous patterns to also be
used as leading context for this match.  This can be used, for instance, to
specify that an "escaping" character must not precede the match: >

  :syn match ZNoBackslash "[^\\]z"ms=s+1
  :syn match WNoBackslash "[^\\]w"lc=1
  :syn match Underline "_\+"
<
	  ___zzzz ___wwww
	  ^^^	  ^^^	  matches Underline
	      ^ ^	  matches ZNoBackslash
		     ^^^^ matches WNoBackslash

The "ms" offset is automatically set to the same value as the "lc" offset,
unless you set "ms" explicitly.


Multi-line patterns					*:syn-multi-line*

The patterns can include "\n" to match an end-of-line.	Mostly this works as
expected, but there are a few exceptions.

When using a start pattern with an offset, the start of the match is not
allowed to start in a following line.  The highlighting can start in a
following line though.  Using the "\zs" item also requires that the start of
the match doesn't move to another line.

The skip pattern can include the "\n", but the search for an end pattern will
continue in the first character of the next line, also when that character is
matched by the skip pattern.  This is because redrawing may start in any line
halfway a region and there is no check if the skip pattern started in a
previous line.	For example, if the skip pattern is "a\nb" and an end pattern
is "b", the end pattern does match in the second line of this: >
	 x x a
	 b x x
Generally this means that the skip pattern should not match any characters
after the "\n".


External matches					*:syn-ext-match*

These extra regular expression items are available in region patterns:

					*/\z(* */\z(\)* *E50* *E52* *E879*
    \z(\)	Marks the sub-expression as "external", meaning that it can be
		accessed from another pattern match.  Currently only usable in
		defining a syntax region start pattern.

					*/\z1* */\z2* */\z3* */\z4* */\z5*
    \z1  ...  \z9			*/\z6* */\z7* */\z8* */\z9* *E66* *E67*
		Matches the same string that was matched by the corresponding
		sub-expression in a previous start pattern match.

Sometimes the start and end patterns of a region need to share a common
sub-expression.  A common example is the "here" document in Perl and many Unix
shells.  This effect can be achieved with the "\z" special regular expression
items, which marks a sub-expression as "external", in the sense that it can be
referenced from outside the pattern in which it is defined.  The here-document
example, for instance, can be done like this: >
  :syn region hereDoc start="<<\z(\I\i*\)" end="^\z1$"

As can be seen here, the \z actually does double duty.	In the start pattern,
it marks the "\(\I\i*\)" sub-expression as external; in the end pattern, it
changes the \1 back-reference into an external reference referring to the
first external sub-expression in the start pattern.  External references can
also be used in skip patterns: >
  :syn region foo start="start \(\I\i*\)" skip="not end \z1" end="end \z1"

Note that normal and external sub-expressions are completely orthogonal and
indexed separately; for instance, if the pattern "\z(..\)\(..\)" is applied
to the string "aabb", then \1 will refer to "bb" and \z1 will refer to "aa".
Note also that external sub-expressions cannot be accessed as back-references
within the same pattern like normal sub-expressions.  If you want to use one
sub-expression as both a normal and an external sub-expression, you can nest
the two, as in "\(\z(...\)\)".

Note that only matches within a single line can be used.  Multi-line matches
cannot be referred to.

==============================================================================
8. Syntax clusters					*:syn-cluster* *E400*

:sy[ntax] cluster {cluster-name} [contains={group-name}..]
				 [add={group-name}..]
				 [remove={group-name}..]

This command allows you to cluster a list of syntax groups together under a
single name.

	contains={group-name}..
		The cluster is set to the specified list of groups.
	add={group-name}..
		The specified groups are added to the cluster.
	remove={group-name}..
		The specified groups are removed from the cluster.

A cluster so defined may be referred to in a contains=.., containedin=..,
nextgroup=.., add=..  or remove=.. list with a "@" prefix.  You can also use
this notation to implicitly declare a cluster before specifying its contents.

Example: >
   :syntax match Thing "# [^#]\+ #" contains=@ThingMembers
   :syntax cluster ThingMembers contains=ThingMember1,ThingMember2

As the previous example suggests, modifications to a cluster are effectively
retroactive; the membership of the cluster is checked at the last minute, so
to speak: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster AandB contains=A
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@AandB
   :syntax cluster AandB add=B	  " now both keywords are matched in Stuff

This also has implications for nested clusters: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup contains=B
   :syntax cluster BigGroup contains=A,@SmallGroup
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@BigGroup
   :syntax cluster BigGroup remove=B	" no effect, since B isn't in BigGroup
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup remove=B	" now bbb isn't matched within Stuff
<
						*E848*
The maximum number of clusters is 9767.

==============================================================================
9. Including syntax files				*:syn-include* *E397*

It is often useful for one language's syntax file to include a syntax file for
a related language.  Depending on the exact relationship, this can be done in
two different ways:

	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  allowed at the top level in the including syntax, you can simply use
	  the |:runtime| command: >

  " In cpp.vim:
  :runtime! syntax/c.vim
  :unlet b:current_syntax

<	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  contained within a region in the including syntax, you can use the
	  ":syntax include" command:

:sy[ntax] include [@{grouplist-name}] {file-name}

	  All syntax items declared in the included file will have the
	  "contained" flag added.  In addition, if a group list is specified,
	  all top-level syntax items in the included file will be added to
	  that list. >

   " In perl.vim:
   :syntax include @Pod <sfile>:p:h/pod.vim
   :syntax region perlPOD start="^=head" end="^=cut" contains=@Pod
<
	  When {file-name} is an absolute path (starts with "/", "c:", "$VAR"
	  or "<sfile>") that file is sourced.  When it is a relative path
	  (e.g., "syntax/pod.vim") the file is searched for in 'runtimepath'.
	  All matching files are loaded.  Using a relative path is
	  recommended, because it allows a user to replace the included file
	  with his own version, without replacing the file that does the ":syn
	  include".

						*E847*
The maximum number of includes is 999.

==============================================================================
10. Synchronizing				*:syn-sync* *E403* *E404*

Vim wants to be able to start redrawing in any position in the document.  To
make this possible it needs to know the syntax state at the position where
redrawing starts.

:sy[ntax] sync [ccomment [group-name] | minlines={N} | ...]

There are four ways to synchronize:
1. Always parse from the start of the file.
   |:syn-sync-first|
2. Based on C-style comments.  Vim understands how C-comments work and can
   figure out if the current line starts inside or outside a comment.
   |:syn-sync-second|
3. Jumping back a certain number of lines and start parsing there.
   |:syn-sync-third|
4. Searching backwards in the text for a pattern to sync on.
   |:syn-sync-fourth|

				*:syn-sync-maxlines* *:syn-sync-minlines*
For the last three methods, the line range where the parsing can start is
limited by "minlines" and "maxlines".

If the "minlines={N}" argument is given, the parsing always starts at least
that many lines backwards.  This can be used if the parsing may take a few
lines before it's correct, or when it's not possible to use syncing.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given, the number of lines that are searched
for a comment or syncing pattern is restricted to N lines backwards (after
adding "minlines").  This is useful if you have few things to sync on and a
slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment maxlines=500
<
						*:syn-sync-linebreaks*
When using a pattern that matches multiple lines, a change in one line may
cause a pattern to no longer match in a previous line.	This means has to
start above where the change was made.	How many lines can be specified with
the "linebreaks" argument.  For example, when a pattern may include one line
break use this: >
   :syntax sync linebreaks=1
The result is that redrawing always starts at least one line before where a
change was made.  The default value for "linebreaks" is zero.  Usually the
value for "minlines" is bigger than "linebreaks".


First syncing method:			*:syn-sync-first*
>
   :syntax sync fromstart

The file will be parsed from the start.  This makes syntax highlighting
accurate, but can be slow for long files.  Vim caches previously parsed text,
so that it's only slow when parsing the text for the first time.  However,
when making changes some part of the text needs to be parsed again (worst
case: to the end of the file).

Using "fromstart" is equivalent to using "minlines" with a very large number.


Second syncing method:			*:syn-sync-second* *:syn-sync-ccomment*

For the second method, only the "ccomment" argument needs to be given.
Example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment

When Vim finds that the line where displaying starts is inside a C-style
comment, the last region syntax item with the group-name "Comment" will be
used.  This requires that there is a region with the group-name "Comment"!
An alternate group name can be specified, for example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment javaComment
This means that the last item specified with "syn region javaComment" will be
used for the detected C comment region.  This only works properly if that
region does have a start pattern "\/*" and an end pattern "*\/".

The "maxlines" argument can be used to restrict the search to a number of
lines.	The "minlines" argument can be used to at least start a number of
lines back (e.g., for when there is some construct that only takes a few
lines, but it hard to sync on).

Note: Syncing on a C comment doesn't work properly when strings are used
that cross a line and contain a "*/".  Since letting strings cross a line
is a bad programming habit (many compilers give a warning message), and the
chance of a "*/" appearing inside a comment is very small, this restriction
is hardly ever noticed.


Third syncing method:				*:syn-sync-third*

For the third method, only the "minlines={N}" argument needs to be given.
Vim will subtract {N} from the line number and start parsing there.  This
means {N} extra lines need to be parsed, which makes this method a bit slower.
Example: >
   :syntax sync minlines=50

"lines" is equivalent to "minlines" (used by older versions).


Fourth syncing method:				*:syn-sync-fourth*

The idea is to synchronize on the end of a few specific regions, called a
sync pattern.  Only regions can cross lines, so when we find the end of some
region, we might be able to know in which syntax item we are.  The search
starts in the line just above the one where redrawing starts.  From there
the search continues backwards in the file.

This works just like the non-syncing syntax items.  You can use contained
matches, nextgroup, etc.  But there are a few differences:
- Keywords cannot be used.
- The syntax items with the "sync" keyword form a completely separated group
  of syntax items.  You can't mix syncing groups and non-syncing groups.
- The matching works backwards in the buffer (line by line), instead of
  forwards.
- A line continuation pattern can be given.  It is used to decide which group
  of lines need to be searched like they were one line.  This means that the
  search for a match with the specified items starts in the first of the
  consecutive that contain the continuation pattern.
- When using "nextgroup" or "contains", this only works within one line (or
  group of continued lines).
- When using a region, it must start and end in the same line (or group of
  continued lines).  Otherwise the end is assumed to be at the end of the
  line (or group of continued lines).
- When a match with a sync pattern is found, the rest of the line (or group of
  continued lines) is searched for another match.  The last match is used.
  This is used when a line can contain both the start end the end of a region
  (e.g., in a C-comment like /* this */, the last "*/" is used).

There are two ways how a match with a sync pattern can be used:
1. Parsing for highlighting starts where redrawing starts (and where the
   search for the sync pattern started).  The syntax group that is expected
   to be valid there must be specified.  This works well when the regions
   that cross lines cannot contain other regions.
2. Parsing for highlighting continues just after the match.  The syntax group
   that is expected to be present just after the match must be specified.
   This can be used when the previous method doesn't work well.  It's much
   slower, because more text needs to be parsed.
Both types of sync patterns can be used at the same time.

Besides the sync patterns, other matches and regions can be specified, to
avoid finding unwanted matches.

[The reason that the sync patterns are given separately, is that mostly the
search for the sync point can be much simpler than figuring out the
highlighting.  The reduced number of patterns means it will go (much)
faster.]

					    *syn-sync-grouphere* *E393* *E394*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} grouphere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Define a match that is used for syncing.  {group-name} is the
	name of a syntax group that follows just after the match.  Parsing
	of the text for highlighting starts just after the match.  A region
	must exist for this {group-name}.  The first one defined will be used.
	"NONE" can be used for when there is no syntax group after the match.

						*syn-sync-groupthere*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} groupthere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Like "grouphere", but {group-name} is the name of a syntax group that
	is to be used at the start of the line where searching for the sync
	point started.	The text between the match and the start of the sync
	pattern searching is assumed not to change the syntax highlighting.
	For example, in C you could search backwards for "/*" and "*/".  If
	"/*" is found first, you know that you are inside a comment, so the
	"groupthere" is "cComment".  If "*/" is found first, you know that you
	are not in a comment, so the "groupthere" is "NONE".  (in practice
	it's a bit more complicated, because the "/*" and "*/" could appear
	inside a string.  That's left as an exercise to the reader...).

    :syntax sync match ..
    :syntax sync region ..

	Without a "groupthere" argument.  Define a region or match that is
	skipped while searching for a sync point.

						*syn-sync-linecont*
    :syntax sync linecont {pattern}

	When {pattern} matches in a line, it is considered to continue in
	the next line.	This means that the search for a sync point will
	consider the lines to be concatenated.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given too, the number of lines that are
searched for a match is restricted to N.  This is useful if you have very
few things to sync on and a slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync maxlines=100

You can clear all sync settings with: >
   :syntax sync clear

You can clear specific sync patterns with: >
   :syntax sync clear {sync-group-name} ..

==============================================================================
11. Listing syntax items		*:syntax* *:sy* *:syn* *:syn-list*

This command lists all the syntax items: >

    :sy[ntax] [list]

To show the syntax items for one syntax group: >

    :sy[ntax] list {group-name}

To list the syntax groups in one cluster:			*E392*	 >

    :sy[ntax] list @{cluster-name}

See above for other arguments for the ":syntax" command.

Note that the ":syntax" command can be abbreviated to ":sy", although ":syn"
is mostly used, because it looks better.

==============================================================================
12. Highlight command			*:highlight* *:hi* *E28* *E411* *E415*

There are three types of highlight groups:
- The ones used for specific languages.  For these the name starts with the
  name of the language.  Many of these don't have any attributes, but are
  linked to a group of the second type.
- The ones used for all syntax languages.
- The ones used for the 'highlight' option.
							*hitest.vim*
You can see all the groups currently active with this command: >
    :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/hitest.vim
This will open a new window containing all highlight group names, displayed
in their own color.

						*:colo* *:colorscheme* *E185*
:colo[rscheme]		Output the name of the currently active color scheme.
			This is basically the same as >
				:echo g:colors_name
<			In case g:colors_name has not been defined :colo will
			output "default".  When compiled without the |+eval|
			feature it will output "unknown".

:colo[rscheme] {name}	Load color scheme {name}.  This searches 'runtimepath'
			for the file "colors/{name}.vim".  The first one that
			is found is loaded.
			To see the name of the currently active color scheme: >
				:colo
<			The name is also stored in the g:colors_name variable.
			Doesn't work recursively, thus you can't use
			":colorscheme" in a color scheme script.
			After the color scheme has been loaded the
			|ColorScheme| autocommand event is triggered.
			For info about writing a colorscheme file: >
				:edit $VIMRUNTIME/colors/README.txt

:hi[ghlight]		List all the current highlight groups that have
			attributes set.

:hi[ghlight] {group-name}
			List one highlight group.

:hi[ghlight] clear	Reset all highlighting to the defaults.  Removes all
			highlighting for groups added by the user!
			Uses the current value of 'background' to decide which
			default colors to use.

:hi[ghlight] clear {group-name}
:hi[ghlight] {group-name} NONE
			Disable the highlighting for one highlight group.  It
			is _not_ set back to the default colors.

:hi[ghlight] [default] {group-name} {key}={arg} ..
			Add a highlight group, or change the highlighting for
			an existing group.
			See |highlight-args| for the {key}={arg} arguments.
			See |:highlight-default| for the optional [default]
			argument.

Normally a highlight group is added once when starting up.  This sets the
default values for the highlighting.  After that, you can use additional
highlight commands to change the arguments that you want to set to non-default
values.  The value "NONE" can be used to switch the value off or go back to
the default value.

A simple way to change colors is with the |:colorscheme| command.  This loads
a file with ":highlight" commands such as this: >

   :hi Comment	gui=bold

Note that all settings that are not included remain the same, only the
specified field is used, and settings are merged with previous ones.  So, the
result is like this single command has been used: >
   :hi Comment	term=bold ctermfg=Cyan guifg=#80a0ff gui=bold
<
							*:highlight-verbose*
When listing a highlight group and 'verbose' is non-zero, the listing will
also tell where it was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose hi Comment
<	Comment        xxx term=bold ctermfg=4 guifg=Blue ~
	   Last set from /home/mool/vim/vim7/runtime/syntax/syncolor.vim ~

When ":hi clear" is used then the script where this command is used will be
mentioned for the default values. See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

					*highlight-args* *E416* *E417* *E423*
There are three types of terminals for highlighting:
term	a normal terminal (vt100, xterm)
cterm	a color terminal (MS-DOS console, color-xterm, these have the "Co"
	termcap entry)
gui	the GUI

For each type the highlighting can be given.  This makes it possible to use
the same syntax file on all terminals, and use the optimal highlighting.

1. highlight arguments for normal terminals

					*bold* *underline* *undercurl*
					*inverse* *italic* *standout*
term={attr-list}			*attr-list* *highlight-term* *E418*
	attr-list is a comma separated list (without spaces) of the
	following items (in any order):
		bold
		underline
		undercurl	not always available
		reverse
		inverse		same as reverse
		italic
		standout
		NONE		no attributes used (used to reset it)

	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	"undercurl" is a curly underline.  When "undercurl" is not possible
	then "underline" is used.  In general "undercurl" is only available in
	the GUI.  The color is set with |highlight-guisp|.

start={term-list}				*highlight-start* *E422*
stop={term-list}				*term-list* *highlight-stop*
	These lists of terminal codes can be used to get
	non-standard attributes on a terminal.

	The escape sequence specified with the "start" argument
	is written before the characters in the highlighted
	area.  It can be anything that you want to send to the
	terminal to highlight this area.  The escape sequence
	specified with the "stop" argument is written after the
	highlighted area.  This should undo the "start" argument.
	Otherwise the screen will look messed up.

	The {term-list} can have two forms:

	1. A string with escape sequences.
	   This is any string of characters, except that it can't start with
	   "t_" and blanks are not allowed.  The <> notation is recognized
	   here, so you can use things like "<Esc>" and "<Space>".  Example:
		start=<Esc>[27h;<Esc>[<Space>r;

	2. A list of terminal codes.
	   Each terminal code has the form "t_xx", where "xx" is the name of
	   the termcap entry.  The codes have to be separated with commas.
	   White space is not allowed.	Example:
		start=t_C1,t_BL
	   The terminal codes must exist for this to work.


2. highlight arguments for color terminals

cterm={attr-list}					*highlight-cterm*
	See above for the description of {attr-list} |attr-list|.
	The "cterm" argument is likely to be different from "term", when
	colors are used.  For example, in a normal terminal comments could
	be underlined, in a color terminal they can be made Blue.
	Note: Many terminals (e.g., DOS console) can't mix these attributes
	with coloring.	Use only one of "cterm=" OR "ctermfg=" OR "ctermbg=".

ctermfg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermfg* *E421*
ctermbg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermbg*
	The {color-nr} argument is a color number.  Its range is zero to
	(not including) the number given by the termcap entry "Co".
	The actual color with this number depends on the type of terminal
	and its settings.  Sometimes the color also depends on the settings of
	"cterm".  For example, on some systems "cterm=bold ctermfg=3" gives
	another color, on others you just get color 3.

	For an xterm this depends on your resources, and is a bit
	unpredictable.	See your xterm documentation for the defaults.	The
	colors for a color-xterm can be changed from the .Xdefaults file.
	Unfortunately this means that it's not possible to get the same colors
	for each user.	See |xterm-color| for info about color xterms.

	The MSDOS standard colors are fixed (in a console window), so these
	have been used for the names.  But the meaning of color names in X11
	are fixed, so these color settings have been used, to make the
	highlighting settings portable (complicated, isn't it?).  The
	following names are recognized, with the color number used:

							*cterm-colors*
	    NR-16   NR-8    COLOR NAME ~
	    0	    0	    Black
	    1	    4	    DarkBlue
	    2	    2	    DarkGreen
	    3	    6	    DarkCyan
	    4	    1	    DarkRed
	    5	    5	    DarkMagenta
	    6	    3	    Brown, DarkYellow
	    7	    7	    LightGray, LightGrey, Gray, Grey
	    8	    0*	    DarkGray, DarkGrey
	    9	    4*	    Blue, LightBlue
	    10	    2*	    Green, LightGreen
	    11	    6*	    Cyan, LightCyan
	    12	    1*	    Red, LightRed
	    13	    5*	    Magenta, LightMagenta
	    14	    3*	    Yellow, LightYellow
	    15	    7*	    White

	The number under "NR-16" is used for 16-color terminals ('t_Co'
	greater than or equal to 16).  The number under "NR-8" is used for
	8-color terminals ('t_Co' less than 16).  The '*' indicates that the
	bold attribute is set for ctermfg.  In many 8-color terminals (e.g.,
	"linux"), this causes the bright colors to appear.  This doesn't work
	for background colors!	Without the '*' the bold attribute is removed.
	If you want to set the bold attribute in a different way, put a
	"cterm=" argument AFTER the "ctermfg=" or "ctermbg=" argument.	Or use
	a number instead of a color name.

	The case of the color names is ignored.
	Note that for 16 color ansi style terminals (including xterms), the
	numbers in the NR-8 column is used.  Here '*' means 'add 8' so that Blue
	is 12, DarkGray is 8 etc.

	Note that for some color terminals these names may result in the wrong
	colors!

							*:hi-normal-cterm*
	When setting the "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" colors for the Normal group,
	these will become the colors used for the non-highlighted text.
	Example: >
		:highlight Normal ctermfg=grey ctermbg=darkblue
<	When setting the "ctermbg" color for the Normal group, the
	'background' option will be adjusted automatically.  This causes the
	highlight groups that depend on 'background' to change!  This means
	you should set the colors for Normal first, before setting other
	colors.
	When a colorscheme is being used, changing 'background' causes it to
	be reloaded, which may reset all colors (including Normal).  First
	delete the "g:colors_name" variable when you don't want this.

	When you have set "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" for the Normal group, Vim
	needs to reset the color when exiting.	This is done with the "op"
	termcap entry |t_op|.  If this doesn't work correctly, try setting the
	't_op' option in your .vimrc.
							*E419* *E420*
	When Vim knows the normal foreground and background colors, "fg" and
	"bg" can be used as color names.  This only works after setting the
	colors for the Normal group and for the MS-DOS console.  Example, for
	reverse video: >
	    :highlight Visual ctermfg=bg ctermbg=fg
<	Note that the colors are used that are valid at the moment this
	command are given.  If the Normal group colors are changed later, the
	"fg" and "bg" colors will not be adjusted.


3. highlight arguments for the GUI

gui={attr-list}						*highlight-gui*
	These give the attributes to use in the GUI mode.
	See |attr-list| for a description.
	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	Note that the attributes are ignored for the "Normal" group.

font={font-name}					*highlight-font*
	font-name is the name of a font, as it is used on the system Vim
	runs on.  For X11 this is a complicated name, for example: >
   font=-misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-iso8859-1
<
	The font-name "NONE" can be used to revert to the default font.
	When setting the font for the "Normal" group, this becomes the default
	font (until the 'guifont' option is changed; the last one set is
	used).
	The following only works with Motif and Athena, not with other GUIs:
	When setting the font for the "Menu" group, the menus will be changed.
	When setting the font for the "Tooltip" group, the tooltips will be
	changed.
	All fonts used, except for Menu and Tooltip, should be of the same
	character size as the default font!  Otherwise redrawing problems will
	occur.

guifg={color-name}					*highlight-guifg*
guibg={color-name}					*highlight-guibg*
guisp={color-name}					*highlight-guisp*
	These give the foreground (guifg), background (guibg) and special
	(guisp) color to use in the GUI.  "guisp" is used for undercurl.
	There are a few special names:
		NONE		no color (transparent)
		bg		use normal background color
		background	use normal background color
		fg		use normal foreground color
		foreground	use normal foreground color
	To use a color name with an embedded space or other special character,
	put it in single quotes.  The single quote cannot be used then.
	Example: >
	    :hi comment guifg='salmon pink'
<
							*gui-colors*
	Suggested color names (these are available on most systems):
	    Red		LightRed	DarkRed
	    Green	LightGreen	DarkGreen	SeaGreen
	    Blue	LightBlue	DarkBlue	SlateBlue
	    Cyan	LightCyan	DarkCyan
	    Magenta	LightMagenta	DarkMagenta
	    Yellow	LightYellow	Brown		DarkYellow
	    Gray	LightGray	DarkGray
	    Black	White
	    Orange	Purple		Violet

	In the Win32 GUI version, additional system colors are available.  See
	|win32-colors|.

	You can also specify a color by its Red, Green and Blue values.
	The format is "#rrggbb", where
		"rr"	is the Red value
		"gg"	is the Green value
		"bb"	is the Blue value
	All values are hexadecimal, range from "00" to "ff".  Examples: >
  :highlight Comment guifg=#11f0c3 guibg=#ff00ff
<
					*highlight-groups* *highlight-default*

Title		titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
							*hl-Visual*
Visual		Visual mode selection
							*hl-VisualNOS*
VisualNOS	Visual mode selection when vim is "Not Owning the Selection".
		Only X11 Gui's |gui-x11| and |xterm-clipboard| supports this.
							*hl-WarningMsg*
WarningMsg	warning messages
							*hl-WildMenu*
WildMenu	current match in 'wildmenu' completion

					*hl-User1* *hl-User1..9* *hl-User9*
The 'statusline' syntax allows the use of 9 different highlights in the
statusline and ruler (via 'rulerformat').  The names are User1 to User9.

For the GUI you can use the following groups to set the colors for the menu,
scrollbars and tooltips.  They don't have defaults.  This doesn't work for the
Win32 GUI.  Only three highlight arguments have any effect here: font, guibg,
and guifg.

							*hl-Menu*
Menu		Current font, background and foreground colors of the menus.
		Also used for the toolbar.
		Applicable highlight arguments: font, guibg, guifg.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.

							*hl-Scrollbar*
Scrollbar	Current background and foreground of the main window's
		scrollbars.
		Applicable highlight arguments: guibg, guifg.

							*hl-Tooltip*
Tooltip		Current font, background and foreground of the tooltips.
		Applicable highlight arguments: font, guibg, guifg.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.

==============================================================================
13. Linking groups		*:hi-link* *:highlight-link* *E412* *E413*

When you want to use the same highlighting for several syntax groups, you
can do this more easily by linking the groups into one common highlight
group, and give the color attributes only for that group.

To set a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} {to-group}

To remove a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} NONE

Notes:							*E414*
- If the {from-group} and/or {to-group} doesn't exist, it is created.  You
  don't get an error message for a non-existing group.
- As soon as you use a ":highlight" command for a linked group, the link is
  removed.
- If there are already highlight settings for the {from-group}, the link is
  not made, unless the '!' is given.  For a ":highlight link" command in a
  sourced file, you don't get an error message.  This can be used to skip
  links for groups that already have settings.

					*:hi-default* *:highlight-default*
The [default] argument is used for setting the default highlighting for a
group.	If highlighting has already been specified for the group the command
will be ignored.  Also when there is an existing link.

Using [default] is especially useful to overrule the highlighting of a
specific syntax file.  For example, the C syntax file contains: >
	:highlight default link cComment Comment
If you like Question highlighting for C comments, put this in your vimrc file: >
	:highlight link cComment Question
Without the "default" in the C syntax file, the highlighting would be
overruled when the syntax file is loaded.

==============================================================================
14. Cleaning up						*:syn-clear* *E391*

If you want to clear the syntax stuff for the current buffer, you can use this
command: >
  :syntax clear

This command should be used when you want to switch off syntax highlighting,
or when you want to switch to using another syntax.  It's normally not needed
in a syntax file itself, because syntax is cleared by the autocommands that
load the syntax file.
The command also deletes the "b:current_syntax" variable, since no syntax is
loaded after this command.

If you want to disable syntax highlighting for all buffers, you need to remove
the autocommands that load the syntax files: >
  :syntax off

What this command actually does, is executing the command >
  :source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
See the "nosyntax.vim" file for details.  Note that for this to work
$VIMRUNTIME must be valid.  See |$VIMRUNTIME|.

To clean up specific syntax groups for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear {group-name} ..
This removes all patterns and keywords for {group-name}.

To clean up specific syntax group lists for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear @{grouplist-name} ..
This sets {grouplist-name}'s contents to an empty list.

						*:syntax-reset* *:syn-reset*
If you have changed the colors and messed them up, use this command to get the
defaults back: >

  :syntax reset

This doesn't change the colors for the 'highlight' option.

Note that the syntax colors that you set in your vimrc file will also be reset
back to their Vim default.
Note that if you are using a color scheme, the colors defined by the color
scheme for syntax highlighting will be lost.

What this actually does is: >

	let g:syntax_cmd = "reset"
	runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim

Note that this uses the 'runtimepath' option.

							*syncolor*
If you want to use different colors for syntax highlighting, you can add a Vim
script file to set these colors.  Put this file in a directory in
'runtimepath' which comes after $VIMRUNTIME, so that your settings overrule
the default colors.  This way these colors will be used after the ":syntax
reset" command.

For Unix you can use the file ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim.  Example: >

	if &background == "light"
	  highlight comment ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
	else
	  highlight comment ctermfg=green guifg=green
	endif

								*E679*
Do make sure this syncolor.vim script does not use a "syntax on", set the
'background' option or uses a "colorscheme" command, because it results in an
endless loop.

Note that when a color scheme is used, there might be some confusion whether
your defined colors are to be used or the colors from the scheme.  This
depends on the color scheme file.  See |:colorscheme|.

							*syntax_cmd*
The "syntax_cmd" variable is set to one of these values when the
syntax/syncolor.vim files are loaded:
   "on"		":syntax on" command.  Highlight colors are overruled but
		links are kept
   "enable"	":syntax enable" command.  Only define colors for groups that
		don't have highlighting yet.  Use ":syntax default".
   "reset"	":syntax reset" command or loading a color scheme.  Define all
		the colors.
   "skip"	Don't define colors.  Used to skip the default settings when a
		syncolor.vim file earlier in 'runtimepath' has already set
		them.

==============================================================================
15. Highlighting tags					*tag-highlight*

If you want to highlight all the tags in your file, you can use the following
mappings.

	<F11>	-- Generate tags.vim file, and highlight tags.
	<F12>	-- Just highlight tags based on existing tags.vim file.
>
  :map <F11>  :sp tags<CR>:%s/^\([^	:]*:\)\=\([^	]*\).*/syntax keyword Tag \2/<CR>:wq! tags.vim<CR>/^<CR><F12>
  :map <F12>  :so tags.vim<CR>

WARNING: The longer the tags file, the slower this will be, and the more
memory Vim will consume.

Only highlighting typedefs, unions and structs can be done too.  For this you
must use Exuberant ctags (found at http://ctags.sf.net).

Put these lines in your Makefile:

# Make a highlight file for types.  Requires Exuberant ctags and awk
types: types.vim
types.vim: *.[ch]
	ctags --c-kinds=gstu -o- *.[ch] |\
		awk 'BEGIN{printf("syntax keyword Type\t")}\
			{printf("%s ", $$1)}END{print ""}' > $@

And put these lines in your .vimrc: >

   " load the types.vim highlighting file, if it exists
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] let fname = expand('<afile>:p:h') . '/types.vim'
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] if filereadable(fname)
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch]   exe 'so ' . fname
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] endif

==============================================================================
16. Window-local syntax				*:ownsyntax*

Normally all windows on a buffer share the same syntax settings. It is
possible, however, to set a particular window on a file to have its own
private syntax setting. A possible example would be to edit LaTeX source
with conventional highlighting in one window, while seeing the same source
highlighted differently (so as to hide control sequences and indicate bold,
italic etc regions) in another. The 'scrollbind' option is useful here.

To set the current window to have the syntax "foo", separately from all other
windows on the buffer: >
   :ownsyntax foo
<						*w:current_syntax*
This will set the "w:current_syntax" variable to "foo".  The value of
"b:current_syntax" does not change.  This is implemented by saving and
restoring "b:current_syntax", since the syntax files do set
"b:current_syntax".  The value set by the syntax file is assigned to
"w:current_syntax".

Once a window has its own syntax, syntax commands executed from other windows
on the same buffer (including :syntax clear) have no effect. Conversely,
syntax commands executed from that window do not affect other windows on the
same buffer.

A window with its own syntax reverts to normal behavior when another buffer
is loaded into that window or the file is reloaded.
When splitting the window, the new window will use the original syntax.

==============================================================================
17. Color xterms				*xterm-color* *color-xterm*

Most color xterms have only eight colors.  If you don't get colors with the
default setup, it should work with these lines in your .vimrc: >
   :if &term =~ "xterm"
   :  if has("terminfo")
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%p1%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%p1%dm
   :  else
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :  endif
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

You might want to change the first "if" to match the name of your terminal,
e.g. "dtterm" instead of "xterm".

Note: Do these settings BEFORE doing ":syntax on".  Otherwise the colors may
be wrong.
							*xiterm* *rxvt*
The above settings have been mentioned to work for xiterm and rxvt too.
But for using 16 colors in an rxvt these should work with terminfo: >
	:set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t25;%p1%{40}%+%e5;%p1%{32}%+%;%dm
	:set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t22;%p1%{30}%+%e1;%p1%{22}%+%;%dm
<
							*colortest.vim*
To test your color setup, a file has been included in the Vim distribution.
To use it, execute this command: >
   :runtime syntax/colortest.vim

Some versions of xterm (and other terminals, like the Linux console) can
output lighter foreground colors, even though the number of colors is defined
at 8.  Therefore Vim sets the "cterm=bold" attribute for light foreground
colors, when 't_Co' is 8.

							*xfree-xterm*
To get 16 colors or more, get the newest xterm version (which should be
included with XFree86 3.3 and later).  You can also find the latest version
at: >
	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html
Here is a good way to configure it.  This uses 88 colors and enables the
termcap-query feature, which allows Vim to ask the xterm how many colors it
supports. >
	./configure --disable-bold-color --enable-88-color --enable-tcap-query
If you only get 8 colors, check the xterm compilation settings.
(Also see |UTF8-xterm| for using this xterm with UTF-8 character encoding).

This xterm should work with these lines in your .vimrc (for 16 colors): >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{92}%+%;%dm
   :  set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{82}%+%;%dm
   :else
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

Without |+terminfo|, Vim will recognize these settings, and automatically
translate cterm colors of 8 and above to "<Esc>[9%dm" and "<Esc>[10%dm".
Colors above 16 are also translated automatically.

For 256 colors this has been reported to work: >

   :set t_AB=<Esc>[48;5;%dm
   :set t_AF=<Esc>[38;5;%dm

Or just set the TERM environment variable to "xterm-color" or "xterm-16color"
and try if that works.

You probably want to use these X resources (in your ~/.Xdefaults file):
	XTerm*color0:			#000000
	XTerm*color1:			#c00000
	XTerm*color2:			#008000
	XTerm*color3:			#808000
	XTerm*color4:			#0000c0
	XTerm*color5:			#c000c0
	XTerm*color6:			#008080
	XTerm*color7:			#c0c0c0
	XTerm*color8:			#808080
	XTerm*color9:			#ff6060
	XTerm*color10:			#00ff00
	XTerm*color11:			#ffff00
	XTerm*color12:			#8080ff
	XTerm*color13:			#ff40ff
	XTerm*color14:			#00ffff
	XTerm*color15:			#ffffff
	Xterm*cursorColor:		Black

[Note: The cursorColor is required to work around a bug, which changes the
cursor color to the color of the last drawn text.  This has been fixed by a
newer version of xterm, but not everybody is using it yet.]

To get these right away, reload the .Xdefaults file to the X Option database
Manager (you only need to do this when you just changed the .Xdefaults file): >
  xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
<
					*xterm-blink* *xterm-blinking-cursor*
To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see tools/blink.c.  Or use Thomas
Dickey's xterm above patchlevel 107 (see above for where to get it), with
these resources:
	XTerm*cursorBlink:	on
	XTerm*cursorOnTime:	400
	XTerm*cursorOffTime:	250
	XTerm*cursorColor:	White

							*hpterm-color*
These settings work (more or less) for an hpterm, which only supports 8
foreground colors: >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%p1%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :else
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

						*Eterm* *enlightened-terminal*
These settings have been reported to work for the Enlightened terminal
emulator, or Eterm.  They might work for all xterm-like terminals that use the
bold attribute to get bright colors.  Add an ":if" like above when needed. >
       :set t_Co=16
       :set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{22}%+%d;1%;m
       :set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{32}%+%d;1%;m
<
						*TTpro-telnet*
These settings should work for TTpro telnet.  Tera Term Pro is a freeware /
open-source program for MS-Windows. >
	set t_Co=16
	set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{32}%+5;%;%dm
	set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{22}%+1;%;%dm
Also make sure TTpro's Setup / Window / Full Color is enabled, and make sure
that Setup / Font / Enable Bold is NOT enabled.

==============================================================================
18. When syntax is slow						*:syntime*

This is aimed at authors of a syntax file.

If your syntax causes redrawing to be slow, here are a few hints on making it
faster.  To see slowness switch on some features that usually interfere, such
as 'relativenumber' and |folding|.

Note: this is only available when compiled with the |+profile| feature.
You many need to build Vim with "huge" features.

To find out what patterns are consuming most time, get an overview with this
sequence: >
	:syntime on
	[ redraw the text at least once with CTRL-L ]
	:syntime report

This will display a list of syntax patterns that were used, sorted by the time
it took to match them against the text.

:syntime on		Start measuring syntax times.  This will add some
			overhead to compute the time spent on syntax pattern
			matching.

:syntime off		Stop measuring syntax times.

:syntime clear		Set all the counters to zero, restart measuring.

:syntime report		Show the syntax items used since ":syntime on" in the
			current window.  Use a wider display to see more of
			the output.

			The list is sorted by total time. The columns are:
			TOTAL		Total time in seconds spent on
					matching this pattern.
			COUNT		Number of times the pattern was used.
			MATCH		Number of times the pattern actually
					matched
			SLOWEST		The longest time for one try.
			AVERAGE		The average time for one try.
			NAME		Name of the syntax item.  Note that
					this is not unique.
			PATTERN		The pattern being used.

Pattern matching gets slow when it has to try many alternatives.  Try to
include as much literal text as possible to reduce the number of ways a
pattern does NOT match.

When using the "\@<=" and "\@<!" items, add a maximum size to avoid trying at
all positions in the current and previous line.  For example, if the item is
literal text specify the size of that text (in bytes):

"<\@<=span"	Matches "span" in "<span".  This tries matching with "<" in
		many places.
"<\@1<=span"	Matches the same, but only tries one byte before "span".

Editing with windows in multiple tab pages.		*tab-page* *tabpage*

The commands which have been added to use multiple tab pages are explained
here.  Additionally, there are explanations for commands that work differently
when used in combination with more than one tab page.

1. Introduction			|tab-page-intro|
2. Commands			|tab-page-commands|
3. Other items			|tab-page-other|
4. Setting 'tabline'		|setting-tabline|
5. Setting 'guitablabel'	|setting-guitablabel|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}
{not able to use multiple tab pages when the |+windows| feature was disabled
at compile time}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*tab-page-intro*

A tab page holds one or more windows.  You can easily switch between tab
pages, so that you have several collections of windows to work on different
things.

Usually you will see a list of labels at the top of the Vim window, one for
each tab page.  With the mouse you can click on the label to jump to that tab
page.  There are other ways to move between tab pages, see below.

Most commands work only in the current tab page.  That includes the |CTRL-W|
commands, |:windo|, |:all| and |:ball| (when not using the |:tab| modifier).
The commands that are aware of other tab pages than the current one are
mentioned below.

Tabs are also a nice way to edit a buffer temporarily without changing the
current window layout.  Open a new tab page, do whatever you want to do and
close the tab page.

==============================================================================
2. Commands						*tab-page-commands*

OPENING A NEW TAB PAGE:

When starting Vim "vim -p filename ..." opens each file argument in a separate
tab page (up to 'tabpagemax').  See |-p|

A double click with the mouse in the non-GUI tab pages line opens a new, empty
tab page.  It is placed left of the position of the click.  The first click
may select another tab page first, causing an extra screen update.

This also works in a few GUI versions, esp. Win32 and Motif.  But only when
clicking right of the labels.

In the GUI tab pages line you can use the right mouse button to open menu.
|tabline-menu|.

:[count]tabe[dit]				*:tabe* *:tabedit* *:tabnew*
:[count]tabnew
		Open a new tab page with an empty window, after the current
		tab page.  For [count] see |:tab| below.

:[count]tabe[dit] [++opt] [+cmd] {file}
:[count]tabnew [++opt] [+cmd] {file}
		Open a new tab page and edit {file}, like with |:edit|.
		For [count] see |:tab| below.

:[count]tabf[ind] [++opt] [+cmd] {file}			*:tabf* *:tabfind*
		Open a new tab page and edit {file} in 'path', like with
		|:find|.  For [count] see |:tab| below.
		{not available when the |+file_in_path| feature was disabled
		at compile time}

:[count]tab {cmd}					*:tab*
		Execute {cmd} and when it opens a new window open a new tab
		page instead.  Doesn't work for |:diffsplit|, |:diffpatch|,
		|:execute| and |:normal|.
		When [count] is omitted the tab page appears after the current
		one.
		When [count] is specified the new tab page comes after tab
		page [count].  Use ":0tab cmd" to get the new tab page as the
		first one.
		Examples: >
			:tab split	" opens current buffer in new tab page
			:tab help gt	" opens tab page with help for "gt"

CTRL-W gf	Open a new tab page and edit the file name under the cursor.
		See |CTRL-W_gf|.

CTRL-W gF	Open a new tab page and edit the file name under the cursor
		and jump to the line number following the file name.
		See |CTRL-W_gF|.

CLOSING A TAB PAGE:

Closing the last window of a tab page closes the tab page too, unless there is
only one tab page.

Using the mouse: If the tab page line is displayed you can click in the "X" at
the top right to close the current tab page.  A custom |'tabline'| may show
something else.

							*:tabc* *:tabclose*
:tabc[lose][!]	Close current tab page.
		This command fails when:
		- There is only one tab page on the screen.		*E784*
		- When 'hidden' is not set, [!] is not used, a buffer has
		  changes, and there is no other window on this buffer.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.

:tabc[lose][!] {count}
		Close tab page {count}.  Fails in the same way as `:tabclose`
		above.

							*:tabo* *:tabonly*
:tabo[nly][!]	Close all other tab pages.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.


SWITCHING TO ANOTHER TAB PAGE:

Using the mouse: If the tab page line is displayed you can click in a tab page
label to switch to that tab page.  Click where there is no label to go to the
next tab page.  |'tabline'|

:tabn[ext]				*:tabn* *:tabnext* *gt*
<C-PageDown>				*CTRL-<PageDown>* *<C-PageDown>*
gt					*i_CTRL-<PageDown>* *i_<C-PageDown>*
		Go to the next tab page.  Wraps around from the last to the
		first one.

:tabn[ext] {count}
{count}<C-PageDown>
{count}gt	Go to tab page {count}.  The first tab page has number one.


:tabp[revious]				*:tabp* *:tabprevious* *gT* *:tabN*
:tabN[ext]				*:tabNext* *CTRL-<PageUp>*
<C-PageUp>			 *<C-PageUp>* *i_CTRL-<PageUp>* *i_<C-PageUp>*
gT		Go to the previous tab page.  Wraps around from the first one
		to the last one.

:tabp[revious] {count}
:tabN[ext] {count}
{count}<C-PageUp>
{count}gT	Go {count} tab pages back.  Wraps around from the first one
		to the last one.

:tabr[ewind]			*:tabfir* *:tabfirst* *:tabr* *:tabrewind*
:tabfir[st]	Go to the first tab page.

							*:tabl* *:tablast*
:tabl[ast]	Go to the last tab page.


Other commands:
							*:tabs*
:tabs		List the tab pages and the windows they contain.
		Shows a ">" for the current window.
		Shows a "+" for modified buffers.


REORDERING TAB PAGES:

:tabm[ove] [N]						*:tabm* *:tabmove*
:[N]tabm[ove]
		Move the current tab page to after tab page N.  Use zero to
		make the current tab page the first one.  Without N the tab
		page is made the last one.

:tabm[ove] +[N]
:tabm[ove] -[N]
		Move the current tab page N places to the right (with +) or to
		the left (with -).

Note that although it is possible to move a tab behind the N-th one by using
:Ntabmove, it is impossible to move it by N places by using :+Ntabmove. For
clarification what +N means in this context see |[range]|.


LOOPING OVER TAB PAGES:

							*:tabd* *:tabdo*
:tabd[o] {cmd}	Execute {cmd} in each tab page.
		It works like doing this: >
			:tabfirst
			:{cmd}
			:tabnext
			:{cmd}
			etc.
<		This only operates in the current window of each tab page.
		When an error is detected on one tab page, further tab pages
		will not be visited.
		The last tab page (or where an error occurred) becomes the
		current tab page.
		{cmd} can contain '|' to concatenate several commands.
		{cmd} must not open or close tab pages or reorder them.
		{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the
		|+listcmds| feature}
		Also see |:windo|, |:argdo| and |:bufdo|.

==============================================================================
3. Other items						*tab-page-other*

							*tabline-menu*
The GUI tab pages line has a popup menu.  It is accessed with a right click.
The entries are:
	Close		Close the tab page under the mouse pointer.  The
			current one if there is no label under the mouse
			pointer.
	New Tab		Open a tab page, editing an empty buffer.  It appears
			to the left of the mouse pointer.
	Open Tab...	Like "New Tab" and additionally use a file selector to
			select a file to edit.

Diff mode works per tab page.  You can see the diffs between several files
within one tab page.  Other tab pages can show differences between other
files.

Variables local to a tab page start with "t:". |tabpage-variable|

Currently there is only one option local to a tab page: 'cmdheight'.

The TabLeave and TabEnter autocommand events can be used to do something when
switching from one tab page to another.  The exact order depends on what you
are doing.  When creating a new tab page this works as if you create a new
window on the same buffer and then edit another buffer.  Thus ":tabnew"
triggers:
	WinLeave		leave current window
	TabLeave		leave current tab page
	TabEnter		enter new tab page
	WinEnter		enter window in new tab page
	BufLeave		leave current buffer
	BufEnter		enter new empty buffer

When switching to another tab page the order is:
	BufLeave
	WinLeave
	TabLeave
	TabEnter
	WinEnter
	BufEnter

==============================================================================
4. Setting 'tabline'					*setting-tabline*

The 'tabline' option specifies what the line with tab pages labels looks like.
It is only used when there is no GUI tab line.

You can use the 'showtabline' option to specify when you want the line with
tab page labels to appear: never, when there is more than one tab page or
always.

The highlighting of the tab pages line is set with the groups TabLine
TabLineSel and TabLineFill.  |hl-TabLine| |hl-TabLineSel| |hl-TabLineFill|

A "+" will be shown for a tab page that has a modified window.  The number of
windows in a tabpage is also shown.  Thus "3+" means three windows and one of
them has a modified buffer.

The 'tabline' option allows you to define your preferred way to tab pages
labels.  This isn't easy, thus an example will be given here.

For basics see the 'statusline' option.  The same items can be used in the
'tabline' option.  Additionally, the |tabpagebuflist()|, |tabpagenr()| and
|tabpagewinnr()| functions are useful.

Since the number of tab labels will vary, you need to use an expression for
the whole option.  Something like: >
	:set tabline=%!MyTabLine()

Then define the MyTabLine() function to list all the tab pages labels.  A
convenient method is to split it in two parts:  First go over all the tab
pages and define labels for them.  Then get the label for each tab page. >

	function MyTabLine()
	  let s = ''
	  for i in range(tabpagenr('$'))
	    " select the highlighting
	    if i + 1 == tabpagenr()
	      let s .= '%#TabLineSel#'
	    else
	      let s .= '%#TabLine#'
	    endif

	    " set the tab page number (for mouse clicks)
	    let s .= '%' . (i + 1) . 'T'

	    " the label is made by MyTabLabel()
	    let s .= ' %{MyTabLabel(' . (i + 1) . ')} '
	  endfor

	  " after the last tab fill with TabLineFill and reset tab page nr
	  let s .= '%#TabLineFill#%T'

	  " right-align the label to close the current tab page
	  if tabpagenr('$') > 1
	    let s .= '%=%#TabLine#%999Xclose'
	  endif

	  return s
	endfunction

Now the MyTabLabel() function is called for each tab page to get its label. >

	function MyTabLabel(n)
	  let buflist = tabpagebuflist(a:n)
	  let winnr = tabpagewinnr(a:n)
	  return bufname(buflist[winnr - 1])
	endfunction

This is just a simplistic example that results in a tab pages line that
resembles the default, but without adding a + for a modified buffer or
truncating the names.  You will want to reduce the width of labels in a
clever way when there is not enough room.  Check the 'columns' option for the
space available.

==============================================================================
5. Setting 'guitablabel'				*setting-guitablabel*

When the GUI tab pages line is displayed, 'guitablabel' can be used to
specify the label to display for each tab page.  Unlike 'tabline', which
specifies the whole tab pages line at once, 'guitablabel' is used for each
label separately.

'guitabtooltip' is very similar and is used for the tooltip of the same label.
This only appears when the mouse pointer hovers over the label, thus it
usually is longer.  Only supported on some systems though.

See the 'statusline' option for the format of the value.

The "%N" item can be used for the current tab page number.  The |v:lnum|
variable is also set to this number when the option is evaluated.
The items that use a file name refer to the current window of the tab page.

Note that syntax highlighting is not used for the option.  The %T and %X
items are also ignored.

A simple example that puts the tab page number and the buffer name in the
label: >
	:set guitablabel=%N\ %f

An example that resembles the default 'guitablabel': Show the number of
windows in the tab page and a '+' if there is a modified buffer: >

	function GuiTabLabel()
	  let label = ''
	  let bufnrlist = tabpagebuflist(v:lnum)

	  " Add '+' if one of the buffers in the tab page is modified
	  for bufnr in bufnrlist
	    if getbufvar(bufnr, "&modified")
	      let label = '+'
	      break
	    endif
	  endfor

	  " Append the number of windows in the tab page if more than one
	  let wincount = tabpagewinnr(v:lnum, '$')
	  if wincount > 1
	    let label .= wincount
	  endif
	  if label != ''
	    let label .= ' '
	  endif

	  " Append the buffer name
	  return label . bufname(bufnrlist[tabpagewinnr(v:lnum) - 1])
	endfunction

	set guitablabel=%{GuiTabLabel()}

Note that the function must be defined before setting the option, otherwise
you get an error message for the function not being known.

If you want to fall back to the default label, return an empty string.

If you want to show something specific for a tab page, you might want to use a
tab page local variable. |t:var|

Tags and special searches				*tags-and-searches*

See section |29.1| of the user manual for an introduction.

1. Jump to a tag		|tag-commands|
2. Tag stack			|tag-stack|
3. Tag match list		|tag-matchlist|
4. Tags details			|tag-details|
5. Tags file format		|tags-file-format|
6. Include file searches	|include-search|

==============================================================================
1. Jump to a tag					*tag-commands*

							*tag* *tags*
A tag is an identifier that appears in a "tags" file.  It is a sort of label
that can be jumped to.  For example: In C programs each function name can be
used as a tag.  The "tags" file has to be generated by a program like ctags,
before the tag commands can be used.

With the ":tag" command the cursor will be positioned on the tag.  With the
CTRL-] command, the keyword on which the cursor is standing is used as the
tag.  If the cursor is not on a keyword, the first keyword to the right of the
cursor is used.

The ":tag" command works very well for C programs.  If you see a call to a
function and wonder what that function does, position the cursor inside of the
function name and hit CTRL-].  This will bring you to the function definition.
An easy way back is with the CTRL-T command.  Also read about the tag stack
below.

						*:ta* *:tag* *E426* *E429*
:[count]ta[g][!] {ident}
			Jump to the definition of {ident}, using the
			information in the tags file(s).  Put {ident} in the
			tag stack.  See |tag-!| for [!].
			{ident} can be a regexp pattern, see |tag-regexp|.
			When there are several matching tags for {ident}, jump
			to the [count] one.  When [count] is omitted the
			first one is jumped to. See |tag-matchlist| for
			jumping to other matching tags.

g<LeftMouse>						*g<LeftMouse>*
<C-LeftMouse>					*<C-LeftMouse>* *CTRL-]*
CTRL-]			Jump to the definition of the keyword under the
			cursor.  Same as ":tag {ident}", where {ident} is the
			keyword under or after cursor.
			When there are several matching tags for {ident}, jump
			to the [count] one.  When no [count] is given the
			first one is jumped to. See |tag-matchlist| for
			jumping to other matching tags.
			{Vi: identifier after the cursor}

							*v_CTRL-]*
{Visual}CTRL-]		Same as ":tag {ident}", where {ident} is the text that
			is highlighted.  {not in Vi}

							*telnet-CTRL-]*
CTRL-] is the default telnet escape key.  When you type CTRL-] to jump to a
tag, you will get the telnet prompt instead.  Most versions of telnet allow
changing or disabling the default escape key.  See the telnet man page.  You
can 'telnet -E {Hostname}' to disable the escape character, or 'telnet -e
{EscapeCharacter} {Hostname}' to specify another escape character.  If
possible, try to use "ssh" instead of "telnet" to avoid this problem.

							*tag-priority*
When there are multiple matches for a tag, this priority is used:
1. "FSC"  A full matching static tag for the current file.
2. "F C"  A full matching global tag for the current file.
3. "F  "  A full matching global tag for another file.
4. "FS "  A full matching static tag for another file.
5. " SC"  An ignore-case matching static tag for the current file.
6. "  C"  An ignore-case matching global tag for the current file.
7. "   "  An ignore-case matching global tag for another file.
8. " S "  An ignore-case matching static tag for another file.

Note that when the current file changes, the priority list is mostly not
changed, to avoid confusion when using ":tnext".  It is changed when using
":tag {ident}".

The ignore-case matches are not found for a ":tag" command when the
'ignorecase' option is off.  They are found when a pattern is used (starting
with a "/") and for ":tselect", also when 'ignorecase' is off.  Note that
using ignore-case tag searching disables binary searching in the tags file,
which causes a slowdown.  This can be avoided by fold-case sorting the tag
file.  See the 'tagbsearch' option for an explanation.

2. Tag stack				*tag-stack* *tagstack* *E425*

On the tag stack is remembered which tags you jumped to, and from where.
Tags are only pushed onto the stack when the 'tagstack' option is set.

g<RightMouse>						*g<RightMouse>*
<C-RightMouse>					*<C-RightMouse>* *CTRL-T*
CTRL-T			Jump to [count] older entry in the tag stack
			(default 1).  {not in Vi}

						*:po* *:pop* *E555* *E556*
:[count]po[p][!]	Jump to [count] older entry in tag stack (default 1).
			See |tag-!| for [!].  {not in Vi}

:[count]ta[g][!]	Jump to [count] newer entry in tag stack (default 1).
			See |tag-!| for [!].  {not in Vi}

							*:tags*
:tags			Show the contents of the tag stack.  The active
			entry is marked with a '>'.  {not in Vi}

The output of ":tags" looks like this:

   # TO tag      FROM line  in file/text
   1  1 main		 1  harddisk2:text/vim/test
 > 2  2 FuncA		58  i = FuncA(10);
   3  1 FuncC	       357  harddisk2:text/vim/src/amiga.c

This list shows the tags that you jumped to and the cursor position before
that jump.  The older tags are at the top, the newer at the bottom.

The '>' points to the active entry.  This is the tag that will be used by the
next ":tag" command.  The CTRL-T and ":pop" command will use the position
above the active entry.

Below the "TO" is the number of the current match in the match list.  Note
that this doesn't change when using ":pop" or ":tag".

The line number and file name are remembered to be able to get back to where
you were before the tag command.  The line number will be correct, also when
deleting/inserting lines, unless this was done by another program (e.g.
another instance of Vim).

For the current file, the "file/text" column shows the text at the position.
An indent is removed and a long line is truncated to fit in the window.

You can jump to previously used tags with several commands.  Some examples:

	":pop" or CTRL-T	to position before previous tag
	{count}CTRL-T		to position before {count} older tag
	":tag"			to newer tag
	":0tag"			to last used tag

The most obvious way to use this is while browsing through the call graph of
a program.  Consider the following call graph:

	main  --->  FuncA  --->  FuncC
	      --->  FuncB

(Explanation: main calls FuncA and FuncB; FuncA calls FuncC).
You can get from main to FuncA by using CTRL-] on the call to FuncA.  Then
you can CTRL-] to get to FuncC.  If you now want to go back to main you can
use CTRL-T twice.  Then you can CTRL-] to FuncB.

If you issue a ":ta {ident}" or CTRL-] command, this tag is inserted at the
current position in the stack.  If the stack was full (it can hold up to 20
entries), the oldest entry is deleted and the older entries shift one
position up (their index number is decremented by one).  If the last used
entry was not at the bottom, the entries below the last used one are
deleted.  This means that an old branch in the call graph is lost.  After the
commands explained above the tag stack will look like this:

   # TO tag	FROM line  in file/text
   1  1 main		1  harddisk2:text/vim/test
   2  1 FuncB	       59  harddisk2:text/vim/src/main.c

							*E73*
When you try to use the tag stack while it doesn't contain anything you will
get an error message.

==============================================================================
3. Tag match list				*tag-matchlist* *E427* *E428*

When there are several matching tags, these commands can be used to jump
between them.  Note that these commands don't change the tag stack, they keep
the same entry.

							*:ts* *:tselect*
:ts[elect][!] [ident]	List the tags that match [ident], using the
			information in the tags file(s).
			When [ident] is not given, the last tag name from the
			tag stack is used.
			With a '>' in the first column is indicated which is
			the current position in the list (if there is one).
			[ident] can be a regexp pattern, see |tag-regexp|.
			See |tag-priority| for the priorities used in the
			listing.  {not in Vi}
			Example output:

>
	 nr pri kind tag		file
	  1 F	f    mch_delay		os_amiga.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	> 2 F	f    mch_delay		os_msdos.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	  3 F	f    mch_delay		os_unix.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	Enter nr of choice (<CR> to abort):
<
			See |tag-priority| for the "pri" column.  Note that
			this depends on the current file, thus using
			":tselect xxx" can produce different results.
			The "kind" column gives the kind of tag, if this was
			included in the tags file.
			The "info" column shows information that could be
			found in the tags file.  It depends on the program
			that produced the tags file.
			When the list is long, you may get the |more-prompt|.
			If you already see the tag you want to use, you can
			type 'q' and enter the number.

							*:sts* *:stselect*
:sts[elect][!] [ident]	Does ":tselect[!] [ident]" and splits the window for
			the selected tag.  {not in Vi}

							*g]*
g]			Like CTRL-], but use ":tselect" instead of ":tag".
			{not in Vi}

							*v_g]*
{Visual}g]		Same as "g]", but use the highlighted text as the
			identifier.  {not in Vi}

							*:tj* *:tjump*
:tj[ump][!] [ident]	Like ":tselect", but jump to the tag directly when
			there is only one match.  {not in Vi}

							*:stj* *:stjump*
:stj[ump][!] [ident]	Does ":tjump[!] [ident]" and splits the window for the
			selected tag.  {not in Vi}

							*g_CTRL-]*
g CTRL-]		Like CTRL-], but use ":tjump" instead of ":tag".
			{not in Vi}

							*v_g_CTRL-]*
{Visual}g CTRL-]	Same as "g CTRL-]", but use the highlighted text as
			the identifier.  {not in Vi}

							*:tn* *:tnext*
:[count]tn[ext][!]	Jump to [count] next matching tag (default 1).  See
			|tag-!| for [!].  {not in Vi}

							*:tp* *:tprevious*
:[count]tp[revious][!]	Jump to [count] previous matching tag (default 1).
			See |tag-!| for [!].  {not in Vi}

							*:tN* *:tNext*
:[count]tN[ext][!]	Same as ":tprevious".  {not in Vi}

							*:tr* *:trewind*
:[count]tr[ewind][!]	Jump to first matching tag.  If [count] is given, jump
			to [count]th matching tag.  See |tag-!| for [!].  {not
			in Vi}

							*:tf* *:tfirst*
:[count]tf[irst][!]	Same as ":trewind".  {not in Vi}

							*:tl* *:tlast*
:tl[ast][!]		Jump to last matching tag.  See |tag-!| for [!].  {not
			in Vi}

							*:lt* *:ltag*
:lt[ag][!] [ident]	Jump to tag [ident] and add the matching tags to a new
			location list for the current window.  [ident] can be
			a regexp pattern, see |tag-regexp|.  When [ident] is
			not given, the last tag name from the tag stack is
			used.  The search pattern to locate the tag line is
			prefixed with "\V" to escape all the special
			characters (very nomagic). The location list showing
			the matching tags is independent of the tag stack.
			See |tag-!| for [!].
			{not in Vi}

When there is no other message, Vim shows which matching tag has been jumped
to, and the number of matching tags: >
	tag 1 of 3 or more
The " or more" is used to indicate that Vim didn't try all the tags files yet.
When using ":tnext" a few times, or with ":tlast", more matches may be found.

When you didn't see this message because of some other message, or you just
want to know where you are, this command will show it again (and jump to the
same tag as last time): >
	:0tn
<
							*tag-skip-file*
When a matching tag is found for which the file doesn't exist, this match is
skipped and the next matching tag is used.  Vim reports this, to notify you of
missing files.  When the end of the list of matches has been reached, an error
message is given.

							*tag-preview*
The tag match list can also be used in the preview window.  The commands are
the same as above, with a "p" prepended.
{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix| feature}

							*:pts* *:ptselect*
:pts[elect][!] [ident]	Does ":tselect[!] [ident]" and shows the new tag in a
			"Preview" window.  See |:ptag| for more info.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ptj* *:ptjump*
:ptj[ump][!] [ident]	Does ":tjump[!] [ident]" and shows the new tag in a
			"Preview" window.  See |:ptag| for more info.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ptn* *:ptnext*
:[count]ptn[ext][!]	":tnext" in the preview window.  See |:ptag|.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ptp* *:ptprevious*
:[count]ptp[revious][!]	":tprevious" in the preview window.  See |:ptag|.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ptN* *:ptNext*
:[count]ptN[ext][!]	Same as ":ptprevious".  {not in Vi}

							*:ptr* *:ptrewind*
:[count]ptr[ewind][!]	":trewind" in the preview window.  See |:ptag|.
			{not in Vi}

							*:ptf* *:ptfirst*
:[count]ptf[irst][!]	Same as ":ptrewind".  {not in Vi}

							*:ptl* *:ptlast*
:ptl[ast][!]		":tlast" in the preview window.  See |:ptag|.
			{not in Vi}

==============================================================================
4. Tags details						*tag-details*

							*static-tag*
A static tag is a tag that is defined for a specific file.  In a C program
this could be a static function.

In Vi jumping to a tag sets the current search pattern.  This means that
the "n" command after jumping to a tag does not search for the same pattern
that it did before jumping to the tag.  Vim does not do this as we consider it
to be a bug.  You can still find the tag search pattern in the search history.
If you really want the old Vi behavior, set the 't' flag in 'cpoptions'.

							*tag-binary-search*
Vim uses binary searching in the tags file to find the desired tag quickly
(when enabled at compile time |+tag_binary|).  But this only works if the
tags file was sorted on ASCII byte value.  Therefore, if no match was found,
another try is done with a linear search.  If you only want the linear search,
reset the 'tagbsearch' option.  Or better: Sort the tags file!

Note that the binary searching is disabled when not looking for a tag with a
specific name.  This happens when ignoring case and when a regular expression
is used that doesn't start with a fixed string.  Tag searching can be a lot
slower then.  The former can be avoided by case-fold sorting the tags file.
See 'tagbsearch' for details.

							*tag-regexp*
The ":tag" and ":tselect" commands accept a regular expression argument.  See
|pattern| for the special characters that can be used.
When the argument starts with '/', it is used as a pattern.  If the argument
does not start with '/', it is taken literally, as a full tag name.
Examples: >
    :tag main
<	jumps to the tag "main" that has the highest priority. >
    :tag /^get
<	jumps to the tag that starts with "get" and has the highest priority. >
    :tag /norm
<	lists all the tags that contain "norm", including "id_norm".
When the argument both exists literally, and match when used as a regexp, a
literal match has a higher priority.  For example, ":tag /open" matches "open"
before "open_file" and "file_open".
When using a pattern case is ignored.  If you want to match case use "\C" in
the pattern.

							*tag-!*
If the tag is in the current file this will always work.  Otherwise the
performed actions depend on whether the current file was changed, whether a !
is added to the command and on the 'autowrite' option:

  tag in       file	   autowrite			~
current file  changed	!   option	  action	~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    yes		 x	x     x	  goto tag
    no		 no	x     x	  read other file, goto tag
    no		yes    yes    x   abandon current file, read other file, goto
				  tag
    no		yes	no    on  write current file, read other file, goto
				  tag
    no		yes	no   off  fail
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If the tag is in the current file, the command will always work.
- If the tag is in another file and the current file was not changed, the
  other file will be made the current file and read into the buffer.
- If the tag is in another file, the current file was changed and a ! is
  added to the command, the changes to the current file are lost, the other
  file will be made the current file and read into the buffer.
- If the tag is in another file, the current file was changed and the
  'autowrite' option is on, the current file will be written, the other
  file will be made the current file and read into the buffer.
- If the tag is in another file, the current file was changed and the
  'autowrite' option is off, the command will fail.  If you want to save
  the changes, use the ":w" command and then use ":tag" without an argument.
  This works because the tag is put on the stack anyway.  If you want to lose
  the changes you can use the ":tag!" command.

							*tag-security*
Note that Vim forbids some commands, for security reasons.  This works like
using the 'secure' option for exrc/vimrc files in the current directory.  See
|trojan-horse| and |sandbox|.
When the {tagaddress} changes a buffer, you will get a warning message:
	"WARNING: tag command changed a buffer!!!"
In a future version changing the buffer will be impossible.  All this for
security reasons: Somebody might hide a nasty command in the tags file, which
would otherwise go unnoticed.  Example: >
	:$d|/tag-function-name/
{this security prevention is not present in Vi}

In Vi the ":tag" command sets the last search pattern when the tag is searched
for.  In Vim this is not done, the previous search pattern is still remembered,
unless the 't' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.  The search pattern is always
put in the search history, so you can modify it if searching fails.

					*emacs-tags* *emacs_tags* *E430*
Emacs style tag files are only supported if Vim was compiled with the
|+emacs_tags| feature enabled.  Sorry, there is no explanation about Emacs tag
files here, it is only supported for backwards compatibility :-).

Lines in Emacs tags files can be very long.  Vim only deals with lines of up
to about 510 bytes.  To see whether lines are ignored set 'verbose' to 5 or
higher.

							*tags-option*
The 'tags' option is a list of file names.  Each of these files is searched
for the tag.  This can be used to use a different tags file than the default
file "tags".  It can also be used to access a common tags file.

The next file in the list is not used when:
- A matching static tag for the current buffer has been found.
- A matching global tag has been found.
This also depends on the 'ignorecase' option.  If it is off, and the tags file
only has a match without matching case, the next tags file is searched for a
match with matching case.  If no tag with matching case is found, the first
match without matching case is used.  If 'ignorecase' is on, and a matching
global tag with or without matching case is found, this one is used, no
further tags files are searched.

When a tag file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path of
the current file.  This makes it possible to use a tags file in the directory
where the current file is (no matter what the current directory is).  The idea
of using "./" is that you can define which tag file is searched first: In the
current directory ("tags,./tags") or in the directory of the current file
("./tags,tags").

For example: >
	:set tags=./tags,tags,/home/user/commontags

In this example the tag will first be searched for in the file "tags" in the
directory where the current file is.  Next the "tags" file in the current
directory.  If it is not found there, then the file "/home/user/commontags"
will be searched for the tag.

This can be switched off by including the 'd' flag in 'cpoptions', to make
it Vi compatible.  "./tags" will then be the tags file in the current
directory, instead of the tags file in the directory where the current file
is.

Instead of the comma a space may be used.  Then a backslash is required for
the space to be included in the string option: >
	:set tags=tags\ /home/user/commontags

To include a space in a file name use three backslashes.  To include a comma
in a file name use two backslashes.  For example, use: >
	:set tags=tag\\\ file,/home/user/common\\,tags

for the files "tag file" and "/home/user/common,tags".  The 'tags' option will
have the value "tag\ file,/home/user/common\,tags".

If the 'tagrelative' option is on (which is the default) and using a tag file
in another directory, file names in that tag file are relative to the
directory where the tag file is.

==============================================================================
5. Tags file format				*tags-file-format* *E431*

						*ctags* *jtags*
A tags file can be created with an external command, for example "ctags".  It
will contain a tag for each function.  Some versions of "ctags" will also make
a tag for each "#defined" macro, typedefs, enums, etc.

Some programs that generate tags files:
ctags			As found on most Unix systems.  Only supports C.  Only
			does the basic work.
							*Exuberant_ctags*
exuberant ctags		This a very good one.  It works for C, C++, Java,
			Fortran, Eiffel and others.  It can generate tags for
			many items.  See http://ctags.sourceforge.net.
etags			Connected to Emacs.  Supports many languages.
JTags			For Java, in Java.  It can be found at
			http://www.fleiner.com/jtags/.
ptags.py		For Python, in Python.  Found in your Python source
			directory at Tools/scripts/ptags.py.
ptags			For Perl, in Perl.  It can be found at
			http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/nthiery/Tags/.
gnatxref		For Ada.  See http://www.gnuada.org/.  gnatxref is
			part of the gnat package.


The lines in the tags file must have one of these three formats:

1.  {tagname}		{TAB} {tagfile} {TAB} {tagaddress}
2.  {tagfile}:{tagname} {TAB} {tagfile} {TAB} {tagaddress}
3.  {tagname}		{TAB} {tagfile} {TAB} {tagaddress} {term} {field} ..

The first is a normal tag, which is completely compatible with Vi.  It is the
only format produced by traditional ctags implementations.  This is often used
for functions that are global, also referenced in other files.

The lines in the tags file can end in <LF> or <CR><LF>.  On the Macintosh <CR>
also works.  The <CR> and <NL> characters can never appear inside a line.

							*tag-old-static*
The second format is for a static tag only.  It is obsolete now, replaced by
the third format.  It is only supported by Elvis 1.x and Vim and a few
versions of ctags.  A static tag is often used for functions that are local,
only referenced in the file {tagfile}.  Note that for the static tag, the two
occurrences of {tagfile} must be exactly the same.  Also see |tags-option|
below, for how static tags are used.

The third format is new.  It includes additional information in optional
fields at the end of each line.  It is backwards compatible with Vi.  It is
only supported by new versions of ctags (such as Exuberant ctags).

{tagname}	The identifier.  Normally the name of a function, but it can
		be any identifier.  It cannot contain a <Tab>.
{TAB}		One <Tab> character.  Note: previous versions allowed any
		white space here.  This has been abandoned to allow spaces in
		{tagfile}.  It can be re-enabled by including the
		|+tag_any_white| feature at compile time. *tag-any-white*
{tagfile}	The file that contains the definition of {tagname}.  It can
		have an absolute or relative path.  It may contain environment
		variables and wildcards (although the use of wildcards is
		doubtful).  It cannot contain a <Tab>.
{tagaddress}	The Ex command that positions the cursor on the tag.  It can
		be any Ex command, although restrictions apply (see
		|tag-security|).  Posix only allows line numbers and search
		commands, which are mostly used.
{term}		;" The two characters semicolon and double quote.  This is
		interpreted by Vi as the start of a comment, which makes the
		following be ignored.  This is for backwards compatibility
		with Vi, it ignores the following fields.
{field} ..	A list of optional fields.  Each field has the form:

			<Tab>{fieldname}:{value}

		The {fieldname} identifies the field, and can only contain
		alphabetical characters [a-zA-Z].
		The {value} is any string, but cannot contain a <Tab>.
		These characters are special:
			"\t" stands for a <Tab>
			"\r" stands for a <CR>
			"\n" stands for a <NL>
			"\\" stands for a single '\' character

		There is one field that doesn't have a ':'.  This is the kind
		of the tag.  It is handled like it was preceded with "kind:".
		See the documentation of ctags for the kinds it produces.

		The only other field currently recognized by Vim is "file:"
		(with an empty value).  It is used for a static tag.

The first lines in the tags file can contain lines that start with
	!_TAG_
These are sorted to the first lines, only rare tags that start with "!" can
sort to before them.  Vim recognizes two items.  The first one is the line
that indicates if the file was sorted.  When this line is found, Vim uses
binary searching for the tags file:
	!_TAG_FILE_SORTED<Tab>1<Tab>{anything} ~

A tag file may be case-fold sorted to avoid a linear search when 'ignorecase'
is on.  See 'tagbsearch' for details.  The value '2' should be used then:
	!_TAG_FILE_SORTED<Tab>2<Tab>{anything} ~

The other tag that Vim recognizes, but only when compiled with the
|+multi_byte| feature, is the encoding of the tags file:
	!_TAG_FILE_ENCODING<Tab>utf-8<Tab>{anything} ~
Here "utf-8" is the encoding used for the tags.  Vim will then convert the tag
being searched for from 'encoding' to the encoding of the tags file.  And when
listing tags the reverse happens.  When the conversion fails the unconverted
tag is used.

							*tag-search*
The command can be any Ex command, but often it is a search command.
Examples:
	tag1	file1	/^main(argc, argv)/ ~
	tag2	file2	108 ~

The command is always executed with 'magic' not set.  The only special
characters in a search pattern are "^" (begin-of-line) and "$" (<EOL>).
See |pattern|.  Note that you must put a backslash before each backslash in
the search text.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vi.

							*E434* *E435*
If the command is a normal search command (it starts and ends with "/" or
"?"), some special handling is done:
- Searching starts on line 1 of the file.
  The direction of the search is forward for "/", backward for "?".
  Note that 'wrapscan' does not matter, the whole file is always searched.  (Vi
  does use 'wrapscan', which caused tags sometimes not be found.)  {Vi starts
  searching in line 2 of another file.  It does not find a tag in line 1 of
  another file when 'wrapscan' is not set}
- If the search fails, another try is done ignoring case.  If that fails too,
  a search is done for:
	"^tagname[ \t]*("
  (the tag with '^' prepended and "[ \t]*(" appended).  When using function
  names, this will find the function name when it is in column 0.  This will
  help when the arguments to the function have changed since the tags file was
  made.  If this search also fails another search is done with:
	"^[#a-zA-Z_].*\<tagname[ \t]*("
  This means: A line starting with '#' or an identifier and containing the tag
  followed by white space and a '('.  This will find macro names and function
  names with a type prepended.  {the extra searches are not in Vi}

==============================================================================
6. Include file searches		*include-search* *definition-search*
							*E387* *E388* *E389*

These commands look for a string in the current file and in all encountered
included files (recursively).  This can be used to find the definition of a
variable, function or macro.  If you only want to search in the current
buffer, use the commands listed at |pattern-searches|.

These commands are not available when the |+find_in_path| feature was disabled
at compile time.

When a line is encountered that includes another file, that file is searched
before continuing in the current buffer.  Files included by included files are
also searched.  When an include file could not be found it is silently
ignored.  Use the |:checkpath| command to discover which files could not be
found, possibly your 'path' option is not set up correctly.  Note: the
included file is searched, not a buffer that may be editing that file.  Only
for the current file the lines in the buffer are used.

The string can be any keyword or a defined macro.  For the keyword any match
will be found.  For defined macros only lines that match with the 'define'
option will be found.  The default is "^#\s*define", which is for C programs.
For other languages you probably want to change this.  See 'define' for an
example for C++.  The string cannot contain an end-of-line, only matches
within a line are found.

When a match is found for a defined macro, the displaying of lines continues
with the next line when a line ends in a backslash.

The commands that start with "[" start searching from the start of the current
file.  The commands that start with "]" start at the current cursor position.

The 'include' option is used to define a line that includes another file.  The
default is "\^#\s*include", which is for C programs.  Note: Vim does not
recognize C syntax, if the 'include' option matches a line inside
"#ifdef/#endif" or inside a comment, it is searched anyway.  The 'isfname'
option is used to recognize the file name that comes after the matched
pattern.

The 'path' option is used to find the directory for the include files that
do not have an absolute path.

The 'comments' option is used for the commands that display a single line or
jump to a line.  It defines patterns that may start a comment.  Those lines
are ignored for the search, unless [!] is used.  One exception: When the line
matches the pattern "^# *define" it is not considered to be a comment.

If you want to list matches, and then select one to jump to, you could use a
mapping to do that for you.  Here is an example: >

  :map <F4> [I:let nr = input("Which one: ")<Bar>exe "normal " . nr ."[\t"<CR>
<
							*[i*
[i			Display the first line that contains the keyword
			under the cursor.  The search starts at the beginning
			of the file.  Lines that look like a comment are
			ignored (see 'comments' option).  If a count is given,
			the count'th matching line is displayed, and comment
			lines are not ignored.  {not in Vi}

							*]i*
]i			like "[i", but start at the current cursor position.
			{not in Vi}

							*:is* *:isearch*
:[range]is[earch][!] [count] [/]pattern[/]
			Like "[i"  and "]i", but search in [range] lines
			(default: whole file).
			See |:search-args| for [/] and [!].  {not in Vi}

							*[I*

								*:search-args*
Common arguments for the commands above:
[!]   When included, find matches in lines that are recognized as comments.
      When excluded, a match is ignored when the line is recognized as a
      comment (according to 'comments'), or the match is in a C comment (after
      "//" or inside /* */).  Note that a match may be missed if a line is
      recognized as a comment, but the comment ends halfway the line.
      And  if the line is a comment, but it is not recognized (according to
      'comments') a match may be found in it anyway.  Example: >
		/* comment
		   foobar */
<     A match for "foobar" is found, because this line is not recognized as a
      comment (even though syntax highlighting does recognize it).
      Note: Since a macro definition mostly doesn't look like a comment, the
      [!] makes no difference for ":dlist", ":dsearch" and ":djump".
[/]   A pattern can be surrounded by '/'.  Without '/' only whole words are
      matched, using the pattern "\<pattern\>".  Only after the second '/' a
      next command can be appended with '|'.  Example: >
	:isearch /string/ | echo "the last one"
<     For a ":djump", ":dsplit", ":dlist" and ":dsearch" command the pattern
      is used as a literal string, not as a search pattern.

Terminal information					*terminal-info*

Vim uses information about the terminal you are using to fill the screen and
recognize what keys you hit.  If this information is not correct, the screen
may be messed up or keys may not be recognized.  The actions which have to be
performed on the screen are accomplished by outputting a string of
characters.  Special keys produce a string of characters.  These strings are
stored in the terminal options, see |terminal-options|.

NOTE: Most of this is not used when running the |GUI|.

1. Startup			|startup-terminal|
2. Terminal options		|terminal-options|
3. Window size			|window-size|
4. Slow and fast terminals	|slow-fast-terminal|
5. Using the mouse		|mouse-using|

==============================================================================
1. Startup						*startup-terminal*

When Vim is started a default terminal type is assumed.  For the Amiga this is
a standard CLI window, for MS-DOS the pc terminal, for Unix an ansi terminal.
A few other terminal types are always available, see below |builtin-terms|.

You can give the terminal name with the '-T' Vim argument.  If it is not given
Vim will try to get the name from the TERM environment variable.

				*termcap* *terminfo* *E557* *E558* *E559*
On Unix the terminfo database or termcap file is used.  This is referred to as
"termcap" in all the documentation.  At compile time, when running configure,
the choice whether to use terminfo or termcap is done automatically.  When
running Vim the output of ":version" will show |+terminfo| if terminfo is
used.  Also see |xterm-screens|.

On non-Unix systems a termcap is only available if Vim was compiled with
TERMCAP defined.

					*builtin-terms* *builtin_terms*
Which builtin terminals are available depends on a few defines in feature.h,
which need to be set at compile time:
    define		output of ":version"	terminals builtin	~
NO_BUILTIN_TCAPS	-builtin_terms		none
SOME_BUILTIN_TCAPS	+builtin_terms		most common ones (default)
ALL_BUILTIN_TCAPS	++builtin_terms		all available

You can see a list of available builtin terminals with ":set term=xxx" (when
not running the GUI).  Also see |+builtin_terms|.

If the termcap code is included Vim will try to get the strings for the
terminal you are using from the termcap file and the builtin termcaps.  Both
are always used, if an entry for the terminal you are using is present.  Which
one is used first depends on the 'ttybuiltin' option:

'ttybuiltin' on		1: builtin termcap	2: external termcap
'ttybuiltin' off	1: external termcap	2: builtin termcap

If an option is missing in one of them, it will be obtained from the other
one.  If an option is present in both, the one first encountered is used.

Which external termcap file is used varies from system to system and may
depend on the environment variables "TERMCAP" and "TERMPATH".  See "man
tgetent".

Settings depending on terminal			*term-dependent-settings*

If you want to set options or mappings, depending on the terminal name, you
can do this best in your .vimrc.  Example: >

   if &term == "xterm"
     ... xterm maps and settings ...
   elseif &term =~ "vt10."
     ... vt100, vt102 maps and settings ...
   endif
<
						*raw-terminal-mode*
For normal editing the terminal will be put into "raw" mode.  The strings
defined with 't_ti' and 't_ks' will be sent to the terminal.  Normally this
puts the terminal in a state where the termcap codes are valid and activates
the cursor and function keys.  When Vim exits the terminal will be put back
into the mode it was before Vim started.  The strings defined with 't_te' and
't_ke' will be sent to the terminal.  On the Amiga, with commands that execute
an external command (e.g., "!!"), the terminal will be put into Normal mode
for a moment.  This means that you can stop the output to the screen by
hitting a printing key.  Output resumes when you hit <BS>.

							*cs7-problem*
Note: If the terminal settings are changed after running Vim, you might have
an illegal combination of settings.  This has been reported on Solaris 2.5
with "stty cs8 parenb", which is restored as "stty cs7 parenb".  Use
"stty cs8 -parenb -istrip" instead, this is restored correctly.

Some termcap entries are wrong in the sense that after sending 't_ks' the
cursor keys send codes different from the codes defined in the termcap.  To
avoid this you can set 't_ks' (and 't_ke') to empty strings.  This must be
done during initialization (see |initialization|), otherwise it's too late.

Some termcap entries assume that the highest bit is always reset.  For
example: The cursor-up entry for the Amiga could be ":ku=\E[A:".  But the
Amiga really sends "\233A".  This works fine if the highest bit is reset,
e.g., when using an Amiga over a serial line.  If the cursor keys don't work,
try the entry ":ku=\233A:".

Some termcap entries have the entry ":ku=\E[A:".  But the Amiga really sends
"\233A".  On output "\E[" and "\233" are often equivalent, on input they
aren't.  You will have to change the termcap entry, or change the key code with
the :set command to fix this.

Many cursor key codes start with an <Esc>.  Vim must find out if this is a
single hit of the <Esc> key or the start of a cursor key sequence.  It waits
for a next character to arrive.  If it does not arrive within one second a
single <Esc> is assumed.  On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor
keys not to work sometimes.  If you discover this problem reset the 'timeout'
option.  Vim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.  If
you want to enter a single <Esc> you must type it twice.  Resetting the
'esckeys' option avoids this problem in Insert mode, but you lose the
possibility to use cursor and function keys in Insert mode.

On the Amiga the recognition of window resizing is activated only when the
terminal name is "amiga" or "builtin_amiga".

Some terminals have confusing codes for the cursor keys.  The televideo 925 is
such a terminal.  It sends a CTRL-H for cursor-left.  This would make it
impossible to distinguish a backspace and cursor-left.  To avoid this problem
CTRL-H is never recognized as cursor-left.

					*vt100-cursor-keys* *xterm-cursor-keys*
Other terminals (e.g., vt100 and xterm) have cursor keys that send <Esc>OA,
<Esc>OB, etc.  Unfortunately these are valid commands in insert mode: Stop
insert, Open a new line above the new one, start inserting 'A', 'B', etc.
Instead of performing these commands Vim will erroneously recognize this typed
key sequence as a cursor key movement.  To avoid this and make Vim do what you
want in either case you could use these settings: >
	:set notimeout		" don't timeout on mappings
	:set ttimeout		" do timeout on terminal key codes
	:set timeoutlen=100	" timeout after 100 msec
This requires the key-codes to be sent within 100 msec in order to recognize
them as a cursor key.  When you type you normally are not that fast, so they
are recognized as individual typed commands, even though Vim receives the same
sequence of bytes.

				*vt100-function-keys* *xterm-function-keys*
An xterm can send function keys F1 to F4 in two modes: vt100 compatible or
not.  Because Vim may not know what the xterm is sending, both types of keys
are recognized.  The same happens for the <Home> and <End> keys.
			normal			vt100 ~
	<F1>	t_k1	<Esc>[11~	<xF1>	<Esc>OP	    *<xF1>-xterm*
	<F2>	t_k2	<Esc>[12~	<xF2>	<Esc>OQ	    *<xF2>-xterm*
	<F3>	t_k3	<Esc>[13~	<xF3>	<Esc>OR	    *<xF3>-xterm*
	<F4>	t_k4	<Esc>[14~	<xF4>	<Esc>OS	    *<xF4>-xterm*
	<Home>	t_kh	<Esc>[7~	<xHome>	<Esc>OH	    *<xHome>-xterm*
	<End>	t_@7	<Esc>[4~	<xEnd>	<Esc>OF	    *<xEnd>-xterm*

When Vim starts, <xF1> is mapped to <F1>, <xF2> to <F2> etc.  This means that
by default both codes do the same thing.  If you make a mapping for <xF2>,
because your terminal does have two keys, the default mapping is overwritten,
thus you can use the <F2> and <xF2> keys for something different.

							*xterm-shifted-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support shifted function keys and special keys.  Vim
recognizes most of them.  Use ":set termcap" to check which are supported and
what the codes are.  Mostly these are not in a termcap, they are only
supported by the builtin_xterm termcap.

							*xterm-modifier-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support Alt and Ctrl for most function keys.  To avoid
having to add all combinations of Alt, Ctrl and Shift for every key a special
sequence is recognized at the end of a termcap entry: ";*X".  The "X" can be
any character, often '~' is used.  The ";*" stands for an optional modifier
argument.  ";2" is Shift, ";3" is Alt, ";5" is Ctrl and ";9" is Meta (when
it's different from Alt).  They can be combined.  Examples: >
	:set <F8>=^[[19;*~
	:set <Home>=^[[1;*H
Another speciality about these codes is that they are not overwritten by
another code.  That is to avoid that the codes obtained from xterm directly
|t_RV| overwrite them.
							*xterm-scroll-region*
The default termcap entry for xterm on Sun and other platforms does not
contain the entry for scroll regions.  Add ":cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:" to the xterm
entry in /etc/termcap and everything should work.

							*xterm-end-home-keys*
On some systems (at least on FreeBSD with XFree86 3.1.2) the codes that the
<End> and <Home> keys send contain a <Nul> character.  To make these keys send
the proper key code, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults file:

*VT100.Translations:		#override \n\
		<Key>Home: string("0x1b") string("[7~") \n\
		<Key>End: string("0x1b") string("[8~")

						*xterm-8bit* *xterm-8-bit*
Xterm can be run in a mode where it uses 8-bit escape sequences.  The CSI code
is used instead of <Esc>[.  The advantage is that an <Esc> can quickly be
recognized in Insert mode, because it can't be confused with the start of a
special key.
For the builtin termcap entries, Vim checks if the 'term' option contains
"8bit" anywhere.  It then uses 8-bit characters for the termcap entries, the
mouse and a few other things.  You would normally set $TERM in your shell to
"xterm-8bit" and Vim picks this up and adjusts to the 8-bit setting
automatically.
When Vim receives a response to the |t_RV| (request version) sequence and it
starts with CSI, it assumes that the terminal is in 8-bit mode and will
convert all key sequences to their 8-bit variants.

==============================================================================
2. Terminal options		*terminal-options* *termcap-options* *E436*

The terminal options can be set just like normal options.  But they are not
shown with the ":set all" command.  Instead use ":set termcap".

It is always possible to change individual strings by setting the
appropriate option.  For example: >
	:set t_ce=^V^[[K	(CTRL-V, <Esc>, [, K)

{Vi: no terminal options.  You have to exit Vi, edit the termcap entry and
try again}

The options are listed below.  The associated termcap code is always equal to
the last two characters of the option name.  Only one termcap code is
required: Cursor motion, 't_cm'.

The options 't_da', 't_db', 't_ms', 't_xs' represent flags in the termcap.
When the termcap flag is present, the option will be set to "y".  But any
non-empty string means that the flag is set.  An empty string means that the
flag is not set.  't_CS' works like this too, but it isn't a termcap flag.

Note about t_so and t_mr: When the termcap entry "so" is not present the
entry for "mr" is used.  And vice versa.  The same is done for "se" and "me".
If your terminal supports both inversion and standout mode, you can see two
different modes.  If your terminal supports only one of the modes, both will
look the same.

							*keypad-comma*
The keypad keys, when they are not mapped, behave like the equivalent normal
key.  There is one exception: if you have a comma on the keypad instead of a
decimal point, Vim will use a dot anyway.  Use these mappings to fix that: >
	:noremap <kPoint> ,
	:noremap! <kPoint> ,
<							*xterm-codes*
There is a special trick to obtain the key codes which currently only works
for xterm.  When |t_RV| is defined and a response is received which indicates
an xterm with patchlevel 141 or higher, Vim uses special escape sequences to
request the key codes directly from the xterm.  The responses are used to
adjust the various t_ codes.  This avoids the problem that the xterm can
produce different codes, depending on the mode it is in (8-bit, VT102,
VT220, etc.).  The result is that codes like <xF1> are no longer needed.
Note: This is only done on startup.  If the xterm options are changed after
Vim has started, the escape sequences may not be recognized any more.

							*xterm-resize*
Window resizing with xterm only works if the allowWindowOps resource is
enabled.  On some systems and versions of xterm it's disabled by default
because someone thought it would be a security issue.  It's not clear if this
is actually the case.

To overrule the default, put this line in your ~/.Xdefaults or
~/.Xresources:
>
	XTerm*allowWindowOps: 		true

And run "xrdb -merge .Xresources" to make it effective.  You can check the
value with the context menu (right mouse button while CTRL key is pressed),
there should be a tick at allow-window-ops.

							*termcap-colors*
Note about colors: The 't_Co' option tells Vim the number of colors available.
When it is non-zero, the 't_AB' and 't_AF' options are used to set the color.
If one of these is not available, 't_Sb' and 't_Sf' are used.  't_me' is used
to reset to the default colors.

				*termcap-cursor-shape* *termcap-cursor-color*
When Vim enters Insert mode the 't_SI' escape sequence is sent.  When leaving
Insert mode 't_EI' is used.  But only if both are defined.  This can be used
to change the shape or color of the cursor in Insert mode.  These are not
standard termcap/terminfo entries, you need to set them yourself.
Example for an xterm, this changes the color of the cursor: >
    if &term =~ "xterm"
	let &t_SI = "\<Esc>]12;purple\x7"
	let &t_EI = "\<Esc>]12;blue\x7"
    endif
NOTE: When Vim exits the shape for Normal mode will remain.  The shape from
before Vim started will not be restored.
{not available when compiled without the |+cursorshape| feature}

							*termcap-title*
The 't_ts' and 't_fs' options are used to set the window title if the terminal
allows title setting via sending strings.  They are sent before and after the
title string, respectively.  Similar 't_IS' and 't_IE'  are used to set the
icon text.  These are Vim-internal extensions of the Unix termcap, so they
cannot be obtained from an external termcap.  However, the builtin termcap
contains suitable entries for xterm and iris-ansi, so you don't need to set
them here.
							*hpterm*
If inversion or other highlighting does not work correctly, try setting the
't_xs' option to a non-empty string.  This makes the 't_ce' code be used to
remove highlighting from a line.  This is required for "hpterm".  Setting the
'weirdinvert' option has the same effect as making 't_xs' non-empty, and vice
versa.

							*scroll-region*
Some termcaps do not include an entry for 'cs' (scroll region), although the
terminal does support it.  For example: xterm on a Sun.  You can use the
builtin_xterm or define t_cs yourself.  For example: >
	:set t_cs=^V^[[%i%d;%dr
Where ^V is CTRL-V and ^[ is <Esc>.

The vertical scroll region t_CV is not a standard termcap code.  Vim uses it
internally in the GUI.  But it can also be defined for a terminal, if you can
find one that supports it.  The two arguments are the left and right column of
the region which to restrict the scrolling to.  Just like t_cs defines the top
and bottom lines.  Defining t_CV will make scrolling in vertically split
windows a lot faster.  Don't set t_CV when t_da or t_db is set (text isn't
cleared when scrolling).

Unfortunately it is not possible to deduce from the termcap how cursor
positioning should be done when using a scrolling region: Relative to the
beginning of the screen or relative to the beginning of the scrolling region.
Most terminals use the first method.  A known exception is the MS-DOS console
(pcterm).  The 't_CS' option should be set to any string when cursor
positioning is relative to the start of the scrolling region.  It should be
set to an empty string otherwise.  It defaults to "yes" when 'term' is
"pcterm".

Note for xterm users: The shifted cursor keys normally don't work.  You can
	make them work with the xmodmap command and some mappings in Vim.

	Give these commands in the xterm:
		xmodmap -e "keysym Up = Up F13"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Down = Down F16"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Left = Left F18"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Right = Right F19"

	And use these mappings in Vim:
		:map <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map! <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map! <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map! <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map <t_F9> <S-Right>
		:map! <t_F9> <S-Right>

Instead of, say, <S-Up> you can use any other command that you want to use the
shift-cursor-up key for.  (Note: To help people that have a Sun keyboard with
left side keys F14 is not used because it is confused with the undo key; F15
is not used, because it does a window-to-front; F17 is not used, because it
closes the window.  On other systems you can probably use them.)

==============================================================================
3. Window size						*window-size*

[This is about the size of the whole window Vim is using, not a window that is
created with the ":split" command.]

If you are running Vim on an Amiga and the terminal name is "amiga" or
"builtin_amiga", the amiga-specific window resizing will be enabled.  On Unix
systems three methods are tried to get the window size:

- an ioctl call (TIOCGSIZE or TIOCGWINSZ, depends on your system)
- the environment variables "LINES" and "COLUMNS"
- from the termcap entries "li" and "co"

If everything fails a default size of 24 lines and 80 columns is assumed.  If
a window-resize signal is received the size will be set again.  If the window
size is wrong you can use the 'lines' and 'columns' options to set the
correct values.

One command can be used to set the screen size:

						*:mod* *:mode* *E359* *E362*
:mod[e] [mode]

Without argument this only detects the screen size and redraws the screen.
With MS-DOS it is possible to switch screen mode.  [mode] can be one of these
values:
	"bw40"		40 columns black&white
	"c40"		40 columns color
	"bw80"		80 columns black&white
	"c80"		80 columns color (most people use this)
	"mono"		80 columns monochrome
	"c4350"		43 or 50 lines EGA/VGA mode
	number		mode number to use, depends on your video card

==============================================================================
4. Slow and fast terminals			*slow-fast-terminal*
						*slow-terminal*

If you have a fast terminal you may like to set the 'ruler' option.  The
cursor position is shown in the status line.  If you are using horizontal
scrolling ('wrap' option off) consider setting 'sidescroll' to a small
number.

If you have a slow terminal you may want to reset the 'showcmd' option.
The command characters will not be shown in the status line.  If the terminal
scrolls very slowly, set the 'scrolljump' to 5 or so.  If the cursor is moved
off the screen (e.g., with "j") Vim will scroll 5 lines at a time.  Another
possibility is to reduce the number of lines that Vim uses with the command
"z{height}<CR>".

If the characters from the terminal are arriving with more than 1 second
between them you might want to set the 'timeout' and/or 'ttimeout' option.
See the "Options" chapter |options|.

If your terminal does not support a scrolling region, but it does support
insert/delete line commands, scrolling with multiple windows may make the
lines jump up and down.  If you don't want this set the 'ttyfast' option.
This will redraw the window instead of scroll it.

If your terminal scrolls very slowly, but redrawing is not slow, set the
'ttyscroll' option to a small number, e.g., 3.  This will make Vim redraw the
screen instead of scrolling, when there are more than 3 lines to be scrolled.

If you are using a color terminal that is slow, use this command: >
	hi NonText cterm=NONE ctermfg=NONE
This avoids that spaces are sent when they have different attributes.  On most
terminals you can't see this anyway.

If you are using Vim over a slow serial line, you might want to try running
Vim inside the "screen" program.  Screen will optimize the terminal I/O quite
a bit.

If you are testing termcap options, but you cannot see what is happening,
you might want to set the 'writedelay' option.  When non-zero, one character
is sent to the terminal at a time (does not work for MS-DOS).  This makes the
screen updating a lot slower, making it possible to see what is happening.

==============================================================================
5. Using the mouse					*mouse-using*

This section is about using the mouse on a terminal or a terminal window.  How
to use the mouse in a GUI window is explained in |gui-mouse|.  For scrolling
with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.

Don't forget to enable the mouse with this command: >
	:set mouse=a
Otherwise Vim won't recognize the mouse in all modes (See 'mouse').

Currently the mouse is supported for Unix in an xterm window, in a *BSD
console with |sysmouse|, in a Linux console (with GPM |gpm-mouse|), for
MS-DOS and in a Windows console.
Mouse clicks can be used to position the cursor, select an area and paste.

These characters in the 'mouse' option tell in which situations the mouse will
be used by Vim:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when in a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| prompt

The default for 'mouse' is empty, the mouse is not used.  Normally you would
do: >
	:set mouse=a
to start using the mouse (this is equivalent to setting 'mouse' to "nvich").
If you only want to use the mouse in a few modes or also want to use it for
the two questions you will have to concatenate the letters for those modes.
For example: >
	:set mouse=nv
Will make the mouse work in Normal mode and Visual mode. >
	:set mouse=h
Will make the mouse work in help files only (so you can use "g<LeftMouse>" to
jump to tags).

Whether the selection that is started with the mouse is in Visual mode or
Select mode depends on whether "mouse" is included in the 'selectmode'
option.

In an xterm, with the currently active mode included in the 'mouse' option,
normal mouse clicks are used by Vim, mouse clicks with the shift or ctrl key
pressed go to the xterm.  With the currently active mode not included in
'mouse' all mouse clicks go to the xterm.

							*xterm-clipboard*
In the Athena and Motif GUI versions, when running in a terminal and there is
access to the X-server (DISPLAY is set), the copy and paste will behave like
in the GUI.  If not, the middle mouse button will insert the unnamed register.
In that case, here is how you copy and paste a piece of text:

Copy/paste with the mouse and Visual mode ('mouse' option must be set, see
above):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.  This will start Visual mode and
   highlight the selected area.
2. Press "y" to yank the Visual text in the unnamed register.
3. Click the left mouse button at the insert position.
4. Click the middle mouse button.

Shortcut: If the insert position is on the screen at the same time as the
Visual text, you can do 2, 3 and 4 all in one: Click the middle mouse button
at the insert position.

Note: When the |-X| command line argument is used, Vim will not connect to the
X server and copy/paste to the X clipboard (selection) will not work.  Use the
shift key with the mouse buttons to let the xterm do the selection.

							*xterm-command-server*
When the X-server clipboard is available, the command server described in
|x11-clientserver| can be enabled with the --servername command line argument.

							*xterm-copy-paste*
NOTE: In some (older) xterms, it's not possible to move the cursor past column
95 or 223.  This is an xterm problem, not Vim's.  Get a newer xterm
|color-xterm|.  Also see |'ttymouse'|.

Copy/paste in xterm with (current mode NOT included in 'mouse'):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.
2. Use normal Vim commands to put the cursor at the insert position.
3. Press "a" to start Insert mode.
4. Click the middle mouse button.
5. Press ESC to end Insert mode.
(The same can be done with anything in 'mouse' if you keep the shift key
pressed while using the mouse.)

Note: if you lose the 8th bit when pasting (special characters are translated
into other characters), you may have to do "stty cs8 -istrip -parenb" in your
shell before starting Vim.

Thus in an xterm the shift and ctrl keys cannot be used with the mouse.  Mouse
commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing the "g" key
before using the mouse:
	"g<LeftMouse>"	is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
	"g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")

					*mouse-mode-table* *mouse-overview*
A short overview of what the mouse buttons do, when 'mousemodel' is "extend":

Normal Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<LeftMouse>     yes	     end	    yes
<C-LeftMouse>   yes	     end	    yes	   "CTRL-]" (2)
<S-LeftMouse>   yes	  no change	    yes	   "*" (2)    *<S-LeftMouse>*
<LeftDrag>      yes	start or extend (1) no		      *<LeftDrag>*
<LeftRelease>   yes	start or extend (1) no
<MiddleMouse>   yes	  if not active     no	   put
<MiddleMouse>   yes	  if active	    no	   yank and put
<RightMouse>    yes	start or extend     yes
<A-RightMouse>  yes start or extend blockw. yes		      *<A-RightMouse>*
<S-RightMouse>  yes	   no change	    yes	   "#" (2)    *<S-RightMouse>*
<C-RightMouse>  no	   no change	    no	   "CTRL-T"
<RightDrag>     yes	    extend	    no		      *<RightDrag>*
<RightRelease>  yes	    extend	    no		      *<RightRelease>*

Insert or Replace Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<LeftMouse>     yes     (cannot be active)  yes
<C-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O^]" (2)
<S-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O*" (2)
<LeftDrag>      yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<LeftRelease>   yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<MiddleMouse>   no      (cannot be active)  no	   put register
<RightMouse>    yes     start or extend	    yes	   like CTRL-O
<A-RightMouse>  yes start or extend blockw. yes
<S-RightMouse>  yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O#" (2)
<C-RightMouse>  no	(cannot be active)  no	   "CTRL-O CTRL-T"

In a help window:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<2-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  no	   "^]" (jump to help tag)

When 'mousemodel' is "popup", these are different:

Normal Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<S-LeftMouse>	yes	start or extend (1) no
<A-LeftMouse>   yes start or extend blockw. no		      *<A-LeftMouse>*
<RightMouse>	no	popup menu	    no

Insert or Replace Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<S-LeftMouse>   yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<A-LeftMouse>   yes start or extend blockw. no
<RightMouse>    no	popup menu	    no

(1) only if mouse pointer moved since press
(2) only if click is in same buffer

Clicking the left mouse button causes the cursor to be positioned.  If the
click is in another window that window is made the active window.  When
editing the command-line the cursor can only be positioned on the
command-line.  When in Insert mode Vim remains in Insert mode.  If 'scrolloff'
is set, and the cursor is positioned within 'scrolloff' lines from the window
border, the text is scrolled.

A selection can be started by pressing the left mouse button on the first
character, moving the mouse to the last character, then releasing the mouse
button.  You will not always see the selection until you release the button,
only in some versions (GUI, MS-DOS, WIN32) will the dragging be shown
immediately.  Note that you can make the text scroll by moving the mouse at
least one character in the first/last line in the window when 'scrolloff' is
non-zero.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button causes the
Visual area to be extended.  When 'mousemodel' is "popup", the left button has
to be used while keeping the shift key pressed.  When clicking in a window
which is editing another buffer, the Visual or Select mode is stopped.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button with the alt
key pressed causes the Visual area to become blockwise.  When 'mousemodel' is
"popup" the left button has to be used with the alt key.  Note that this won't
work on systems where the window manager consumes the mouse events when the
alt key is pressed (it may move the window).

							*double-click*
Double, triple and quadruple clicks are supported when the GUI is active,
for MS-DOS and Win32, and for an xterm (if the gettimeofday() function is
available).  For selecting text, extra clicks extend the selection:
	click		select ~
	double		word or % match		*<2-LeftMouse>*
	triple		line			*<3-LeftMouse>*
	quadruple	rectangular block	*<4-LeftMouse>*
Exception: In a Help window a double click jumps to help for the word that is
clicked on.
A double click on a word selects that word.  'iskeyword' is used to specify
which characters are included in a word.  A double click on a character
that has a match selects until that match (like using "v%").  If the match is
an #if/#else/#endif block, the selection becomes linewise.
For MS-DOS and xterm the time for double clicking can be set with the
'mousetime' option.  For the other systems this time is defined outside of
Vim.
An example, for using a double click to jump to the tag under the cursor: >
	:map <2-LeftMouse> :exe "tag ". expand("<cword>")<CR>

Dragging the mouse with a double click (button-down, button-up, button-down
and then drag) will result in whole words to be selected.  This continues
until the button is released, at which point the selection is per character
again.

							*gpm-mouse*
The GPM mouse is only supported when the |+mouse_gpm| feature was enabled at
compile time.  The GPM mouse driver (Linux console) does not support quadruple
clicks.

In Insert mode, when a selection is started, Vim goes into Normal mode
temporarily.  When Visual or Select mode ends, it returns to Insert mode.
This is like using CTRL-O in Insert mode.  Select mode is used when the
'selectmode' option contains "mouse".
							*sysmouse*
The sysmouse is only supported when the |+mouse_sysmouse| feature was enabled
at compile time.  The sysmouse driver (*BSD console) does not support keyboard
modifiers.

							*drag-status-line*
When working with several windows, the size of the windows can be changed by
dragging the status line with the mouse.  Point the mouse at a status line,
press the left button, move the mouse to the new position of the status line,
release the button.  Just clicking the mouse in a status line makes that window
the current window, without moving the cursor.  If by selecting a window it
will change position or size, the dragging of the status line will look
confusing, but it will work (just try it).

					*<MiddleRelease>* *<MiddleDrag>*
Mouse clicks can be mapped.  The codes for mouse clicks are:
     code	    mouse button	      normal action	~
 <LeftMouse>	 left pressed		    set cursor position
 <LeftDrag>	 left moved while pressed   extend selection
 <LeftRelease>	 left released		    set selection end
 <MiddleMouse>	 middle pressed		    paste text at cursor position
 <MiddleDrag>	 middle moved while pressed -
 <MiddleRelease> middle released	    -
 <RightMouse>	 right pressed		    extend selection
 <RightDrag>	 right moved while pressed  extend selection
 <RightRelease>  right released		    set selection end
 <X1Mouse>	 X1 button pressed	    -			*X1Mouse*
 <X1Drag>	 X1 moved while pressed	    -			*X1Drag*
 <X1Release>	 X1 button release	    -			*X1Release*
 <X2Mouse>	 X2 button pressed	    -			*X2Mouse*
 <X2Drag>	 X2 moved while pressed     -			*X2Drag*
 <X2Release>	 X2 button release	    -			*X2Release*

The X1 and X2 buttons refer to the extra buttons found on some mice.  The
'Microsoft Explorer' mouse has these buttons available to the right thumb.
Currently X1 and X2 only work on Win32 environments.

Examples: >
	:noremap <MiddleMouse> <LeftMouse><MiddleMouse>
Paste at the position of the middle mouse button click (otherwise the paste
would be done at the cursor position). >

	:noremap <LeftRelease> <LeftRelease>y
Immediately yank the selection, when using Visual mode.

Note the use of ":noremap" instead of "map" to avoid a recursive mapping.
>
	:map <X1Mouse> <C-O>
	:map <X2Mouse> <C-I>
Map the X1 and X2 buttons to go forwards and backwards in the jump list, see
|CTRL-O| and |CTRL-I|.

						*mouse-swap-buttons*
To swap the meaning of the left and right mouse buttons: >
	:noremap	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>
	:noremap	g<LeftMouse>	<C-RightMouse>
	:noremap	g<RightMouse>	<C-LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap!	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap!	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap!	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>

Editing C programs					*C-editing*

There are quite a few features in Vim to help you edit C program files.  Here
is an overview with tags to jump to:

|usr_29.txt|		Moving through programs chapter in the user manual.
|usr_30.txt|		Editing programs chapter in the user manual.
|C-indenting|		Automatically set the indent of a line while typing
			text.
|=|			Re-indent a few lines.
|format-comments|	Format comments.

|:checkpath|		Show all recursively included files.
|[i|			Search for identifier under cursor in current and
			included files.
|[_CTRL-I|		Jump to match for "[i"
|[I|			List all lines in current and included files where
			identifier under the cursor matches.
|[d|			Search for define under cursor in current and included
			files.

|CTRL-]|		Jump to tag under cursor (e.g., definition of a
			function).
|CTRL-T|		Jump back to before a CTRL-] command.
|:tselect|		Select one tag out of a list of matching tags.

|gd|			Go to Declaration of local variable under cursor.
|gD|			Go to Declaration of global variable under cursor.

|gf|			Go to file name under the cursor.

|[/|			Go to previous start of comment.
|]/|			Go to next end of comment.
|[#|			Go back to unclosed #if, #ifdef, or #else.
|]#|			Go forward to unclosed #else or #endif.
|[(|			Go back to unclosed '('
|])|			Go forward to unclosed ')'
|[{|			Go back to unclosed '{'
|]}|			Go forward to unclosed '}'

|v_ab|			Select "a block" from "[(" to "])", including braces
|v_ib|			Select "inner block" from "[(" to "])"
|v_aB|			Select "a block" from "[{" to "]}", including brackets
|v_iB|			Select "inner block" from "[{" to "]}"

==============================================================================
Finding where identifiers are used			*ident-search*

You probably already know that |tags| can be used to jump to the place where a
function or variable is defined.  But sometimes you wish you could jump to all
the places where a function or variable is being used.  This is possible in
two ways:
1. Using the |:grep| command.  This should work on most Unix systems,
   but can be slow (it reads all files) and only searches in one directory.
2. Using ID utils.  This is fast and works in multiple directories.  It uses a
   database to store locations.  You will need some additional programs for
   this to work.  And you need to keep the database up to date.

Using the GNU id-tools:

What you need:
- The GNU id-tools installed (mkid is needed to create ID and lid is needed to
  use the macros).
- An identifier database file called "ID" in the current directory.  You can
  create it with the shell command "mkid file1 file2 ..".

Put this in your .vimrc: >
	map _u :call ID_search()<Bar>execute "/\\<" . g:word . "\\>"<CR>
	map _n :n<Bar>execute "/\\<" . g:word . "\\>"<CR>

	function! ID_search()
	  let g:word = expand("<cword>")
	  let x = system("lid --key=none ". g:word)
	  let x = substitute(x, "\n", " ", "g")
	  execute "next " . x
	endfun

To use it, place the cursor on a word, type "_u" and vim will load the file
that contains the word.  Search for the next occurrence of the word in the
same file with "n".  Go to the next file with "_n".

This has been tested with id-utils-3.2 (which is the name of the id-tools
archive file on your closest gnu-ftp-mirror).

[the idea for this comes from Andreas Kutschera]

==============================================================================
Switching screens in an xterm		*xterm-screens* *xterm-save-screen*

(From comp.editors, by Juergen Weigert, in reply to a question)

:> Another question is that after exiting vim, the screen is left as it
:> was, i.e. the contents of the file I was viewing (editing) was left on
:> the screen. The output from my previous like "ls" were lost,
:> ie. no longer in the scrolling buffer. I know that there is a way to
:> restore the screen after exiting vim or other vi like editors,
:> I just don't know how. Helps are appreciated. Thanks.
:
:I imagine someone else can answer this.  I assume though that vim and vi do
:the same thing as each other for a given xterm setup.

They not necessarily do the same thing, as this may be a termcap vs.
terminfo problem.  You should be aware that there are two databases for
describing attributes of a particular type of terminal: termcap and
terminfo.  This can cause differences when the entries differ AND when of
the programs in question one uses terminfo and the other uses termcap
(also see |+terminfo|).

In your particular problem, you are looking for the control sequences
^[[?47h and ^[[?47l.  These switch between xterms alternate and main screen
buffer.  As a quick workaround a command sequence like >
	echo -n "^[[?47h"; vim ... ; echo -n "^[[?47l"
may do what you want.  (My notation ^[ means the ESC character, further down
you'll see that the databases use \E instead).

On startup, vim echoes the value of the termcap variable ti (terminfo:
smcup) to the terminal.  When exiting, it echoes te (terminfo: rmcup).  Thus
these two variables are the correct place where the above mentioned control
sequences should go.

Compare your xterm termcap entry (found in /etc/termcap) with your xterm
terminfo entry (retrieved with "infocmp -C xterm").  Both should contain
entries similar to: >
	:te=\E[2J\E[?47l\E8:ti=\E7\E[?47h:

PS: If you find any difference, someone (your sysadmin?) should better check
    the complete termcap and terminfo database for consistency.

NOTE 1: If you recompile Vim with FEAT_XTERM_SAVE defined in feature.h, the
builtin xterm will include the mentioned "te" and "ti" entries.

NOTE 2: If you want to disable the screen switching, and you don't want to
change your termcap, you can add these lines to your .vimrc: >
	:set t_ti= t_te=

==============================================================================
Scrolling in Insert mode				*scroll-insert*

If you are in insert mode and you want to see something that is just off the
screen, you can use CTRL-X CTRL-E and CTRL-X CTRL-Y to scroll the screen.
						|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-E|

To make this easier, you could use these mappings: >
	:inoremap <C-E> <C-X><C-E>
	:inoremap <C-Y> <C-X><C-Y>
(Type this literally, make sure the '<' flag is not in 'cpoptions').
You then lose the ability to copy text from the line above/below the cursor
|i_CTRL-E|.

Also consider setting 'scrolloff' to a larger value, so that you can always see
some context around the cursor.  If 'scrolloff' is bigger than half the window
height, the cursor will always be in the middle and the text is scrolled when
the cursor is moved up/down.

==============================================================================
Smooth scrolling					*scroll-smooth*

If you like the scrolling to go a bit smoother, you can use these mappings: >
	:map <C-U> <C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y><C-Y>
	:map <C-D> <C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E><C-E>

(Type this literally, make sure the '<' flag is not in 'cpoptions').

==============================================================================
Correcting common typing mistakes			*type-mistakes*

When there are a few words that you keep on typing in the wrong way, make
abbreviations that correct them.  For example: >
	:ab teh the
	:ab fro for

==============================================================================
Counting words, lines, etc.				*count-items*

To count how often any pattern occurs in the current buffer use the substitute
command and add the 'n' flag to avoid the substitution.  The reported number
of substitutions is the number of items.  Examples: >

	:%s/./&/gn		characters
	:%s/\i\+/&/gn		words
	:%s/^//n		lines
	:%s/the/&/gn		"the" anywhere
	:%s/\<the\>/&/gn	"the" as a word

You might want to reset 'hlsearch' or do ":nohlsearch".
Add the 'e' flag if you don't want an error when there are no matches.

An alternative is using |v_g_CTRL-G| in Visual mode.

If you want to find matches in multiple files use |:vimgrep|.

							*count-bytes*
If you want to count bytes, you can use this:

	Visually select the characters (block is also possible)
	Use "y" to yank the characters
	Use the strlen() function: >
		:echo strlen(@")
A line break is counted for one byte.

==============================================================================
Restoring the cursor position				*restore-position*

Sometimes you want to write a mapping that makes a change somewhere in the
file and restores the cursor position, without scrolling the text.  For
example, to change the date mark in a file: >
   :map <F2> msHmtgg/Last [cC]hange:\s*/e+1<CR>"_D"=strftime("%Y %b %d")<CR>p'tzt`s

Breaking up saving the position:
	ms	store cursor position in the 's' mark
	H	go to the first line in the window
	mt	store this position in the 't' mark

Breaking up restoring the position:
	't	go to the line previously at the top of the window
	zt	scroll to move this line to the top of the window
	`s	jump to the original position of the cursor

For something more advanced see |winsaveview()| and |winrestview()|.

==============================================================================
Renaming files						*rename-files*

Say I have a directory with the following files in them (directory picked at
random :-):

buffer.c
charset.c
digraph.c
...

and I want to rename *.c *.bla.  I'd do it like this: >

	$ vim
	:r !ls *.c
	:%s/\(.*\).c/mv & \1.bla
	:w !sh
	:q!

==============================================================================
Change a name in multiple files				*change-name*

Example for using a script file to change a name in several files:

	Create a file "subs.vim" containing substitute commands and a :update
	command: >
		:%s/Jones/Smith/g
		:%s/Allen/Peter/g
		:update
<
	Execute Vim on all files you want to change, and source the script for
	each argument: >

		vim *.let
		argdo source subs.vim

See |:argdo|.

==============================================================================
Speeding up external commands				*speed-up*

In some situations, execution of an external command can be very slow.  This
can also slow down wildcard expansion on Unix.  Here are a few suggestions to
increase the speed.

If your .cshrc (or other file, depending on the shell used) is very long, you
should separate it into a section for interactive use and a section for
non-interactive use (often called secondary shells).  When you execute a
command from Vim like ":!ls", you do not need the interactive things (for
example, setting the prompt).  Put the stuff that is not needed after these
lines: >

	if ($?prompt == 0) then
		exit 0
	endif

Another way is to include the "-f" flag in the 'shell' option, e.g.: >

	:set shell=csh\ -f

(the backslash is needed to include the space in the option).
This will make csh completely skip the use of the .cshrc file.  This may cause
some things to stop working though.

==============================================================================
Useful mappings						*useful-mappings*

Here are a few mappings that some people like to use.

							*map-backtick*  >
	:map ' `
Make the single quote work like a backtick.  Puts the cursor on the column of
a mark, instead of going to the first non-blank character in the line.

							*emacs-keys*
For Emacs-style editing on the command-line: >
	" start of line
	:cnoremap <C-A>		<Home>
	" back one character
	:cnoremap <C-B>		<Left>
	" delete character under cursor
	:cnoremap <C-D>		<Del>
	" end of line
	:cnoremap <C-E>		<End>
	" forward one character
	:cnoremap <C-F>		<Right>
	" recall newer command-line
	:cnoremap <C-N>		<Down>
	" recall previous (older) command-line
	:cnoremap <C-P>		<Up>
	" back one word
	:cnoremap <Esc><C-B>	<S-Left>
	" forward one word
	:cnoremap <Esc><C-F>	<S-Right>

NOTE: This requires that the '<' flag is excluded from 'cpoptions'. |<>|

							*format-bullet-list*
This mapping will format any bullet list.  It requires that there is an empty
line above and below each list entry.  The expression commands are used to
be able to give comments to the parts of the mapping. >

	:let m =     ":map _f  :set ai<CR>"    " need 'autoindent' set
	:let m = m . "{O<Esc>"		      " add empty line above item
	:let m = m . "}{)^W"		      " move to text after bullet
	:let m = m . "i     <CR>     <Esc>"    " add space for indent
	:let m = m . "gq}"		      " format text after the bullet
	:let m = m . "{dd"		      " remove the empty line
	:let m = m . "5lDJ"		      " put text after bullet
	:execute m			      |" define the mapping

(<> notation |<>|.  Note that this is all typed literally.  ^W is "^" "W", not
CTRL-W.  You can copy/paste this into Vim if '<' is not included in
'cpoptions'.)

Note that the last comment starts with |", because the ":execute" command
doesn't accept a comment directly.

You also need to set 'textwidth' to a non-zero value, e.g., >
	:set tw=70

A mapping that does about the same, but takes the indent for the list from the
first line (Note: this mapping is a single long line with a lot of spaces): >
	:map _f :set ai<CR>}{a                                                          <Esc>WWmmkD`mi<CR><Esc>kkddpJgq}'mJO<Esc>j
<
							*collapse*
These two mappings reduce a sequence of empty (;b) or blank (;n) lines into a
single line >
    :map ;b   GoZ<Esc>:g/^$/.,/./-j<CR>Gdd
    :map ;n   GoZ<Esc>:g/^[ <Tab>]*$/.,/[^ <Tab>]/-j<CR>Gdd

==============================================================================
Compressing the help files				*gzip-helpfile*

For those of you who are really short on disk space, you can compress the help
files and still be able to view them with Vim.  This makes accessing the help
files a bit slower and requires the "gzip" program.

(1) Compress all the help files: "gzip doc/*.txt".

(2) Edit "doc/tags" and change the ".txt" to ".txt.gz": >
	:%s=\(\t.*\.txt\)\t=\1.gz\t=

(3) Add this line to your vimrc: >
	set helpfile={dirname}/help.txt.gz

Where {dirname} is the directory where the help files are.  The |gzip| plugin
will take care of decompressing the files.
You must make sure that $VIMRUNTIME is set to where the other Vim files are,
when they are not in the same location as the compressed "doc" directory.  See
|$VIMRUNTIME|.

==============================================================================
Executing shell commands in a window			*shell-window*

There have been questions for the possibility to execute a shell in a window
inside Vim.  The answer: you can't!  Including this would add a lot of code to
Vim, which is a good reason not to do this.  After all, Vim is an editor, it
is not supposed to do non-editing tasks.  However, to get something like this,
you might try splitting your terminal screen or display window with the
"splitvt" program.  You can probably find it on some ftp server.  The person
that knows more about this is Sam Lantinga <slouken@cs.ucdavis.edu>.
An alternative is the "window" command, found on BSD Unix systems, which
supports multiple overlapped windows.  Or the "screen" program, found at
www.uni-erlangen.de, which supports a stack of windows.

==============================================================================
Hex editing					*hex-editing* *using-xxd*

See section |23.4| of the user manual.

If one has a particular extension that one uses for binary files (such as exe,
bin, etc), you may find it helpful to automate the process with the following
bit of autocmds for your <.vimrc>.  Change that "*.bin" to whatever
comma-separated list of extension(s) you find yourself wanting to edit: >

	" vim -b : edit binary using xxd-format!
	augroup Binary
	  au!
	  au BufReadPre  *.bin let &bin=1
	  au BufReadPost *.bin if &bin | %!xxd
	  au BufReadPost *.bin set ft=xxd | endif
	  au BufWritePre *.bin if &bin | %!xxd -r
	  au BufWritePre *.bin endif
	  au BufWritePost *.bin if &bin | %!xxd
	  au BufWritePost *.bin set nomod | endif
	augroup END

==============================================================================
Using <> notation in autocommands			*autocmd-<>*

The <> notation is not recognized in the argument of an :autocmd.  To avoid
having to use special characters, you could use a self-destroying mapping to
get the <> notation and then call the mapping from the autocmd.  Example:

						*map-self-destroy*  >
 " This is for automatically adding the name of the file to the menu list.
 " It uses a self-destroying mapping!
 " 1. use a line in the buffer to convert the 'dots' in the file name to \.
 " 2. store that in register '"'
 " 3. add that name to the Buffers menu list
 " WARNING: this does have some side effects, like overwriting the
 " current register contents and removing any mapping for the "i" command.
 "
 autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPre * nmap i :nunmap i<CR>O<C-R>%<Esc>:.g/\./s/\./\\./g<CR>0"9y$u:menu Buffers.<C-R>9 :buffer <C-R>%<C-V><CR><CR>
 autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPre * normal i

Another method, perhaps better, is to use the ":execute" command.  In the
string you can use the <> notation by preceding it with a backslash.  Don't
forget to double the number of existing backslashes and put a backslash before
'"'.
>
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPre * exe "normal O\<C-R>%\<Esc>:.g/\\./s/\\./\\\\./g\<CR>0\"9y$u:menu Buffers.\<C-R>9 :buffer \<C-R>%\<C-V>\<CR>\<CR>"

For a real buffer menu, user functions should be used (see |:function|), but
then the <> notation isn't used, which defeats using it as an example here.

==============================================================================
Highlighting matching parens					*match-parens*

This example shows the use of a few advanced tricks:
- using the |CursorMoved| autocommand event
- using |searchpairpos()| to find a matching paren
- using |synID()| to detect whether the cursor is in a string or comment
- using |:match| to highlight something
- using a |pattern| to match a specific position in the file.

This should be put in a Vim script file, since it uses script-local variables.
It skips matches in strings or comments, unless the cursor started in string
or comment.  This requires syntax highlighting.

A slightly more advanced version is used in the |matchparen| plugin.

Problem with upwards search on Windows (works OK on Linux). (Brett Stahlman,
2014 Jun 8)

Patch to load TCL dynamically. (Ken Takata, 2014 Sep 20)

Include a plugin manager with Vim? Neobundle seems to be the best currently.
Long message about this from ZyX, 2014 Mar 23.  And following replies.
Also see http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/topic/vim%20plugin%20managment.html
User view:
- Support multiple sources, basically any http:// URL.  Be able to look into
  the files before deciding to install.
- Be able to try out a plugin and remove it again with (almost) no traces.
- Each plugin needs a "manifest" file that has the version, dependencies
  (including Vim version and features), conflicts, list of files, etc.
  Updater uses that to decide what/how to update.
  Dependencies can use a URL for specific versions, or short name for scripts
  on vim.org.
- Once a plugin is installed it remembers where it came from, updater checks
  there.  Can manually update when really needed.
- Must be possible to install for one user.  Also system wide?
- Can edit plugin config with Vim. Can temporarily disable a plugin.
- Run the update manually, find latest version and install.
- Be able to download without special tools, must work for 95% of users.
Implementation:
- Avoid the 'runtimepath' getting long.  Need some other way to keep each
  plugin separate.
- When installing or updating, first figure out what needs to be done. This
  may involve recursively fetching manifest files for dependencies.  Then show
  the user what's going to change and ask for OK.
- Scripts on Vim.org must be able to consist of several files.  Is zip format
  sufficient?  Upload the manifest?  Or refer to a site that has the manifest?
- Best is to fetch individual files or use a Vimball. Reduces dependency on
  tools that might be missing and allows inspection of the files before
  installing.
Out of scope:
- Overview of plugins, ratings, comments, etc.  That's another world.
- Development work on plugins (although diff with distributed version would be
  useful).

(Evan Laforge, 2009 Oct 17)

Bug: When reloading a buffer changed outside of Vim, BufRead autocommands
are applied to the wrong buffer/window. (Ben Fritz, 2009 Apr 2, May 11)
Ignore window options when not in the right window?
Perhaps we need to use a hidden window for applying autocommands to a buffer
that doesn't have a window.

When using "ab foo bar" and mapping <Tab> to <Esc>, pressing <Tab> after foo
doesn't trigger the abbreviation like <Esc> would. (Ramana Kumar, 2009 Sep 6)

getbufvar() to get a window-local option value for a buffer that's not
displayed in a window should return the value that's stored for that buffer.

":he ctrl_u" can be auto-corrected to ":he ctrl-u".

There should be a way after an abbreviation has expanded to go back to what
was typed.  CTRL-G h ?  Would also undo last word or line break inserted
perhaps.  And undo CTRL-W.  CTRL-G l would redo.

Diff mode out of sync. (Gary Johnson, 2010 Aug 4)

Support a 'systemencoding' option (for Unix).  It specifies the encoding of
file names. (Kikuchan, 2010 Oct 5).  Useful on a latin1 or double-byte Asian
system when 'encoding' is "utf-8".

Win32 GUI: last message from startup doesn't show up when there is an echoerr

Using ~ works OK on 'a' with composing char, but not on 0x0418  with composing
char 0x0301. (Tony Mechelynck, 2009 Mar 4)

Searching for composing char works, but not when inside []. (ZyX, Benjamin R.

This does not work yet: "a\(%C\)" (get composing characters into a submatch).

A function on a dictionary is not profiled. (ZyX, 2010 Dec 25)

Inconsistent: starting with $LANG set to es_ES.utf-8 gives Spanish

When $HOME contains special characters, such as a comma, escape them when used
in an option. (Michael Hordijk, 2009 May 5)
Turn "esc" argument of expand_env_esc() into string of chars to be escaped.

Consider making YankRing or something else that keeps a list of yanked text
part of standard Vim.  The "1 to "9 registers are not sufficient.

netrw: dragging status line causes selection of entry.  Should check row
number to be below last visible line.

After doing "su" $HOME can be the old user's home, thus ~root/file is not
correct.  Don't use it in the swap file.

Completion for ":buf" doesn't work properly on Win32 when 'shellslash' is off.
(Henrik Ohman, 2009, Jan 29)

shellescape() depends on 'shellslash' for quoting.  That doesn't work when
'shellslash' is set but using cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz)
Use a different option or let it depend on whether 'shell' looks like a
unix-like shell?

Bug: in Ex mode (after "Q") backslash before line break, when yanked into a

ATTENTION message?  (Tony Mechelynck, 2008 Dec 1)
Also: swap files are in ~/tmp/  One has relative file name ".mozilla/...".

Add v:motion_force. (Kana Natsuno, 2008 Dec 6)
Maybe call it v:motiontype.

MS-Windows: editing the first, empty buffer, 'ffs' set to "unix,dos", ":enew"
doesn't set 'ff' to "unix".  (Ben Fritz, 2008 Dec 5) Reusing the old buffer
probably causes this.

Having "Syntax" in 'eventignore' for :bufdo may cause problems, e.g. for
":bufdo e" when buffers are open in windows.  ex_listdo(eap) could set the
option only for when jumping to another buffer, not when the command argument
is executed.

":pedit %" with a BufReadPre autocommand causes the cursor to move to the

On Unix "glob('does not exist~')" returns the string.  Without the "~" it
doesn't. (John Little, 2008 Nov 9)
Shell expansion returns unexpanded string?
Don't use shell when "~" is not at the start?

":unlet $VAR" doesn't work.

When using ":e ++enc=foo file" and the file is already loaded with
'fileencoding' set to "bar", then do_ecmd() uses that buffer, even though the
fileencoding differs.  Reload the buffer in this situation?  Need to check for
the buffer to be unmodified.
Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 11.  Followup Jul 14, need to have
another look at it.

c.vim: XXX in a comment is colored yellow, but not when it's after "#if 0".
(Ilya Dogolazky, 2009 Aug 7)

You can type ":w ++bad=x fname", but the ++bad argument is ignored.  Give an
error message?  Or is this easy to implement?  (Nathan Stratton Treadway, 2008
Aug 20)  This is in ucs2bytes(), search for 0xBF.  Using the ++bad argument is
at the other match for 0xBF.

When adding "-complete=file" to a user command this also changes how the

Win32: associating a type with Vim doesn't take care of space after a

When mapping : to ; and ; to :, @; doesn't work like @: and @: doesn't work
either.  Matt Wozniski:  nv_at() calls do_execreg() which uses
put_in_typebuf().  Char mapped twice?

Despite adding save_subexpr() this still doesn't work properly:
Regexp: matchlist('12a4aaa', '^\(.\{-}\)\(\%5c\@<=a\+\)\(.\+\)\?')
Returns ['12a4', 'aaa', '4aaa'], should be ['12a4', 'aaa', '']

Command line completion: Scanning for tags doesn't check for typed key now and
then?  Hangs for about 5 seconds.  Appears to be caused by finding include
files with "foo/**" in 'path'.  (Kalisiak, 2006 July 15)
Additional info: When using the |wildcards| ** globing, vim hangs
indefinitely on lots of directories. The |file-searching| globing, like in
":set path=/**" does not hang as often as with globing with |wildcards|, like
in ":1find /**/file".  This is for files that unix "find" can find very
quickly. Merging the 2 kinds of globing might make this an easier fix. (Ian
Kelling, 2008 July 4)

When the file name has parenthesis, e.g., "foo (bar).txt", ":!ls '%'" has the
parenthesis escaped but not the space.  That's inconsistent.  Either escape
neither or both.  No escaping might be best, because it doesn't depend on
particularities of the shell. (Zvi Har'El, 2007 Nov 10) (Teemu Likonen, 2008

However, for backwards compatibility escaping might be necessary.  Check if

2008)  Use http://downloads.sourceforge.net/rospell/ro_RO.3.2.zip
Or the hunspell-ro.3.2.tar.gz file, it also has a iso-8859-2 list.

In a C file with spell checking, in "% integer" "nteger" is seen as an error,
but "]s" doesn't find it.  "nteger" by itself is found. (Ralf Wildenhues, 2008
Jul 22)

There should be something about spell checking in the user manual.

Spell menu: When using the Popup menu to select a replacement word,
":spellrepeat" doesn't work.  SpellReplace() uses setline().  Can it use "z="
somehow?  Or use a new function.

Mac: Using gvim: netrw window disappears. (Nick Lo, 2006 Jun 21)

Add an option to specify the character to use when a double-width character is
moved to the next line.  Default '>', set to a space to blank it out.  Check
that char is single width when it's set (compare with 'listchars').

The generated vim.bat can avoid the loop for NT. (Carl Zmola, 2006 Sep 3)

When showing a diff between a non-existent file and an existing one, with the
cursor in the empty buffer, the other buffer only shows the last line.  Change
the "insert" into a change from one line to many? (Yakov Lerner, 2008 May 27)

Add autocommand for when a tabpage is being closed.  Also for when a tab page
has been created.

Using ":make" blocks Vim.  Allow running one make in the background (if the
shell supports it), catch errors in a file and update the error list on the
fly.  A bit like "!make > file&" and repeating ":cf file".  ":bgmake",
background make.  ":bgcancel" interrupts it.
A.Politz may work on this.

These two abbreviations don't give the same result:
	let asdfasdf = "xyz\<Left>"
	cabbr XXX <C-R>=asdfasdf<CR>
	cabbr YYY xyz<Left>

Michael Dietrich: maximized gvim sometimes displays output of external command
partly. (2006 Dec 7)

In FileChangedShell command it's no longer allowed to switch to another
buffer.  But the changed buffer may differ from the current buffer, how to
reload it then?

New syntax files for fstab and resolv from Radu Dineiu, David Necas did
previous version.

For Aap: include a config.arg.example file with hints how to use config.arg.

Command line completion when 'cmdheight' is maximum and 'wildmenu' is set,
only one buffer line displayed, causes display errors.

Completing with 'wildmenu' and using <Up> and <Down> to move through directory
tree stops unexpectedly when using ":cd " and entering a directory that
doesn't contain other directories.

Default for 'background' is wrong when using xterm with 256 colors.
Table with estimates from Matteo Cavalleri, 2014 Jan 10.

Setting 'background' resets the Normal background color:
   highlight Normal ctermbg=DarkGray
   set background=dark
This is undesired, 'background' is supposed to tell Vim what the background
color is, not reset it.

Linux distributions:
- Suggest compiling xterm with --enable-tcap-query, so that nr of colors is
  known to Vim.  88 colors instead of 16 works better.  See ":help
  xfree-xterm".
- Suggest including bare "vi" and "vim" with X11, syntax, etc.

Completion menu: For a wrapping line, completing a long file name, only the
start of the path is shown in the menu.  Should move the menu to the right to
show more text of the completions.  Shorten the items that don't fit in the
middle?

When running inside screen it's possible to kill the X server and restart it
(using pty's the program can keep on running).  Vim dies because it loses the
connection to the X server.  Can Vim simply quit using the X server instead of
dying?  Also relevant when running in a console.

Accessing file#var in a function should not need the g: prepended.

When exiting detects a modified buffer, instead of opening the buffer in the
current tab, use an existing tab, if possible.  Like finding a window where
the buffer is displayed. (Antonios Tsakiridis)

When ":cn" moves to an error in the same line the message isn't shortened.
Only skip shortening for ":cc"?

Write "making vim work better" for the docs (mostly pointers): *nice*
    - sourcing $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
    - setting 'mouse' to "a"
    - getting colors in xterm
    - compiling Vim with X11, GUI, etc.

Problem with ":call" and dictionary function. Hari Krishna Dara, Charles
Campbell 2006 Jul 06.

Syntax HL error caused by "containedin". (Peter Hodge, 2006 Oct 6)

A custom completion function in a ":command" cannot be a Funcref. (Andy
Wokula, 2007 Aug 25)

Problem with using :redir in user command completion function? (Hari Krishna
Dara, 2006 June 21)

Another resizing problem when setting 'columns' and 'lines' to a very large
number. (Tony Mechelynck, 2007 Feb 6)

After starting Vim, using '0 to jump somewhere in a file, ":sp" doesn't center
the cursor line.  It works OK after some other commands.

Win32: Is it possible to have both postscript and Win32 printing?

Check: Running Vim in a console and still having connect to the X server for
copy/paste: is stopping the X server handled gracefully?  Should catch the X
error and stop using the connection to the server.

Problem with 'cdpath' on MS-Windows when a directory is equal to $HOME. (2006
Jul 26, Gary Johnson)

Using UTF-8 character with ":command" does not work properly. (Matt Wozniski,
2008 Sep 29)

In the Netbeans interface add a "vimeval" function, so that the other side can
check the result of has("patch13").

Cursor line at bottom of window instead of halfway after saving view and
restoring.  Only with 'nowrap'. (Robert Webb, 2008 Aug 25)

Netrw has trouble executing autocommands only for a directory.  Add <isdir>
and <notisdir> to autocommand patterns?  Also <isfile>?

Add command modifier that skips wildcard expansion, so that you don't need to
put backslashes before special chars, only for white space.

Syntax HL: open two windows on the same C code, delete a ")" in one window,
resulting in highlighted "{" in that window, not in the other.

In mswin.vim: Instead of mapping <C-V> for Insert mode in a complicated way,
can it be done like ":imap <C-V> <MiddleMouse>" without negative side effects?

GTK: when the Tab pages bar appears or disappears while the window is
maximized the window is no longer maximized.  Patch that has some idea but
doesn't work from Geoffrey Antos, 2008 May 5.
Also: the window may no longer fit on the screen, thus the command line is not
visible.

When right after "vim file", "M" then CTRL-W v the windows are scrolled
differently and unexpectedly.  Caused by patch 7.2.398?

The magic clipboard format "VimClipboard2" appears in several places.  Should
be only one.

"vim -C" often has 'nocompatible', because it's set somewhere in a startup
script.  Do "set compatible" after startup?

It's difficult to debug numbered functions (function in a Dictionary).  Print
the function name before resolving it to a number?
	let d = {}
	fun! d.foo()
	  echo "here"
	endfun
	call d.foo(9)

Add a mark for the other end of the Visual area (VIsual pos).  '< and '> are
only set after Visual moded is ended.
Also add a variable for the Visual mode.  So that this mode and '< '> can be
used to set what "gv" selects. (Ben Schmidt)

Win32: When running ":make" and 'encoding' differs from the system locale, the
output should be converted.  Esp. when 'encoding' is "utf-8". (Yongwei Wu)
Should we use 'termencoding' for this?

Win32, NTFS: When editing a specific infostream directly and 'backupcopy' is
"auto" should detect this situation and work like 'backupcopy' is "yes".  File
name is something like "c:\path\foo.txt:bar", includes a colon.  (Alex
Jakushev, 2008 Feb 1)

printf() uses the field width in bytes. Can it be made character width,
perhaps with a modifier?  What does Posix say?

Small problem displaying diff filler line when opening windows with a script.
(David Luyer, 2007 Mar 1 ~/Mail/oldmail/mool/in.15872 )

Is it allowed that 'backupext' is empty?  Problems when backup is in same dir
as original file?  If it's OK don't compare with 'patchmode'. (Thierry Closen)

Patch for supporting count before CR in quickfix window. (AOYAMA Shotaro, 2007
Jan 1)

Patch for adding ":lscscope". (Navdeep Parhar, 2007 Apr 26; update 2008 Apr
23)

":mkview" isn't called with the right buffer argument.  Happens when using
tabs and the autocommand "autocmd BufWinLeave * mkview".  (James Vega, 2007
Jun 18)

xterm should be able to pass focus changes to Vim, so that Vim can check for
buffers that changed.  Perhaps in misc.c, function selectwindow().
Xterm 224 supports it!

When completing from another file that uses a different encoding completion
text has the wrong encoding.  E.g., when 'encoding' is utf-8 and file is
latin1.  Example from Gombault Damien, 2007 Mar 24.

Is it possible to use "foo#var" instead of "g:foo#var" inside a function?

Syntax HL: When using "nextgroup" and the group has an empty match, there is
no search at that position for another match. (Lukas Mai, 2008 April 11)

In gvim the backspace key produces a backspace character, but on Linux the
VERASE key is Delete.  Set VERASE to Backspace? (patch by Stephane Chazelas,
2007 Oct 16)

TermResponse autocommand isn't always triggered when using vimdiff. (Aron
Griffis, 2007 Sep 19)

Create a gvimtutor.1 file and change Makefiles to install it.

When 'encoding' is utf-8 typing text at the end of the line causes previously
typed characters to be redrawn.  Caused by patch 7.1.329. (Tyler Spivey, 2008
Sep 3, 11)

When Vim in an xterm owns the selection and the user does ":shell" Vim doesn't
respond to selection requests.  Invoking XtDisownSelection() before executing
the shell doesn't help.  Would require forking and doing a message loop, like
what happens for the GUI.

X11: Putting more than about 262040 characters of text on the clipboard and
pasting it in another Vim doesn't work.  (Dominique Pelle, 2008 Aug 21-23)
clip_x11_request_selection_cb() is called with zero value and length.
Also: Get an error message from free() in the process that owns the selection.
Seems to happen when the selection is requested the second time, but before
clip_x11_convert_selection_cb() is invoked, thus in X library code.

":vimgrep" does not recognize a recursive symlink.  Is it possible to detect
this, at least for Unix (using device/inode)?

When switching between windows the cursor is often put in the middle.
Remember the relative position and restore that, just like lnum and col are
restored. (Luc St-Louis)

Patch to support horizontal scroll wheel in GTK. Untested. (Bjorn Winckler,
2010 Jun 30)

Add an option for a minimal text length before inserting a line break for
'textwidth'.  Avoids very short lines when a very long word follows.
(Kartik Agaram)


At next release:
-   Build a huge version by default.
-   Improve plugin handling: Automatic updates, handle dependencies?
    E.g. Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

Awaiting updated patches:
9   Mac unicode patch (Da Woon Jung, Eckehard Berns):
    8   Add patch from Muraoka Taro (Mar 16) to support input method on Mac?
	New patch 2004 Jun 16
    - selecting proportional font breaks display
    - UTF-8 text causes display problems.  Font replacement causes this.
    - Command-key mappings do not work. (Alan Schmitt)
    - With 'nopaste' pasting is wrong, with 'paste' Command-V doesn't work.
      (Alan Schmitt)
    - remove 'macatsui' option when this has been fixed.
    - when 'macatsui' is off should we always convert to "macroman" and ignore
      'termencoding'?
9   HTML indenting can be slow.  Caused by using searchpair().  Can search()
    be used instead?  A.Politz is looking into a solution.
8   Win32: Add minidump generation. (George Reilly, 2006 Apr 24)
8   Add ":n" to fnamemodify(): normalize path, remove "../" when possible.
    Aric Blumer has a patch for this.  He will update the patch for 6.3.
7   Completion of network shares, patch by Yasuhiro Matsumoto.
    Update 2004 Sep 6.
    How does this work?  Missing comments.
8   Add a few more command names to the menus.  Patch from Jiri Brezina
    (28 feb 2002).  Will mess the translations...
7   ATTENTION dialog choices are more logical when "Delete it" appears
    before "Quit".  Patch by Robert Webb, 2004 May 3.
-   Include flipcase patch: ~/vim/patches/wall.flipcase2 ?  Make it work
    for multi-byte characters.
-   Win32: add options to print dialog.  Patch from Vipin Aravind.
-   Patch to add highlighting for whitespace. (Tom Schumm, 2003 Jul 5)
    use the patch that keeps using HLF_8 if HLF_WS has not
    been given values.
    Add section in help files for these highlight groups?
8   "fg" and "bg" don't work in an xterm.  Get default colors from xterm
    with an ESC sequence.
    xterm can send colors for many things.  E.g. for the cursor:
	<Esc>]12;?<Bel>
    Can use this to get the background color and restore the colors on exit.
7   Add "DefaultFG" and "DefaultBG" for the colors of the menu. (Marcin
    Dalecki has a patch for Motif and Carbon)
-   Add possibility to highlight specific columns (for Fortran).  Or put a
    line in between columns (e.g., for 'textwidth').
    Patch to add 'hlcolumn' from Vit Stradal, 2004 May 20.
8   Add functions:
    gettext()		Translate a message.  (Patch from Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
			Update 2004 Sep 10
			Another patch from Edward L. Fox (2005 Nov 24)
			Search in 'runtimepath'?
			More docs needed about how to use this.
			How to get the messages into the .po files?
    strchars()		Like strlen() and strwidth() but counting characters
			instead of bytes.
    confirm()		add "flags" argument, with 'v' for vertical
			    layout and 'c' for console dialog. (Haegg)
			    Flemming Madsen has a patch for the 'c' flag
			    (2003 May 13)
    raisewin()		raise gvim window (see HierAssist patch for
			    Tcl implementation ~/vim/HierAssist/ )
    taglist()		add argument to specify maximum number of matches.
			useful for interactive things or completion.
    col('^')            column of first non-white character.
			Can use "len(substitute(getline('.'), '\S.*', '', ''))
			+ 1", but that's ugly.
7   Add patch from Benoit Cerrina to integrate Vim and Perl functions
    better.  Now also works for Ruby (2001 Nov 10)
-   Patch from Herculano de Lima Einloft Neto for better formatting of the
    quickfix window (2004 dec 2)
7   When 'rightleft' is set, the search pattern should be displayed right
    to left as well?  See patch of Dec 26. (Nadim Shaikli)
8   Option to lock all used memory so that it doesn't get swapped to disk
    (uncrypted).  Patch by Jason Holt, 2003 May 23.  Uses mlock.
7   Add ! register, for shell commands. (patch from Grenie)
8   In the gzip plugin, also recognize *.gz.orig, *.gz.bak, etc.  Like it's
    done for filetype detection.  Patch from Walter Briscoe, 2003 Jul 1.
7   Add a "-@ filelist" argument: read file names from a file. (David
    Kotchan has a patch for it)
8   Include a connection to an external program through a pipe?  See
    patches from Felbinger for a mathematica interface.
    Or use emacs server kind of thing?
7   Add ":justify" command.  Patch from Vit Stradal 2002 Nov 25.
-   findmatch() should be adjusted for Lisp.  See remark at
    get_lisp_indent().  Esp. \( and \) should be skipped. (Dorai Sitaram,
    incomplete patch Mar 18)
-   For GUI Find/Replace dialog support using a regexp.  Patch for Motif
    and GTK by degreneir (nov 10 and nov 18).
-   Patch for "paranoid mode" by Kevin Collins, March 7.  Needs much more work.


Vi incompatibility:
-   Try new POSIX tests, made after my comments. (Geoff Clare, 2005 April 7)
    Version 1.5 is in ~/src/posix/1.5. (Lynne Canal)
8   With undo/redo only marks in the changed lines should be changed.  Other
    marks should be kept.  Vi keeps each mark at the same text, even when it
    is deleted or restored. (Webb)
    Also: A mark is lost after: make change, undo, redo and undo.
    Example: "{d''" then "u" then "d''": deletes an extra line, because the ''
    position is one line down. (Veselinovic)
8   When stdin is not a tty, and Vim reads commands from it, an error should
    make Vim exit.
7   Unix Vim (not gvim): Typing CTRL-C in Ex mode should finish the line
    (currently you can continue typing, but it's truncated later anyway).
    Requires a way to make CTRL-C interrupt select() when in cooked input.
8   When loading a file in the .exrc, Vi loads the argument anyway.  Vim skips
    loading the argument if there is a file already.  When no file argument
    given, Vi starts with an empty buffer, Vim keeps the loaded file. (Bearded)
6   In Insert mode, when using <BS> or <Del>, don't wipe out the text, but
    only move back the cursor.	Behaves like '$' in 'cpoptions'.  Use a flag
    in 'cpoptions' to switch this on/off.
8   When editing a file which is a symbolic link, and then opening another
    symbolic link on the same file, Vim uses the name of the first one.
    Adjust the file name in the buffer to the last one used?  Use several file
    names in one buffer???
    Also: When first editing file "test", which is symlink to "test2", and
    then editing "test2", you end up editing buffer "test" again.  It's not
    logical that the name that was first used sticks with the buffer.
7   The ":undo" command works differently in Ex mode.  Edit a file, make some
    changes, "Q", "undo" and _all_ changes are undone, like the ":visual"
    command was one command.
    On the other hand, an ":undo" command in an Ex script only undoes the last
    change (e.g., use two :append commands, then :undo).
7   The ":map" command output overwrites the command.  Perhaps it should keep
    the ":map" when it's used without arguments?
7   CTRL-L is not the end of a section?  It is for Posix!  Make it an option.
7   Implement 'prompt' option.	Init to off when stdin is not a tty.
7   CTRL-T in Insert mode inserts 'shiftwidth' of spaces at the cursor.  Add a
    flag in 'cpoptions' for this.
7   Add a way to send an email for a crashed edit session.  Create a file when
    making changes (containing name of the swap file), delete it when writing
    the file.  Supply a program that can check for crashed sessions (either
    all, for a system startup, or for one user, for in a .login file).
7   Vi doesn't do autoindenting when input is not from a tty (in Ex mode).
7   "z3<CR>" should still use the whole window, but only redisplay 3 lines.
7   ":tag xx" should move the cursor to the first non-blank.  Or should it go
    to the match with the tag?	Option?
7   Implement 'autoprint'/'ap' option.
7   Add flag in 'cpoptions' that makes <BS> after a count work like <Del>
    (Sayre).
7   Add flag in 'cpoptions' that makes operator (yank, filter) not move the
    cursor, at least when cancelled. (default Vi compatible).
7   This Vi-trick doesn't work: "Q" to go to Ex mode, then "g/pattern/visual".
    In Vi you can edit in visual mode, and when doing "Q" you jump to the next
    match.  Nvi can do it too.
7   Support '\' for line continuation in Ex mode for these commands: (Luebking)
	g/./a\		    g/pattern1/ s/pattern2/rep1\\
	line 1\		    line 2\\
	line 2\		    line 3\\
	.		    line4/
6   ":e /tmp/$tty" doesn't work.  ":e $uid" does.  Is $tty not set because of
    the way the shell is started?
6   Vi compatibility (optional): make "ia<CR><ESC>10." do the same strange
    thing.  (only repeat insert for the first line).


GTK+ GUI known bugs:
9   Crash with X command server over ssh. (Ciaran McCreesh, 2006 Feb 6)
8   GTK 2: Combining UTF-8 characters not displayed properly in menus (Mikolaj
    Machowski)  They are displayed as separate characters.  Problem in
    creating a label?
8   GTK 2: Combining UTF-8 characters are sometimes not drawn properly.
    Depends on the font size, "monospace 13" has the problem.  Vim seems to do
    everything right, must be a GTK bug.  Is there a way to work around it?
9   Can't paste a Visual selection from GTK-gvim to vim in xterm or Motif gvim
    when it is longer than 4000 characters.  Works OK from gvim to gvim and
    vim to vim.  Pasting through xterm (using the shift key) also works.
    It starts working after GTK gvim loses the selection and gains it again.
-   Gnome2: When moving the toolbar out of the dock, so that it becomes
    floating, it can no longer be moved.  Therefore making it float has been
    blocked for now.


Win32 GUI known bugs:
-   Win32: tearoff menu window should have a scrollbar when it's taller than
    the screen.
8   On Windows 98 the unicows library is needed to support functions with UCS2
    file names.  Can we load unicows.dll dynamically?
8   The -P argument doesn't work very well with many MDI applications.
    The last argument of CreateWindowEx() should be used, see MSDN docs.
    Tutorial: http://win32assembly.online.fr/tut32.html
8   In eval.c, io.h is included when MSWIN32 is defined.  Shouldn't this be
    WIN32?  Or can including io.h be moved to vim.h? (Dan Sharp)
6   Win32 GUI: With "-u NONE -U NONE" and doing "CTRL-W v" "CTRL-W o", the ":"
    of ":only" is highlighted like the cursor.  (Lipelis)
8   When 'encoding' is "utf-8", should use 'guifont' for both normal and wide
    characters to make Asian languages work.  Win32 fonts contain both
    type of characters.
7   When font smoothing is enabled, redrawing can become very slow.  The reason
    appears to be drawing with a transparent background.  Would it be possible
    to use an opaque background in most places?
8   Use another default for 'termencoding': the active codepage.  Means that
    when 'encoding' is changed typing characters still works properly.
    Alternative: use the Unicode functions to obtain typed characters.
7   The cursor color indicating IME mode doesn't work properly. (Shizhu Pan,
    2004 May 9)
8   Win32: When clicking on the gvim title bar, which gives it focus, produces
    a file-changed dialog, after clicking on a button in that dialog the gvim
    window follows the mouse.  The button-up event is lost.  Only with
    MS-Windows 98?
    Try this: ":set sw ts", get enter-prompt, then change the file in a
    console, go back to Vim and click "reload" in the dialog for the changed
    file: Window moves with the cursor!
    Put focus event in input buffer and let generic Vim code handle it?
8   Win32 GUI: With maximized window, ":set go-=r" doesn't use the space that
    comes available. (Poucet)  It works OK on Win 98 but doesn't work on Win
    NT 4.0.  Leaves a grey area where the scrollbar was.  ":set go+=r" also
    doesn't work properly.
8   When Vim is minimized and when maximizing it a file-changed dialog pops
    up, Vim isn't maximized.  It should be done before the dialog, so that it
    appears in the right position. (Webb)
9   When selecting at the more-prompt or hit-enter-prompt, the right mouse
    button doesn't give popup menu.
    At the hit-enter prompt CTRL-Y doesn't work to copy the modeless
    selection.
    On the command line, don't get a popup menu for the right mouse button.
    Let the middle button paste selected text (not the clipboard but the
    non-Visual selection)?  Otherwise CTRL-Y has to be used to copy the text.
8   When 'grepprg' doesn't execute, the error only flashes by, the
    user can hardly see what is wrong. (Moore)
    Could use vimrun with an "-nowait" argument to only wait when an error
    occurs, but "command.com" doesn't return an error code.
8   When the 'shell' cannot be executed, should give an appropriate error msg.
    Esp. for a filter command, currently it only complains the file could not
    be read.
7   Add an option to add one pixel column to the character width?  Lucida
    Console italic is wider than the normal font ("d" overlaps with next char).
    Opposite of 'linespace': 'columnspace'.
7   At the hit-enter prompt scrolling now no longer works.  Need to use the
    keyboard to get around this.  Pretend <CR> was hit when the user tries to
    scroll?
7   Scrollbar width doesn't change when selecting other windows appearance.
    Also background color of Toolbar and rectangle below vert. scrollbar.
6   Drawing text transparently doesn't seem to work (when drawing part cursor).
8   CTRL key doesn't always work in combination with ALT key.  It does work
    for function keys, not for alphabetic characters.  Perhaps this is because
    CTRL-ALT is used by Windows as AltGr?
8   CTRL-- doesn't work for AZERTY, because it's CTRL-[ for QWERTY.  How do we
    know which keyboard is being used?
7   When scrolling, and a background color is dithered, the dither pattern
    doesn't always join correctly between the scrolled area and the new drawn
    area (Koloseike).
8   When gui_init_font() is called with "*", p_guifont is freed while it might
    still be used somewhere.  This is too tricky, do the font selection first,
    then set the new font by name (requires putting all logfont parameters in
    the font name).


Athena and Motif:
6   New Motif toolbar button from Marcin Dalecki:
    - When the mouse pointer is over an Agide button the red becomes black.
      Something with the way colors are specified in the .xpm file.
    - The pixmap is two pixels smaller than it should be.  The gap is filled
      with grey instead of the current toolbar background color.
9   Can configure be changed to disable netbeans if the Xpm library is
    required and it's missing?
8   When using the resource "Vim*borderwidth 2" the widgets are positioned
    wrong.
9   XIM is disabled by default for SGI/IRIX.  Fix XIM so that 'imdisable' can
    be off by default.
9   XIM doesn't work properly for Athena/Motif. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)  For now,
    keep XIM active at all times when the input method has the preediting
    flag.
8   X11: A menu that contains an umlaut is truncated at that character.
    Happens when the locale is "C", which uses ASCII instead of IS0-8859-1.
    Is there a way to use latin1 by default?  Gnome_init() seems to do this.
8   Perhaps use fontsets for everything?
6   When starting in English and switching the language to Japanese, setting
    the locale with ":lang", 'guifontset' and "hi menu font=", deleting all
    menus and setting them again, the menus don't use the new font.  Most of
    the tooltips work though...
7   Motif: when using a file selection dialog, the specified file name is not
    always used (when specifying a filter or another directory).
8   When 'encoding' is different from the current locale (e.g., utf-8) the
    menu strings don't work.  Requires conversion from 'encoding' to the
    current locale.  Workaround: set 'langmenu'.


Athena GUI:
9   The first event for any button in the menu or toolbar appears to get lost.
    The second click on a menu does work.
9   When dragging the scrollbar thumb very fast, focus is only obtained in
    the scrollbar itself.  And the thumb is no longer updated when moving
    through files.
7   The file selector is not resizable.  With a big font it is difficult to
    read long file names. (Schroeder)
4   Re-write the widget attachments and code so that we will not have to go
    through and calculate the absolute position of every widget every time the
    window is refreshed/changes size.  This will help the "flashing-widgets"
    problem during a refresh.
5   When starting gvim with all the default colors and then typing
    ":hi Menu guibg=cyan", the menus change color but the background of the
    pullright pixmap doesn't change colors.
    If you type ":hi Menu guibg=cyan font=anyfont", then the pixmap changes
    colors as it should.
    Allocating a new pixmap and setting the resource doesn't change the
    pullright pixmap's colors.  Why?  Possible Athena bug?


Motif GUI:
-   gui_mch_browsedir() is missing, browsedir() doesn't work nicely.
7   Use XmStringCreateLocalized() instead of XmStringCreateSimple()?
    David Harrison says it's OK (it exists in Motif 1.2).
8   Lesstif: When deleting a menu that's torn off, the torn off menu becomes
    very small instead of disappearing.  When closing it, Vim crashes.
    (Phillipps)


GUI:
9   On Solaris, creating the popup menu causes the right mouse button no
    longer to work for extending the selection. (Halevy)
9   When running an external program, it can't always be killed with CTRL-C.
    e.g., on Solaris 5.5, when using "K" (Keech).  Other 'guipty' problems on
    Solaris 2.6. (Marley)
9   On Solaris: Using a "-geometry" argument, bigger than the window where Vim
    is started from, causes empty lines below the cmdline. (raf)
8   X11 GUI: When menu is disabled by excluding 'm' from 'guioptions', ALT key
    should not be used to trigger a menu (like the Win32 version).
8   When setting 'langmenu', it should be effective immediately.  Store both
    the English and the translated text in the menu structure.  Re-generate
    the translation when 'langmenu' has changed.
8   Basic flaw in the GUI code: NextScreen is updated before calling
    gui_write(), but the GUI code relies on NextScreen to represent the state
    of where it is processing the output.
    Need better separation of Vim core and GUI code.
8   When fontset support is enabled, setting 'guifont' to a single font
    doesn't work.
8   Menu priority for sub-menus for: Amiga, BeOS.
8   When translating menus ignore the part after the Tab, the shortcut.  So
    that the same menu item with a different shortcut (e.g., for the Mac) are
    still translated.
8   Add menu separators for Amiga.
8   Add way to specify the file filter for the browse dialog.  At least for
    browse().
8   Add dialog for search/replace to other GUIs?  Tk has something for this,
    use that code?  Or use console dialog.
8   When selecting a font with the font dialog and the font is invalid, the
    error message disappears too quick.
7   More features in the find/replace dialog:
    - regexp on/off
    - search in selection/buffer/all buffers/directory
       when all buffers/directory is used:
	- filter for file name
       when directory is used:
	- subdirectory on/off
	- top directory browser
8   gui_check_colors() is not called at the right moment.  Do it much later,
    to avoid problems.
8   gui_update_cursor() is called for a cursor shape change, even when there
    are mappings to be processed.  Only do something when going to wait for
    input.  Or maybe every 100 ms?
8   X11: When the window size is reduced to fit on screen, there are blank
    lines below the text and bottom scrollbar.  "gvim -geometry 80x78+0+0".
    When the "+0+0" is omitted it works.
8   When starting an external command, and 'guipty' set, BS and DEL are mixed
    up.  Set erase character somehow?
8   A dead circumflex followed by a space should give the '^' character
    (Rommel).  Look how xterm does this.
    Also: Bednar has some code for dead key handling.
    Also: Nedit 5.0.2 with USE_XMIM does it right. (Gaya)
8   The compose key doesn't work properly (Cepas).  Both for Win32 and X11.
7   The cursor in an inactive window should be hollow.  Currently it's not
    visible.
7   GUI on Solaris 2.5.1, using /usr/dt/..: When gvim starts, cursor is
    hollow, after window lowered/raised it's OK. (Godfrey)
7   When starting GUI with ":gui", and window is made smaller because it
    doesn't fit on the screen, there is an extra redraw.
8   When setting font with .Xdefaults, there is an extra empty line at the
    bottom, which disappears when using ":set guifont=<Tab>". (Chadzelek)
8   When font shape changes, but not the size, doing ":set font=" does not
    redraw the screen with the new font.  Also for Win32.
    When the size changes, on Solaris 2.5 there isn't a redraw for the
    remaining part of the window (Phillipps).
-   Flashes really badly in certain cases when running remotely from a Sun.
4   Re-write the code so that the highlighting isn't changed multiple times
    when doing a ":hi clear".  The color changes happen three or more times
    currently.  This is very obvious on a 66Mhz 486.


MSDOS/DJGPP:
9   Pressing CTRL-C often crashes the console Vim runs in. (Ken Liao)
    When 'bioskey' isn't set it doesn't happen.  Could be a problem with the
    BIOS emulation of the console.  Version 5.6 already had this problem.
8   DJGPP: "cd c:" can take us to a directory that no longer exists.
    change_drive() doesn't check this.  How to check for this error?
9   The 16 bit version runs out of memory very quickly.  Should find unused
    code and reduce static data.  Resetting 'writebackup' helps to be able to
    write a file.
9   Crash when running on Windows 98 in a console window and pressing CTRL-C.
    Happens now and then.  When debugging Vim in gdb this also happens.  Since
    the console crashes, might be a bug in the DOS console.  Resetting
    'bioskey' avoids it, but then CTRL-C doesn't work.
9   DOS: Make CTRL-Fx and ALT-Fx work.
    CTRL-F1 = CE-5E, CTRL-F2 = CE-5F, .., CTRL-F10 = CE-67
    ALT-F1 = CE-68, ALT-F2 = CE-69, .., ALT-F10 = CE-71
    Shifted cursor keys produce same codes as unshifted keys.  Use bioskey(2)
    to get modifier mask for <S-C-M-Fx>.
    Use K_SPECIAL/KS_MODIFIER codes to insert modifier mask in input stream?
    Make this work like in Win32 console.
    Mapping things like <M-A> doesn't work, because it generates an extended
    key code.  Use a translation table?
9   Can't read an opened swap file when the "share" command has not been used.
    At least ignore the swap files that Vim has opened itself.
8   Use DJGPP 2.03.
8   The Dos32 version (DJGPP) can't use long file names on Windows NT.
    Check if new package can be used (v2misc/ntlfn08[bs].zip).
8   setlocale() is bogus.
8   Vim busy waits for new characters or mouse clicks.	Should put in some
    sort of sleep, to avoid eating 50% of the CPU time.  Test on an unpatched
    Windows 95 system!
8   DJGPP: when shell is bash, make fails. (Donahoe)
7   Hitting CTRL-P twice quickly (e.g., in keyword completion) on a 8088
    machine, starts printer echo! (John Mullin).
7   MSDOS 16 bit version can't work with COMSPEC that has an argument, e.g.:
    COMSPEC=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.COM /E:4096    (Bradley)
    Caused by BCC system() function (Borland "make" has the same problem).
8   Mouse: handle left&right button pressed as middle button pressed.  Add
    modifier keys shift, ctrl and alt.
7   When too many files are open (depends on FILES), strange things happen.
    The Dos16 version runs out of memory, in the Dos32 version "!ls" causes a
    crash.  Another symptom: .swp files are not deleted, existing files are
    "[New file]".
7   DJGPP version doesn't work with graphics display mode.  Switch to a mode
    that is supported?
8   DJGPP: ":mode" doesn't work for many modes.  Disable them.
8   DJGPP: When starting in Ex mode, shouldn't clear the screen. (Walter
    Briscoe)


MSDOS, OS/2 and Win32:
8   OS/2: Add backtick expansion.  Undefine NO_EXPANDPATH and use
    gen_expand_wildcards().
8   OS/2: Add clipboard support?  See example clipbrd.exe from Alexander
    Wagner.
8   OS/2: Add Extended Attributes support and define HAVE_ACL.
8   OS/2: When editing a file name "foo.txt" that is actually called FOO.txt,
    writing uses "foo.txt".  Should obtain the real file name.
8   Should $USERPROFILE be preferred above $HOMEDRIVE/$HOMEPATH?  No, but it's
    a good fallback, thus use:
	    $HOME
	    $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH
	    SHGetSpecialFolderPath(NULL, lpzsPath, CSIDL_APPDATA, FALSE);
	    $USERPROFILE
	    SHGetSpecialFolderPath(NULL, lpzsPath, CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA, FALSE);
	    $ALLUSERSPROFILE
	    $SYSTEMDRIVE\
	    C:\
8   Win32 console: <M-Up> and <M-Down> don't work. (Geddes)  We don't have
    special keys for these.  Should use modifier + key.
8   Win32 console: caps-lock makes non-alpha keys work like with shift.
    Should work like in the GUI version.
8   Environment variables in DOS are not case sensitive.  Make a define for
    STRCMP_ENV(), and use it when comparing environment var names.
8   Setting 'shellslash' has no immediate effect.  Change all file names when
    it is set/reset?  Or only use it when actually executing a shell command?
8   When editing a file on a Samba server, case might matter.  ":e file"
    followed by ":e FILE" will edit "file" again, even though "FILE" might be
    another one.  Set last used name in buflist_new()?  Fix do_ecmd(), etc.
8   When a buffer is editing a file like "ftp://mach/file", which is not going
    to be used like a normal file name, don't change the slashes to
    backslashes. (Ronald Hoellwarth)


Windows 95:
8   Editing a file by its short file name and writing it, makes the long file
    name disappear.  Setting 'backupcopy' helps.
    Use FindFirstFile()->cAlternateFileName in fname_case() (George Reilly).
8   Doing wildcard expansion, will match the short filename, but result in the
    long filename (both DJGPP and Win32).


Win32 console:
9   When editing a file by its short file name, it should be expanded into its
    long file name, to avoid problems like these: (Mccollister)
     1) Create a file called ".bashrc" using some other editor.
     2) Drag that file onto a shortcut or the actual executable.
     3) Note that the file name is something like BASHRC~1
     4) Go to File->Save As menu item and type ".bashrc" as the file name.
     5) Press "Yes" to indicate that I want to overwrite the file.
     6) Note that the message "File exists (add ! to override)" is displayed
	and the file is not saved.
    Use FindFirstFile() to expand a file name and directory in the path to its
    long name.
8   Also implement 'conskey' option for the Win32 console version?  Look at
    how Xvi does console I/O under Windows NT.
7   Re-install the use of $TERM and support the use of different terminals,
    besides the console.
8   Use of <altgr> modifier doesn't work?  5.3 was OK. (Garcia-Suarez/Guckes)
9   Mapping <C-S-Tab> doesn't work correctly.  How to see the difference with
    <C-S-i>?
9   tmpnam() uses file in root of file system: "\asdf".  That doesn't work on
    a Netware network drive.  Use same function as for Win32 GUI?
8   In os_win32.h, HAVE_STRICMP and HAVE_STRNICMP are defined only if __GNUC__
    is not defined.  Shouldn't that be the other way around?
7   Use SetConsoleCP() and SetConsoleOutputCP() to implement 'termencoding'?
    Avoids that input and output work differently.  Need to be restored when
    exiting.


Amiga:
8   In mch_inchar() should use convert_input_safe() to handle incomplete byte
    sequences.
9   In mch_expandpath() a "*" is to be expanded, but "\*" isn't.  Remove
    backslashes in result.
8   Executing a shell, only one option for 'shell' is separated.  Should do
    all options, using white space separation.


Macintosh:
-   GUI: gui_mch_browsedir() is missing.
7   Loading the Perl library only works on OS/X 10.2 or 10.3, never on both.
    Load the Perl library dynamically see Python sources file dynload_mac
    (Jack)
    dynamic linking: http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2064.html
8   inputdialog() doesn't resize when giving more text lines. (David Fishburn,
    2006 Sept 28)
8   Define vim_mkdir() for Macintosh.
8   Define mch_writable() for Macintosh.
9   When DiskLock is running, using a swap file causes a crash.  Appears to be
    a problem with writing a file that starts with a dot. (Giacalone)
9   In mac_expandpath() check that handling of backslashes is done properly.


"Small" problems:
-   Can't disable terminal flow control, to enable the use of CTRL-S and
    CTRL-Q.  Add an option for it?
-   When using e_secure in do_one_cmd() mention the command being executed,
    otherwise it's not clear where it comes from.
-   When the quickfix window is open and executing ":echo 'hello'" using the
    Command-line window, the text is immediately removed by the redrawing.
    (Michael Henry, 2008 Nov 1)
    Generic solution: When redrawing while there is a message on the
    cmdline, don't erase the display but draw over the existing text.
    Other solution, redraw after closing the cmdline window, before executing
    the command.
9   For Turkish vim_tolower() and vim_toupper() also need to use utf_
    functions for characters below 0x80. (Sertacyildiz)
9   When the last edited file is a help file, using '0 in a new Vim doesn't
    edit the file as a help file.  'filetype' is OK, but 'iskeyword' isn't,
    file isn't readonly, etc.
8   When an ":edit" is inside a try command and the ATTENTION prompt is used,
    the :catch commands are always executed, also when the file is edited
    normally.  Should reset did_emsg and undo side effects.  Also make sure
    the ATTENTION message shows up.  Servatius Brandt works on this.
7   Vimtutor leaves escape sequence in terminal. This is the xterm response to
    requesting the version number.  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
8   When redirecting and using ":silent" the current column for displaying and
    redirection can be different.  Use a separate variable to hold the column
    for redirection.
7   The messages for "vim --help" and "vim --version" don't use
    'termencoding'.
-   Could the hit-enter prompt be avoided when a message only overlaps the
    'showcmd' area?  Clear that area when the next cmd is typed.
8   When 'scrollbind' is set, a window won't scroll horizontally if the cursor
    line is too short.  Add a word in 'scrollopt' to allow moving the cursor
    to longer line that is visible.  A similar thing is done for the GUI when
    using the horizontal scrollbar.
7   VisVim can only open one file.  Hard to solve: each opened file is passed
    with a separate invocation, would need to use timestamps to know the
    invocations belong together.
8   When giving a ":bwipeout" command a file-changed dialog may popup for this
    buffer, which is pointless.  (Mike Williams)
8   On MS-Windows ":make" doesn't show output while it is working.  Use the
    tee.exe from  http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ ?  About 16 Kbyte in the
    UnxUtils.zip archive.
    Alternate one: http://www.pramodx.20m.com/tee_for_win32.htm, but Walter
    Briscoe says it's not as good.
8   When doing Insert mode completion a mapping cannot recursively call
    edit(), because the completion information is global.  Put everything in
    an allocated structure?
8   Command line completion: buffers "foo.txt" and "../b/foo.txt", completing
    ":buf foo<Tab>" doesn't find the second one. (George V. Reilly)
7   mb_off2cells() doesn't work correctly on the tail byte of a double-byte
    character. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)  It should return 1 when used on a tail
    byte, like for utf-8.  Store second byte of double-byte in ScreenLines2[]
    (like for DBCS_JPNU) and put a zero in the second byte (like for UTF-8).
7   Inside a function with "perl <<EOF" a line with "$i++" is recognized as an
    ":insert" command, causing the following "endfunction" not to be found.
    Add skipping this perl construction inside function definitions.
7   When 'ttimeoutlen' is 10 and 'timeoutlen' is 1000, there is a keycode
    "<Esc>a" and a mapping <Esc>x", when typing "<Esc>a" with half a second
    delay should not be interpreted as a keycode. (Hans Ginzel)
7   ":botright 1 new" twice causes all window heights to be changed.  Make the
    bottom window only bigger as much as needed.
7   The Cygwin and MingW makefiles define "PC", but it's not used anywhere.
    Remove? (Dan Sharp)
9   User commands use the context of the script they were defined in.  This
    causes a "s:var" argument to unexpectedly use a variable in the defining
    script, not the calling script.  Add an argument to ":command":
    "-keepcontext".  Do replace <SID>, so that a function in the defining
    script can be called.
8   The Japanese message translations for MS-Windows are called ja.sjis.po,
    but they use encoding cp932.  Rename the file and check that it still
    works.
8   A very long message in confirm() can't be quit.  Make this possible with
    CTRL-C.
8   "gf" always excludes trailing punctuation characters.  file_name_in_line()
    is currently fixed to use ".,:;!".  Add an option to make this
    configurable?
8   'hkmap' should probably be global-local.
9   When "$" is in 'cpoptions' and folding is active, a "C" command changes
    the folds and resets w_lines_valid.  The display updating doesn't work
    then. (Pritesh Mistry)
8   Using ":s" in a function changes the previous replacement string.  Save
    "old_sub" in save_search_patterns()?
8   Should allow multi-byte characters for the delimiter: ":s+a+b+" where "+"
    is a multi-byte character.
8   When appending to a file and 'patchmode' isn't empty, a backup file is
    always written, even when the original file already exists.
9   When getting focus while writing a large file, could warn for this file
    being changed outside of Vim.  Avoid checking this while the file is being
    written.
7   The message in bt_dontwrite_msg() could be clearer.
8   The script ID that is stored with an option and displayed with ":verbose
    set" isn't reset when the option is set internally.  For example when
    'foldlevel' is set from 'foldlevelstart'.
8   Also store the line number with the script ID and use it for ":verbose",
    so that "set nocompatible" is found when it changes other option values.
    When an option is set indirectly mention the command?  E.g. when
    ":diffsplit" sets 'foldmethod'.
8   In the fileformat dialog, "Cancel" isn't translated.  Add a global
    variable for this. (Eduardo Fernandez)
9   When editing a file with 'readonly' set, there is no check for an existing
    swap file.  Then using ":write" (without making any changes) doesn't give
    a warning either.  Should check for an existing swap file without creating
    one. Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 July 14.
7   When 'showbreak' is set, the amount of space a Tab occupies changes.
    Should work like 'showbreak' is inserted without changing the Tabs.
7   When 'mousefocus' is set and switching to another window with a typed
    command, the mouse pointer may be moved to a part of the window that's
    covered by another window and we lose focus.  Only move in the y
    direction, not horizontally?
8   ":hardcopy":
    - Using the cterm_color[] table is wrong when t_colors is > 16.
    - Need to handle unprintable characters.
    - Win32: On a B&W printer syntax highlighting isn't visible.  Perform
      dithering to make grey text?
    - Add a flag in 'printoptions' to add an empty page to make the total
      number even.  "addempty"? (Mike Williams)
    - Respect 'linebreak'.  Perhaps also 'showbreak'?
    - Should interpret CTRL-L as a page break.
    - Grey line numbers are not always readable.  Add field in 'printoptions'.
      Default to black when no syntax highlighting.
    - Be able to print a window in diff mode.
    - Be able to specify a colorscheme to use for printing.  And a separate
      one for B&W printing (if that can be detected).
8   In Visual block mode with 'lbr' set, a change command doesn't insert the
    text in following lines where the linebreak changes.
9   dosinst.c: The DJGPP version can't uninstall the Uninstall registry key on
    Windows NT.  How to install a .inf file on Windows NT and how to detect
    that Windows NT is being used?
8   When 'virtualedit' is "block,insert" and encoding is "utf-8", selecting a
    block of one double-wide character, then "d" deletes only half of it.
8   When 'virtualedit' is set, should "I" in blockwise visual mode also insert
    in lines that don't extend into the block?
8   With 'virtualedit' set, in Insert mode just after the end of line, CTRL-O
    yh does not yank the last character of the line. (Pavel Papushev)
    Doing "hl" first appears to make it work.
8   With 'virtualedit' set it's possible to move into the blank area from
    'linebreak'.
8   With 'virtualedit' set and 'selection' "exclusive", a Visual selection
    that ends in or after a tab, "d" doesn't delete (part of) the tab.
    (Helmut Stiegler)
9   When jumping to a tag, the search pattern is put in the history.  When
    'magic' is on, the pattern may not work.  Translate the pattern depending
    on p_magic when putting it in the history?  Alternative: Store value of
    'magic' in history.  (Margo)
9   optwin.vim: Restoring a mapping for <Space> or <CR> is not correct for
    ":noremap".  Add "mapcmd({string}, {mode})?  Use code from ":mkexrc".
9   incsearch is incorrect for "/that/<Return>/this/;//" (last search pattern
    isn't updated).
9   term_console is used before it is set (msdos, Amiga).
9   Get out-of-memory for ":g/^/,$s//@/" on 1000 lines, this is not handled
    correctly.  Get many error messages while redrawing the screen, which
    cause another redraw, etc.
8   [<C-I> doesn't work when '*' is in 'iskeyword'.  find_pattern_in_path()
    must escape special characters in the pattern.
8   Vim can overwrite a read-only file with ":w!".  ":w" can't overwrite an
    existing file, "w!" can, but perhaps not a read-only file?  Then use
    ":w!!" for that.
    Or ask for permission to overwrite it (if file can be made writable) and
    restore file to readonly afterwards.
    Overwriting a file for which a swap file exists is similar issue.
7   When compiled with "xterm_clipboard", startup can be slower and might get
    error message for invalid $DISPLAY.  Try connecting to the X server in the
    background (forked), so that Vim starts up quicker?  Connect as soon as
    the clipboard is to be used (Visual select mode starts, paste from
    clipboard)
7   X11: Some people prefer to use CLIPBOARD instead of PRIMARY for the normal
    selection.  Add an "xclipboard" argument to the 'clipboard' option? (Mark
    Waggoner)
8   For xterm need to open a connection to the X server to get the window
    title, which can be slow.  Can also get the title with "<Esc>[21t", no
    need to use X11 calls.  This returns "<Esc>]l{title}<Esc>\".
6   When the xterm reports the number of colors, a redraw occurs.  This is
    annoying on a slow connection.  Wait for the xterm to report the number of
    colors before drawing the screen.  With a timeout.
8   When the builtin xterm termcap contains codes that are not wanted, need a
    way to avoid using the builtin termcap.
8   Xterm sends ^[[H for <Home> and ^[[F for <End> in some mode.  Also
    recognize these keys?  Mostly useful for xterm simulators, like gnometerm.
    See http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_pc_style.
8   For xterm also recognize keypad up/down/left/right and insert.
8   '[ and '] should be set to start/end of line when using a linewise operator
    (e.g., ":w").
8   CTRL-A can't handle big "long" numbers, they become negative.  Check for
    "-" character, if not present, use unsigned long.
8   Make it possible to disable the special meaning of "#" in the first column
    for ">>".
8   Add suspending with CTRL-Z at the "more" prompt, and when executing a long
    script in do_cmdline().
8   When using 'hidden', many swap files will be open.  When Vim runs into the
    maximum number of open files, error messages will appear.  Detect that
    this problem is present, and close any hidden files that don't have
    changes.
8   With 'viminfo' set such that the ".viminfo" file is written on a FAT
    filesystem, an illegal file name may be created: ".vim".
8   For each buffer that is opened, the viminfo file is opened and read to
    check for file marks.  This can be slow.
7   In xterm, recognize both vt100 and vt220 cursor keys.  Change
    add_termcode() to not remove an existing entry for a name, when it's
    needed.
    Need a generic solution to recognize different codes for the same key.
8   Core dump within signal function: gdb doesn't show stack backtrace!  Option
    to skip catch_signals()?
9   Repeating a "cw" with "." doesn't work if the text was pasted from the
    clipboard. (Thomas Jones)  It's because the menu/toolbar item exits Insert
    mode and uses "gP".  How to fix this without breaking inserting a block of
    text?
8   In Replace mode pasting from the clipboard (using menu or toolbar) inserts
    all the text.  Add ":rmenu"?
8   Pasting with the mouse in Replace mode inserts the text, instead of
    overwriting, when it is more than one line.  Same for using <C-R>.
9   CTRL-E and CTRL-Y don't work in small window when 'so' is 4 and lines are
    wrapping (Acevedo/in.226).  E.g., when using CTRL-E, window height 7,
    window might actually scroll down when last line of buffer is displayed.
    --> Remember if the previous command was "cursor follows screen" or
    "screen follow cursor" and use this in cursupdate().
7   tilde_replace() can only handle "~/", should also do "~user/".
    Get the list of home directories (from /etc/passwd?  Use getpwent()) and
    use some clever algorithm to match a path with that.  Find common strings
    in the list?
8   When dragging status line with mouse, sometimes a jump when first clicking
    on the status line (caused by 'winheight').  Select window on button up,
    instead of on button down.
8   Dragging the status line doesn't scroll but redraw.
9   Evaluating 'statusline' in build_stl_str_hl() does not properly check for
    reaching the end of the available buffer.
    Patch to dynamically allocate the buffer for % items. (Eric Arnold, 2006
    May 14)
8   When performing incremental search, should abort searching as soon as a
    character is typed.
8   When the value of $MAKE contains a path, configure can't handle this.
    It's an autoconf bug.  Remove the path from $MAKE to work around it.
8   How to set VIMRC_FILE to \"something\" for configure?  Why does this not
    work: CFLAGS='-DVIMRC_FILE=\"/mydir/myfile\"' ./configure
8   The temporary file is sometimes not writable.  Check for this, and use an
    alternate name when it isn't.  Or add the 'temptemplate' option: template
    for the temp file name ":set temptemplate=/usr/tmp/?????.tmp".
    Also: Win32 version uses Windows temp directory, which might not work for
    cygwin bash.
7   Get error "*, \+ or \( operand could be empty" for pattern "\(.\)\1\{3}".
    Remember flags for backreferences.
7   When switching to Daylight Saving Time, Vim complains that a file has been
    changed since last read.  Can we use a function that uses GMT?
7   When completing an environment variable after a '$', check for file names
    that contain a '$' after all have been found.
8   When "cm" termcap entry is missing, starting gvim shouldn't complain about
    it. (Lohner)  Try out with "vt100" entry, cm replaced with cX.
7   When an include file starts with "../", the check for already visiting
    this file doesn't work.  Need to simplify the file name.
7   The names and comments for the arguments of do_browse() are confusing.
    "dflt" isn't the default file name when "initdir" is not NULL and
    "initdir" is the default path to be used.
7   When 'scrolloff' is exactly half the window height, "j" causes a scroll of
    two lines at a time.  "k" doesn't do this. (Cory T. Echols)
8   When write_viminfo() is used while there are many orphaned viminfo
    tempfiles writing the viminfo file fails.  Give a clear error message so
    that the user knows he has to delete the files.
7   It's possible to redefine a script-local function with ":func
    <SNR>123_Test()". (Krishna)  Disallow this.


I can't reproduce these (if you can, let me know how!):
9   NT 4.0 on NTFS file system: Editing ".bashrc" (drag and drop), file
    disappears.  Editing ".xyz" is OK.  Also, drag&drop only works for three
    files. (McCollister)


Problems that will (probably) not be solved:
-   GTK: when using the popup menu with spelling suggestions and releasing the
    right mouse button before the menu appears selecting an item with the
    right mouse button has no effect.  GTK does not produce an event for this.
-   GTK 2: Cannot use the file selector.  When using it many things become
    slow.  This is caused by some code in GTK that writes
    ~/.recently-used.xbel every time an event is handled.  It assumes the main
    loop is never quit, which is a wrong assumption.  Also, it overwrites the
    file with different file permissions, which is a privacy issue.  This
    needs to be fixed in GTK.  A solution in Vim would be really complicated.
    (2008 Jul 31)  This appears to be fixed in Vim 7.3.
-   xterm title: The following scenario may occur (esp. when running the Vim
    test script): Vim 1 sets the title to "file1", then restores the title to
    "xterm" with an ESC sequence when exiting.  Vim 2 obtains the old title
    with an X library call, this may result in "file1", because the window
    manager hasn't processed the "xterm" title yet.  Can apparently only be
    worked around with a delay.
-   In a terminal with 'mouse' set such that the mouse is active when entering
    a command line, after executing a shell command that scrolls up the
    display and then pressing ":": Selecting text with the mouse works like
    the display wasn't scrolled.  Vim doesn't know how much the external
    command scrolled up the display.  Use Shift to select text.
-   X windows: When $DISPLAY points to a X server where there is no access
    permission, trying to connect to the X server causes an error message.
    XtOpenDisplay() prints this directly, there is no way to avoid it.
-   X windows: Setting 'guifontset' to an illegal value sometimes crashes Vim.
    This is caused by a fault in a X library function, can't be solved in Vim.
-   Win32 tcl: has("tcl") hangs when the tcl84.dll is from cygwin.
-   Motif: When adding a menu item "Find this &Symbol", the "s" in "this" will
    be underlined, instead of in "Symbol".  Motif doesn't let us specify which
    character gets the highlighting.
-   Moving the cursor removes color in color-xterm.  This is a color-xterm
    problem!  color-xterm ver. 6.1 beta 3 and later work properly.
-   In zsh, "gvim&" changes the terminal settings.  This is a zsh problem.
    (Jennings)
-   Problem with HPterm under X: old contents of window is lost (Cosentino).
-   Amiga: When using quickfix with the Manx compiler we only get the first 25
    errors.  How do we get the rest?
-   Amiga: The ":cq" command does not always abort the Manx compiler.  Why?
-   Linux: A file with protection r--rw-rw- is seen readonly for others.  The
    access() function in GNU libc is probably wrong.
-   MSDOS: When using smartdrive with write-back buffering, writing to a
    readonly floppy will cause problems.  How to test for a writable floppy
    first?
-   MSDOS: Both 16 and 32 bit versions: File name expansion doesn't work for
    names that start with a dot.  These used to be illegal file names.
-   When doing a CTRL-Z and typing a command for the shell, while Vim is busy
    (e.g. writing a file), the command for the shell is sometimes eaten by Vim,
    because the terminal mode is changed from RAW to CBREAK.
-   An old version of GNU tgoto can't handle the terminfo code for "AF".  The
    "%p1" is interpreted as "%p" and "1", causing color not to be working.
    Fix: Change the "%p1" in the "AF" and "AB" terminfo entries to "%p".
    (Benzinger).
-   When running an external command from the GUI, typeahead is going to that
    program, not to Vim.  It looks like the shell eats the characters, Vim
    can't get back what the external command didn't use.
-   Win32 GUI: Error code from external command not returned in shell_error.
    It appears that cmd.exe and command.com don't return an error code.
-   Win32 GUI: The Toolbar is a bit too high when the flat style is being
    used.  We don't have control over the height of the Toolbar.
-   Win32: All files created on the day of switching from winter to summer
    time cause "changed since editing started" messages.  It goes away when
    the file is written again the next day, or the timezone is adjusted.
    DJGPP version is OK. (Zaimi)  Looks like a problem with the Win32 library.
    Rebooting doesn't help.  Time stamps look OK in directory. (Penn)
    Is this on FAT (stores wall clock time) or NTFS (stores UTS)?
-   Win32, MS-Windows XP: $HOME uses the wrong drive when the user profiles
    are not on the boot disk.  This is caused by a wrong value of $HOMEDRIVE.
    This is a bug in XP, see MSKB article 818134.
-   Win32, MS-Windows: expanding plugin/**/*.vim also picks up
    dir/ctags.vim,v.  This is because the short file name is something like
    "ctags~1.vim" and that matches the pattern.
-   SunOS 5.5.1 with Motif: The file open dialog does not have a horizontal
    scroll bar for the "files" selection.  This is a problem in the Motif
    libraries, get a patch from Sun.
-   Solaris 2.6 with GTK and Perl: gvim crashes when started.  Problem with X
    input method called from GDK code.  Without Perl it doesn't crash.
-   VMS: Vimdiff doesn't work with the VMS diff, because the output looks
    different.  This makes test 47 fail.  Install a Unix-compatible diff.
-   Win32 GUI: mouse wheel always scrolls rightmost window.  The events arrive
    in Vim as if the rightmost scrollbar was used.
-   GTK with Gnome: Produces an error message when starting up:
	Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library
    This is caused by the gnome library gnome_init() setting $LC_CTYPE to
    "en_US".  Not all systems support this locale name, thus causing the
    error.  Hopefully a newer version of GTK/Gnome fixes this problem.
-   GTK 2: With this mapping the hit-enter prompt is _sometimes_ below the
    screen, at other times there is a grey area below the command line:
	:nmap <F11> :if &guioptions=~'m' \| set guioptions-=m \| else \| set guioptions+=m \| endif<cr>
-   GTK: When pasting a selection from Vim to xclipboard gvim crashes with a
    ABRT signal.  Probably an error in the file gdkselection.c, the assert
    always fails when XmbTextListToTextProperty() fails. (Tom Allard)
-   GTK 2: gives an assertion error for every non-builtin icon in the toolbar.
    This is a GTK 2.4.x bug, fixed in GTK 2.4.2. (Thomas de Grenier de Latour)
-   When using an xterm that supports the termresponse feature, and the 't_Co'
    termcap option was wrong when Vim started, it will be corrected when the
    termresponse is received.  Since the number of colors changes, the
    highlighting needs to be initialized again.  This may cause colors defined
    in the vimrc file to be lost.
-   On Windows NT 4.0 the number of files passed to Vim with drag&drop and
    "Edit with Vim" is limited.  The maximum command line length is 255 chars.

---------------------  extensions and improvements ----------------------
						    *extensions-improvements*

Most interesting new features to be added when all bugs have been fixed:
-   Using ":exe edit fname" has escaping problems.  Use ":edit ++(fname)".
    Thus use "++=" to give arguments as expressions, comma separated as if
    calling a function.
    With options: ":edit ++(['!', '++enc=abc'], ['+/pat'], fname)".
    Alternative: Make a function for Ex commands: cmd_edit().
-   Add COLUMN NUMBERS to ":" commands ":line1,line2[col1,col2]cmd".  Block
    can be selected with CTRL-V.  Allow '$' (end of line) for col2.
-   Add DEBUGGER INTERFACE.  Implementation for gdb by Xavier de Gaye.
    Should work like an IDE.  Try to keep it generic.  Now found here:
    http://clewn.sf.net.
    And the idevim plugin/script.
    To be able to start the debugger from inside Vim: For GUI run a program
    with a netbeans connection; for console: start a program that splits the
    terminal, runs the debugger in one window and reconnect Vim I/O to the
    other window.
    Wishes for NetBeans commands:
    - make it possible to have 'defineAnnoType' also handle terminal colors.
    - send 'balloonText' events for the cursor position (using CursorHold ?)
      in terminal mode.
-   ECLIPSE plugin.  Problem is: the interface is very complicated.  Need to
    implement part in Java and then connect to Vim.  Some hints from Alexandru
    Roman, 2004 Dec 15.  Should then also work with Oracle Jdeveloper, see JSR
    198 standard http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=198.
    Eclim does it: http://eclim.sourceforge.net/  (Eric Van Dewoestine)
    Plugin that uses a terminal emulator: http://vimplugin.sf.net
    And another one: http://www.satokar.com/viplugin/index.php
-   STICKY CURSOR: Add a way of scrolling that leaves the cursor where it is.
    Especially when using the scrollbar.  Typing a cursor-movement command
    scrolls back to where the cursor is.
-   Scroll commands by screen line. g CTRL-E and g CTRL-Y ?  Requires the
    first line to be able to start halfway.
-   Running a shell command from the GUI still has limitations.  Look into how
    the terminal emulator of the Vim shell project can help:
    http://vimshell.wana.at
8   Add a command to jump to a certain kind of tag.  Allow the user to specify
    values for the optional fields.  E.g., ":tag size type=m".
    Also allow specifying the file and command, so that the result of
    taglist() can be used.
-   X11: Make it possible to run Vim inside a window of another program.
    This can be done with XReparentWindow().  But how exactly?


Documentation:
8   List of Vim runtime directories.  dotvim.txt from Charles Campbell, 2007
    Feb 20.
8   The GUI help should explain the Find and Find/Replace dialogs.  Add a link
    to it from ":promptrepl" and ":promptfind".
8   List of options should mention whether environment variables are expanded
    or not.
8   Extend usr_27.txt a bit. (Adam Seyfarth)
7   Add a section on debugging scripts in the user manual.
9   Make the Reference Manual more precise.  For each command mention:
    - change to cursor position and curswant
    - if it can be undone (u/CTRL-R) and redone (.)
    - how it works for folded lines
    - how it works with multi-byte characters
9   In change.txt, remark about Javadoc isn't right.  Right alignment would
    work too.
8   Spread the windows commands over the other files.  For example, ":stag"
    should be with ":tag".  Cross-link with tags to avoid too much double
    text.
8   Add tags for all features, e.g. "gui_running".
7   MS-Windows: When a wrong command is typed with an ALT key, give a hint to
    look at the help for 'winaltkeys'.
7   Add a help.vim plugin that maps <Tab> to jump to the next tag in || and
    <C-Tab> (and <S-Tab>) to the previous tag.
    Patch by Balazs Kezes, 2007 Dec 30.  Remark from A. Politz.
-   Check text editor compendium for vi and Vim remarks.


Help:
-   First try using the ":help" argument literally, before using it as a
    pattern.  And then match it as part of a tag.
-   When a help item has multiple matches make it possible to use ":tn" to go
    to the other matches.
-   Support a way to view (and edit) .info files.
-   Default mapping for help files: <Tab> to position cursor on next |:tag|.
-   Implement a "sticky" help window, some help text lines that are always
    displayed in a window with fixed height. (Guckes)  Use "~/.vimhelp" file,
    user can edit it to insert his favorite commands, new account can contain a
    default contents.
-   Make 'winminheight' a local option, so that the user can set a minimal
    height for the help window (and other windows).
-   ":help :s^I" should expand to ":help :substitute".
-   Make the help key (<F1>) context sensitive?
-   Learn mode: show short help while typing commands.


User Friendlier:
8   Windows install with install.exe: Use .exe instead of .bat files for
    links, so that command line arguments are passed on unmodified? (Walter
    Briscoe)
8   Windows install: Be able to associate Vim with a selection of file types?
8   Windows uninstall: Have uninstal.c delete the vimfiles directories that
    dosinst.c creates.  List the contents of the directory (recursively) if
    the user asks for it.  Requires an implementation of "rm -rf".
8   Remember the name of the vimrc file that was used (~/.vimrc, $VIM/_vimrc,
    $HOME/_vimrc, etc.) and add "edit vimrc" to the File menu.
-   Add a way to save local settings and mappings into a new plugin file.
    ":mkplugin <file>"?
8   Add ":plugininstall" command.  Can be used to install a plugin file that
    includes documentation.  Let the user select a directory from
    'runtimepath'.
	" Vim plugin
	<main plugin code>
	" >>> plugin help start <<<
	<plugin docs>
-   Add mappings local to a window: ":map <window> ..."?
9   Add buffer-local menu.  Should offer a choice between removing the menu or
    disabling it.  Be careful that tear-offs don't disappear (keep one empty
    item?).
    Alternative: use BufEnter and BufLeave autocommands.
8   make a vimtutor script for Amiga and other systems.
7   Add the arguments for configure to the ":version" output?
7   When Vim detects a file is being edited elsewhere and it's a gvim session
    of the same user it should offer a "Raise" button, so that the other gvim
    window can be displayed. (Eduard)
8   Support saving and restoring session for X windows?  It should work to do
    ":mksession" and use "-S fname" for the restart command.  The
    gui_x11_wm_protocol_handler() already takes care of the rest.
    global_event_filter() for GTK.


Tab pages:
9   GUI implementation for the tab pages line for other systems.
7   GUI: Control over the appearance of the text in the labels (bold, color,
    font, etc.)
8   Make GUI menu in tab pages line configurable.  Like the popup menu.
8   balloons for the tab page labels that are shortened to show the full path.
7   :tabdup	 duplicate the tab with all its windows.
7   Option to put tab line at the left or right?  Need an option to specify
    its width.  It's like a separate window with ":tabs" output.
7   Add local variables for each tab page?
8   Add local options for each tab page?  E.g., 'diffopt' could differ between
    tab pages.
7   Add local highlighting for each tab page?
7   Add local directory for tab pages?  How would this interfere with
    window-local directories?


Spell checking:
-   Support more regions? Caolan McNamara argues it's needed for es_XX.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=219777    
-   Unicode defines another quote character: 0x2019.  Use it as an equivalent
    of a single quote, thus use it as a word character like a quote and match
    with words, replacing the curly quote with a single quote.
-   Could filter &eacute; things for HTML before doing spell checking.
    Similarly for TeX.
-   The Hungarian spell file uses four extra characters in the FOL/UPP/LOW
    items than other spell files with the ISO-8859-2 encoding, that causes
    problem when changing 'spelllang'.  There is no obvious way to fix this.
-   Considering Hunspell 1.1.4:
    What does MAXNGRAMSUGS do?
    Is COMPLEXPREFIXES necessary when we have flags for affixes?
-   Support spelling words in CamelCase as if they were two separate words.
    Requires some option to enable it. (Timothy Knox)
-   There is no Finnish spell checking file.  For openoffice Voikko is now
    used, which is based on Malaga: http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/
    (Teemu Likonen)
8   ":mkspell" still takes much too long in Hungarian dictionary from
    hunspell.  Only solution appears to be to postpone secondary suffixes.
8   Handle postponed prefix with COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG or COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG.
    WFP_COMPPERMIT and WFP_COMPFORBID
8   implement use of <compoptions> in .spl file:
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDREP: when a compound word seems to be OK apply REP
    items and check if the result is a valid word.
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE
    Add CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE: when compounding make leading capital lower case.
    How is it supposed to work?
-   Add a command the repeats ]s and z=, showing the misspelled word in its
    context.  Thus to spell-check a whole file.
-   suggestion for "KG" to "kg" when it's keepcase.
-   For flags on affixes: Use a "AFFCOMPSET" flag; means the compound flags of
    the word are not used.
-   Support breakpoint character ? 0xb7 and ignore it?  Makes it possible to
    use same wordlist for hyphenation.
-   Compound word is accepted if nr of words is <= COMPOUNDWORDMAX OR nr of
    syllables <= COMPOUNDSYLMAX.  Specify using AND in the affix file?
-   NEEDCOMPOUND also used for affix?  Or is this called ONLYINCOMPOUND now?
    Or is ONLYINCOMPOUND only for inside a compound, not at start or end?
-   Do we need a flag for the rule that when compounding is done the following
    word doesn't have a capital after a word character, even for Onecap words?
-   New hunspell home page: http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/
    - Version 1.1.0 is out now, look into that.
    - Lots of code depends on LANG, that isn't right.  Enable each mechanism
      in the affix file separately.
    - Example with compounding dash is bad, gets in the way of setting
      COMPOUNDMIN and COMPOUNDWORDMAX to a reasonable value.
    - PSEUDOROOT == NEEDAFFIX
    - COMPOUNDROOT -> COMPOUNDED?  For a word that already is a compound word
	    Or use COMPOUNDED2, COMPOUNDED3, etc.
-   CIRCUMFIX: when a word uses a prefix marked with the CIRCUMFIX flag, then
    the word must also have a suffix marked with the CIRCUMFIX flag.  It's a
    bit primitive, since only one flag is used, which doesn't allow matching
    specific prefixes with suffixes.
    Alternative:
	PSFX {flag} {pchop} {padd} {pcond} {schop} {sadd}[/flags] {scond}
    We might not need this at all, you can use the NEEDAFFIX flag and the
    affix which is required.
-   When a suffix has more than one syllable, it may count as a word for
    COMPOUNDWORDMAX.
-   Add flags to count extra syllables in a word.  SYLLABLEADD1 SYLLABLEADD2,
    etc.?  Or make it possible to specify the syllable count of a word
    directly, e.g., after another slash: /abc/3
-   MORPHO item in affix file: ignore TAB and morphological field after
    word/flags and affix.
-   Implement multiple flags for compound words and CMP item?
    Await comments from other spell checking authors.

8   Charles Campbell asks for method to add "contained" groups to existing
    syntax items (to add @Spell).
    Add ":syntax contains {pattern} add=@Spell" command?  A bit like ":syn
    cluster" but change the contains list directly for matching syntax items.

8   It is currently not possible to mark "can not" as rare, because "can" and
    "not" are good words.  Find a way to let "rare" overrule "good"?
8   Make "en-rare" spell file?  Ask Charles Campbell.
8   The English dictionaries for different regions are not consistent in their
    use of words with a dash.
7   Insert mode completion mechanism that uses the spell word lists.
8   Add hl groups to 'spelllang'?
	:set spelllang=en_us,en-rare/SpellRare,en-math/SpellMath
    More complicated: Regions with different languages?  E.g., comments
    in English, strings in German (po file).


Diff mode:
9   When making small changes, e.g. deleting a character, update the diff.
    Possibly without running diff.
9   Instead invoking an external diff program, use builtin code.  One can be
    found here: http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/libmba/dl/src/diff.c
    It's quite big and badly documented though.
8   Use diff mode to show the changes made in a buffer (compared to the file).
    Use an unnamed buffer, like doing:
	new | set bt=nofile | r # | 0d_ | diffthis | wincmd p | diffthis
    Also show difference with the file when editing started?  Should show what
    can be undone. (Tom Popovich)
7   Add cursor-binding: when moving the cursor in one diff'ed buffer, also
    move it in other diff'ed buffers, so that CTRL-W commands go to the same
    location.


Folding:
    (commands still available: zI zJ zK zp zP zq zQ zV zy zY;
    secondary: zB zS zT zZ, z=)
8   Vertical folds: looks like vertically split windows, but the cursor moves
    through the vertical separator, separator moves when scrolling.
8   Add "z/" and "z?" for searching in not folded text only.
9   Add search pattern item to only match in closed or open fold and/or fold
    with certain level.  Allows doing ":g/pat/cmd" to work on closed folds.
8   When a closed fold is displayed open because of 'foldminlines', the
    behavior of commands is still like the fold is closed.  How to make the
    user aware of this?
8   Add an option 'foldskip' with values like 'foldopen' that specifies which
    commands skip over a closed fold.
8   "H" and "L" count buffer lines instead of window lines. (Servatius Brandt)
8   Add a way to add fold-plugins.  Johannes Zellner has one for VB.
7   When using manual folding, the undo command should also restore folds.
-   Allow completely hiding a closed fold.  E.g., by setting 'foldtext' to an
    empty string.  Require showing a character in 'foldcolumn' to avoid the
    missing line goes unnoticed.
    How to implement this?
-   When pressing the down arrow of a scrollbar, a closed fold doesn't scroll
    until after a long time.  How to make scrolling with closed folds
    smoother?
-   When creating a session, also store folds for buffers in the buffer list,
    using the wininfo in wi_folds.
-   When currently editing the first file in the argument list the session
    file can contain:
	args version.c main.c
	edit version.c
    Can editing version.c twice be avoided?
-   'foldmethod' "textobject": fold on sections and paragraph text objects.
-   "zuf": undo change in manual fold. "zUf" redo change in manual fold.  How
    to implement this?
-   "zJ" command: add the line or fold below the fold in the fold under the
    cursor.
-   'foldmethod' "syntax": "fold=3" argument: set fold level for a region or
    match.
-   Apply a new foldlevel to a range of lines. (Steve Litt)
8   Have some way to restrict commands to not folded text.  Also commands like
    searches.


Multi-byte characters:
-   When editing a file with both utf-8 and latin1 text Vim always falls back
    to latin1.  Add a command to convert the latin1 characters to utf-8?
	:unmix utf-8,latin1 filename
    Would only work when 'encoding' is utf-8.
9   When the tail byte of a double-byte character is illegal (e.g., a CR), the
    display is messed up (Yasuhiro Matsumoto).  Should check for illegal
    double-byte characters and display them differently (display each single
    byte).
9   'fenc' in modeline problem: add option to reload the file when 'fenc' is
    set to a different value in a modeline?  Option can be default on.  Could
    it be done with an autocommand?
8   Add an item in 'fileencodings' to check the first lines of a file for
    the encoding.  See Python PEP: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html.
    To avoid getting a wrong encoding only accept something Emacs-like:
    "-*- coding: enc-na_me.foo -*-" and "-*- coding= enc-na_me.foo -*-"
    Match with "-\*-\s*coding[:=]\s*\([::word::-_.]\+\)\s*-\*-" and use first
    item.
8   Add an item in 'fileencodings' to check the first line of an XML file for
    the encoding.  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  Or "charset=UTF-8"?
    For HTML look for "charset=utf-8".
8   The quickfix file is read without conversion, thus in 'encoding'.  Add an
    option to specify the encoding of the errorfile and convert it.  Also for
    ":grep" and ":helpgrep".
    More generic solution: support a filter (e.g., by calling a function).
8   When a file was converted from 'fileencoding' to 'encoding', a tag search
    should also do this on the search pattern. (Andrzej M. Ostruszka)
8   When filtering changes the encoding 'fileencoding' may not work.  E.g.,
    when using xxd and 'fileencoding' is "utf-16".  Add an option to set a
    different fileencoding for filter output?
7   When converting a file fails, mention which byte could not be converted,
    so that the user can fix the problem.
8   Add configure option to be able to disable using the iconv library. (Udo
    Schweigert)
9   'aleph' should be set to 1488 for Unicode. (Zvi Har'El)
8   Should add test for using various commands with multi-byte characters.
8   'infercase' doesn't work with multi-byte characters.
8   toupper() function doesn't handle byte count changes.
7   Searching and composing characters:
    When searching, should order of composing characters be ignored?
    Add a special item to match with a composing character, so that composing
    characters can be manipulated.
8   Should implement 'delcombine' for command line editing.
8   Detect overlong UTF-8 sequences and handle them like illegal bytes.
8   ":s/x/\u\1/" doesn't work, making uppercase isn't done for multi-byte
    characters.
8   UTF-8: "r" in Visual mode doesn't take composing characters.
8   UTF-8: When there is a precomposed character in the font, use it instead
    of a character and a composing character.  See xterm for an example.
7   When a character can't be displayed, display its digraph instead.
    'display' option to specify this.
7   Use ideas for nl_langinfo() from Markus Kuhn in enc_default():
    (www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/langinfo.c)
-   GTK and Win32: Allow selecting fonts for 'guifontset' with the
    fontselector somehow.
-   GTK and Win32: make it possible to set the font for the menu to make it
    possible to have 'encoding' different from the current locale.
-   dbcs_class() only works for Japanese and Korean.  Implement this for
    other encodings.  The "euc-jp" and "euc-kr" choices might be wrong.
-   Find some way to automatically select the right GUI font or fontset,
    depending on the default value of 'encoding'.
    Irrelevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI so long as UTF-8 is used.
    For Windows, the charset_pairs[] table could be used.  But how do we know
    if a font exists?
-   Do keyboard conversion from 'termencoding' to 'encoding' with
    convert_input() for Mac GUI.
-   Add mnemonics from RFC1345 longer than two characters.
    Support CTRL-K _{mnemonic}_
7   In "-- INSERT (lang) --" show the name of the keymap used instead of
    "lang". (Ilya Dogolazky)
-   Make 'breakat' accept multi-byte characters.  Problem: can't use a lookup
    table anymore (breakat_flags[]).
    Simplistic solution: when 'formatoptions' contains "m" also break a line
    at a multi-byte character >= 0x100.
-   Add the possibility to enter mappings which are used whenever normal text
    could be entered.  E.g., for "f" command.  But not in Normal mode.  Sort
    of opposite of 'langmap'.  Use ":tmap" command?
-   When breaking a line, take properties of multi-byte characters into
    account.  The "linebreak" program from Bruno Haible can do it:
    ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/linebreak-0.1.tar.gz
    But it's very complicated...


Printing:
7   Implement "undercurl" for printing.
-   Add "page width" to wrap long lines.
-   Win32: use a font dialog for setting 'printfont'.  Can reuse the code for
    the 'guifont' dialog, put the common code in a separate function.
-   Add the file timestamp to the page header (with an option). (George
    Reilly)
-   Win32: when 'printfont' is empty use 'guifont'.
-   Unix: Use some dialog box to do the obvious settings (paper size, printer
    name, portrait/landscape, etc).
-   PostScript: Only works for text that can be converted to an 8-bit
    character set.  How to support Unicode fully?
-   Allow specifying the paper size, instead of using a standard size.  Same
    units as for the margins.
-   Support right-to-left text?
8   Make the foreground color darkening function preserve the hue of the
    color.


Syntax highlighting:
8   Make ":syn off" use 'runtimepath' instead of $VIMRUNTIME. (Gary Johnson)
    Should do the same for ":syn on" and ":syn manual".
8   Support "containedin" argument for ":syn include", so that the defined
    cluster can be added to existing syntax items.
8   C syntax: Don't highlight {} as errors inside () when used like this:
    "({ something })", often used in GCC code.
7   Add a "startgroup" to a region.  Used like "nextgroup" inside the region,
    preferred item at the start of the region. (Charles Campbell)
8   When editing a new file without a name and giving it a name (by writing
    it) and 'filetype' is not set, detect the filetype.  Avoid doing it for
    ":wq file".
7   For "nextgroup" we have skipwhite, skipnl and skipempty.  It would be
    really nice to be able to skip with a pattern.  Or skip with a syntax
    group. (Nikolai Weibull, 2007 Feb 27)
8   Make conversion to HTML faster (Write it in C or pre-compile the script).
9   There is still a redraw bug somewhere.  Probably because a cached state is
    used in a wrong way.  I can't reproduce it...
7   Be able to change only the background highlighting.  Useful for Diff* and
    Search highlighting.
7   When 'number' is set highlight the number of the current line.
    Must be enabled with an option, because it slows down display updating.
8   Allow the user to add items to the Syntax menu sorted, without having to
    change this for each release.
8   Add a "matchcontains" for regions: items contained in the start or end
    pattern, but not in the body.
8   Add a "keepend-contained" argument: Don't change the end of an item this
    one is contained in.  Like "keepend" but specified on the contained item,
    instead of the containing item.
8   cpp.vim: In C++ it's allowed to use {} inside ().
8   Some syntax files set 'iskeyword'.  When switching to another filetype
    this isn't reset.  Add a special keyword definition for the syntax rules?
    When this is done, use vim.vim syntax highlighting for help file examples,
    but without ":" in 'iskeyword' for syntax.
    Also need a separate 'iskeyword' for the command line, e.g., in a help
    window ":e /asdf/asdf/" CTRL-W works different.
8   Add specific syntax item to match with parens/braces that don't have a
    "%" match.  :syntax nomatch cMatchError (,{,[,),},] [contained]
8   Highlight the text between two matching parens (e.g., with a grey
    background) when on one of the parens or in between them.
    Option for the matchparen plugin?
8   When using a cterm, and no ctermfg or ctermbg are defined, use start/stop
    sequences.	Add remark in docs that :if 'term' == "term-name" should be
    used.
8   Add @spell cluster to String and Comment groups for many languages.  Will
    allow spell checking. (Fleiner)
8   When listing syntax items, try to sort the keywords alphabetically.  And
    re-insert the [] if possible.
8   Make it possible to use color of text for Visual highlight group (like for
    the Cursor).
8   It would be useful to make the highlight group name an expression.  Then
    when there is a match, the expression would be evaluated to find out what
    highlight group to use.  Could be used to check if the shell used in a
    password file appears in /etc/shells. (Nikolai Weibull)
	syn match =s:checkShell(v:match) contained 'pattern'
8   Make it possible to only highlight a sub-expression of a match.  Like
    using "\1" in a ":s" command.
8   Support for deleting syntax items:
    :syn keyword cTodo remove this
    :syn match cTodo remove "pattern"
    :syn region cString remove start="this" end="that"
8   Add possibility to sync on something else, when the syncing in one way
    doesn't find match.  For HTML: When no {script} is found, try looking for
    a '<'.  (Fleiner)
7   Replace the synchronizing method with a state machine specification?
    Should be able to start at any line in the file, search forwards or
    backwards, and use the result of matching a pattern.
7   Use parsing like awk, so that e.g., a ( without a matching ) can be
    detected.
8   Make it possible to use "inverted" highlighting, invert the original
    character.  For Visual mode.  (xterm-selection already does this).
8   Highlight non-printable characters with "SpecialChar", linked to
    "Special".  Display them with the digraph characters, if possible.
8   Highlight the clipboard-selection with a highlight group.
8   Be able to reset highlighting to its original (default) values.
7   Be able to write current highlighting to a file as commands, similar to
    ":mkvimrc".
8   Improve c.vim:
    - Add check for unterminated strings, with a variable to switch it on:
      "c_strict_ansi".
    - Detect unbalanced "#endif".  Requires looking back a long way...
8   Add an option to restrict the updating of syntax highlighting to the
    current line while in Insert mode.
8   When guessing value of 'background', the syntax file has already been
    loaded (from the .gvimrc).	After changing 'background', load it again?
8   Add ":syn resync" command, to re-parse the whole file until the current
    display position.
8   Should support "me" offset for a region start pattern.  To be used to
    allow searching for the end pattern inside the match of the end pattern.
    Example: syn region pikeXX start="([^{]" end=")" should work on "()".
8   When using a regexp for "contains=", should delay matching with it until
    redrawing happens.  Set a flag when a group is added, check this flag when
    highlighting starts.
8   Some terminals can display colors like the GUI.  Add some setting to use
    GUI colors for the terminal?  With something to define the escape
    sequence.
7   It's possible for an item to be transparent, so that the colors of an item
    lower on the stack is used.  Also do this with highlighting, so that the
    user can set transparent highlighting?  E.g. a number in a C comment would
    get the color of a comment, a number in an assignment Normal. (Nikolai
    Weibull)
7   Add "semitrans": Add highlighting.  E.g., make the text bold, but keep the
    colors.  And add colors, so that Green+Red becomes Yellow.
    E.g. for this html:
	<B> bold text <I> italic+bold text </B> italic text </I>
7   CTRL-] checks the highlight group for finding out what the tag is.
7   Add an explanation how a list of words can be used to highlight misspelled
    words.
8   Add more command line completion for :syntax.
8   Add more command line completion for :highlight.
7   Should find a better way to parse the :syntax and :highlight commands.
    Use tables or lists that can be shared by parsing for execution and
    completion?
8   Add ColorSchemePost autocommand event, so that scripts can set up their
    highlighting. (Salman Halim)
7   Add a few sets of colors (e.g. Borland Turbo C one).  With a menu to
    select one of the sets.
8   Add offsets to sub-matches: "\(a*\) *"he=e1-1
    'e' is end of match 'e1' is end of sub-match 1, 's2' is start of submatch
    2, etc.
8   In Insert mode, when there are typeahead characters, postpone the
    highlighting (for "." command).
8   Syncing on comments isn't 100% correct when / / lines mix with / * and * /.
    For example: What about a line that starts with / / and contains * /?
8   Ignore / * and  * / inside strings, when syncing.
7   Build a few more syntax files from the file "/usr/share/misc/vgrindefs":
    ISP, LDL, Icon, ratfor.  And check "nedit/source/highlight.c".
6   Add possibility to have background color continue until the right edge of
    the window.  Useful for comment blocks and function headings. (Rogall)
-   Make it possible to add "contains" items for all items in a group.	Useful
    when extending an already existing syntax file.
-   Add line-continuation pattern for non-syncing items too?
-   Add possibility to highlight the whole line, including the right margin
    (for comment blocks).
-   Add 'hlmatch' option: List of flags:
    'c': highlight match for character under the cursor.
    'b': highlight the previous (, and its match.
    'a': highlight all text from the previous ( until its match.
	 Also for {}, <>, etc.?
    'e': highlight all braces without a match (slow?)
    OR: add an argument "cursor" to the syntax command, which means that the
    region/match/keyword is only highlighted when the cursor is on it.
    (Campbell)
    Or do it like Elvis: define text objects and how to highlight them around
    the cursor. (Iain Truskett)
7   Make it possible to use all words in the tags files as Keyword.
    Can also be done with a script (but it's slow).
7   Make it possible to call a ":" command when a match is found.  Should
    allow for adding keywords from the text (e.g. variables that are set).
    And allows for sections with different highlighting.
7   Add highlight group for commandline: "Commandline".  Make sure it
    highlights the command line while typing a command, and any output from
    messages.  And external commands?
8   Make a version that works like less, but with highlighting: read stdin for
    text, exit at end of file, don't allow editing, etc.  moreim?  lessim?
7   SpecialKey highlighting overrules syntax highlighting.  Can't give an
    unprintable char another color.  Would be useful for ^M at end of line.


Built-in script language:
8   Make the filename and line number available to script functions, so that
    they can give useful debugging info.  The whole call stack would be ideal.
    At least use this for error messages.
7   Execute a function with standard option values.  No need to save and
    restore option values.  Especially useful for new options.  Problem: how
    to avoid a performance penalty (esp. for string options)?
8   Add referring to key options with "&t_xx".  Both for "echo &t_xx" and
    ":let &t_xx =".  Useful for making portable mappings.
-   Add ":let var ?= value", conditional assignment.  Patch by Dave Eggum,
    2006 Dec 11.
-   range for ":exec", pass it on to the executed command.  (Webb)
8   ":{range}source": source the lines from the current file.
	You can already yank lines and use :@" to execute them.
	Most of do_source() would not be used, need a new function.
	It's easy when not doing breakpoints or profiling.
    Requires copying the lines into a list and then creating a function to
    execute lines from the list.  Similar to getnextac().
7   ":include" command: just like ":source" but doesn't start a new scriptID?
    Will be tricky for the list of script names.
8   Have a look at VSEL.  Would it be useful to include? (Bigham)
8   Add ":fungroup" command, to group function definitions together.  When
    encountered, all functions in the group are removed.  Suggest using an
    obscure name to avoid name clashes.  Require a ":fungroup END" in the same
    sourced file?  Assume the group ends at the end of the file.  Handle
    nested packages?
    Alternative: Support packages.  {package-name}:{function-name}().
    Packages are loaded automatically when first used, from
    $VIMRUNTIME/packages (or use a search path).
7   Pre-parse or compile Vim scripts into a bytecode.
    1. Put the bytecode with the original script, with an ":if
       has('bytecode')" around it, so that it's only used with a Vim that
       supports it.  Update the code with a command, can be used in an
       autocommand.
    2. Use a ".vic" file (like Python use .pyc).  Create it when writing a
       .vim file.  Problem: distribution.
    3. Use a cache directory for each user.  How to recognize which cached
       file belongs to a sourced script?
7   Add argument to winwidth() to subtract the space taken by 'foldcolumn',
    signs and/or 'number'.
6   Add ++ and -- operators?  They only work on variables (lvals), how to
    implement this?
8   Add functions:
	has(":command")		Check if ":command" works.  compare function
				with "ex_ni".  E.g. for ":simalt".
	system()		With a List argument.  Bypasses the shell, use
				exec() directly.  (Bob Hiestand)
	escape()		Add argument to specify what to escape with.
	modestack()		Instead of just the current mode return the
				stack of Insert / CTRL-O / :normal things.
	realname()		Get user name (first, last, full)
				user_fullname() patch by Nikolai Weibull, Nov
				3 2002
				Only add this when also implemented for
				non-Unix systems, otherwise a shell cmd could
				be used.
				get_user_name() gets login name.
	menuprop({name}, {idx}, {what})
				Get menu property of menu {name} item {idx}.
				menuprop("", 1, "name") returns "File".
				menuprop("File", 1, "n") returns "nmenu
				File.Open..." argument.
				Patch by Ilya Sher, 2004 Apr 22
				Return a list of menus and/or a dictionary
				with properties instead.
	mapname({idx}, mode)	return the name of the idx'th mapping.
				Patch by Ilya Sher, 2004 Mar 4.
				Return a list instead.
	char2hex()		convert char string to hex string.
	crypt()			encrypt string
	decrypt()		decrypt string
	base64enc()		base 64 encoding
	base64dec()		base 64 decoding
	attributes()		return file protection flags "drwxrwxrwx"
	filecopy(from, to)	Copy a file
	shorten(fname)		shorten a file name, like home_replace()
	perl(cmd)		call Perl and return string
	inputrl()		like input() but right-to-left
	typed()			return the characters typed and consumed (to
				find out what happened)
	virtualmode()		add argument to obtain whether "$" was used in
				Visual block mode.
	getacp()		Win32: get codepage (Glenn Maynard)
	deletebufline()		delete line in any buffer
	appendbufline()		append line in any buffer
	libcall()		Allow more than one argument.
	libcallext()		Like libcall(), but using a callback function
				to allow the library to execute a command or
				evaluate an expression.
7   Make bufname("'0") return the buffer name from mark '0.  How to get the
    column and line number?  col("'0") currently returns zero.
8   argc() returns 0 when using "vim -t tag".  How to detect that no file was
    specified in any way?  To be able to jump to the last edited file.
8   Pass the command line arguments to Vim scripts in some way.  As v:args
    List?  Or extra parameter to argv()?
8   Add command arguments with three dashes, passed on to Vim scripts.
7   Add optional arguments to user functions:
	:func myFunc(arg1, arg2, arg3 = "blah", arg4 = 17)
6   User functions: Functions local to buffer "b:func()"?
8   For Strings add ":let var[{expr}] = {expr}".  When past the end of "var"
    just ignore.
8   The "= register should be writable, if followed by the name of a variable,
    option or environment variable.
8   ":let &option" should list the value of the option.
8   ":let Func().foo = value" should work, also when "foo" doesn't exist.
    Also: ":let Func()[foo] = value" should work.  Same for a List.
7   Add synIDlist(), making the whole list of syntax items on the syntax stack
    available as a List.
8   Add autocommand-event for when a variable is changed:
	:au VarChanged {varname} {commands}
8   Add "has("gui_capable")", to check if the GUI can be started.
8   Add possibility to use variables like registers: characterwise (default),
    linewise (when ending in '\n'), blockwise (when ending in '\001').	reg0,
    rega, reg%, etc.  Add functions linewise({expr}), blockwise({expr}) and
    charwise({expr}).
7   Make it possible to do any command on a string variable (make a buffer
    with one line, containing the string).  Maybe add an (invisible) scratch
    buffer for this?
	result = scratch(string, command)
	result = apply(string, command)
	result = execute(string, command)
    "command" would use <> notation.
    Does scratch buffer have a number?  Or re-use same number?
7   Add function to generate unique number (date in milliseconds).


Robustness:
6   Add file locking.  Lock a file when starting to edit it with flock() or
    fcntl().  This patch has advisory file locking while reading/writing
    the file for Vim 5.4: ~/vim/patches/kahn_file_locking .
    The patch is incomplete (needs support for more systems, autoconf).
    Andy doesn't have time to work on it.
    Disadvantage: Need to find ways to gracefully handle failure to obtain a
    lock.  When to release a lock: When buffer is unloaded?


Performance:
7   For string variables up to 3 bytes don't allocate memory, use v_list
    itself as a character array.  Use VAR_SSTRING (short string).
7   Add 'lazysize' option: Above this size Vim doesn't load everything before
    starting to edit a file.  Things like 'fileencodings' only work up to this
    size, modelines only work at the top.  Useful for large log files where
    you only want to look at the first few pages.  Use zero to disable it.
8   move_lines() copies every line into allocated memory, making reloading a
    buffer a lot slower than re-editing the file.  Can the memline be locked
    so that we don't need to make a copy?  Or avoid invoking ml_updatechunk(),
    that is taking a lot of time.  (Ralf Wildenhues, 2008 Jul 7)
    With a patch, but does it work?
8   Instead of loading rgb.txt every time a color wasn't recognized load it
    once and keep it in memory.  Move the code to a common place to avoid
    repeating it in various system files.
8   Turn b_syn_ic and b_syn_containedin into b_syn_flags.
9   Loading menu.vim still takes quite a bit of time.  How to make it faster?
8   in_id_list() takes much time for syntax highlighting.  Cache the result?
7   setpcmark() shifts the jumplist, this takes quite a bit of time when
    jumping around.  Instead use an index for the start?
8   When displaying a space with only foreground highlighting, it's the same
    as a space without attributes.  Avoid displaying spaces for the "~" lines
    when starting up in a color terminal.
8   Avoid alloc() for scratch buffer use, esp. in syntax.c.  It's very slow on
    Win16.
8   Profiling shows that in_id_list() is used very often for C code.  Can this
    function be improved?
8   For an existing file, the page size of the swap file is always the
    default, instead of using the block size of the device, because the swap
    file is created only after setting the block size in mf_open().  How can
    this be improved?
8   Set default for 'ttyscroll' to half a screen height?  Should speed up
    MS-DOS version. (Negri)
7   C syntax highlighting gets a lot slower after ":set foldmethod=syntax".
    (Charles Campbell)  Inserting a "{" is very slow. (dman)
7   HTML syntax highlighting is slow for long lines.  Try displaying
    http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22908.html. (Andre Pang)
7   Check how performance of loading the wordlist can be improved (adding a
    lot of abbreviations).
7   MS-DOS console: Add t_DL support, to make scrolling faster.
7   Compile Ex commands to byte codes.  Store byte codes in a vim script file
    at the end, after "compiled:.  Make it look like a single comment line
    for old Vim versions.  Insert first line "Vim script compiled <timestamp>.
    Only used compiled code when timestamp matches the file stat.
    Add command to compile a vim script and add it to the file in-place.
    Split Ex command executing into a parsing and executing phase.
    Use compiled code for functions, while loops, etc.
8   When defining autocommands (e.g., from $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim), need to
    compare each pattern with all existing patterns.  Use a hash code to avoid
    using strcmp() too often?
7   Include turbo_loader patches, speeding up reading a file?
    Speed up reading a file by reading it into a fixed-size buffer, creating
    the list of indexes in another buffer, and then copying the result into a
    memfile block with two copies.  Then read the next block into another
    fixed-size buffer, create the second list of indexes and copy text from
    the two blocks to the memfile block.
7   do_cmdline(): Avoid that the command line is copied to allocated memory
    and freed again later all the time.  For while loops, and for when called
    with an argument that can be messed with.
    Generic solution: Make a struct that contains a pointer and a flag that
    indicates if the pointer should be freed when replaced.
7   Check that the file size is not more than "sizeof(long)".
-   Further improve finding mappings in maphash[] in vgetorpeek()
8   Syntax highlighting is slow when deleting lines.  Try in
    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim.
-   "out of memory" after deleting (1,$d) and changing (:%s/^/> /) a lot of
    lines (27000) a few times.  Memory fragmentation?
-   Have a look at how pdksh does memory allocation (alloc.c). (Dalecki)
-   Do profiling on:
    - :g/pat/normal cmd
    - 1000ii<Esc>
    - deleting 10Mbyte worth of lines (netscape binary)
    - "[i" and "[d" (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
    - ":g/^/m0" on a 450Kbyte file.  And the "u".
    - highlighting "~/vim/test/longline.tex", "~/vim/test/scwoop.tcl" and
      "~/vim/test/lockup.pl".
    - loading a syntax file to highlight all words not from a dictionary.
    - editing a Vim script with syntax highlighting on (loading vim.vim).
7   Screen updating can be further improved by only redrawing lines that were
    changed (and lines after them, when syntax highlighting was used, and it
    changed).
    - On each change, remember start and end of the change.
    - When inserting/deleting lines, remember begin, end, and line count.
-   Use macros/duarte/capicua for profiling.  Nvi 1.71 is the fastest!
-   When using a file with one long line (1Mbyte), then do "$hhhh", is still
    very slow.  Avoid calling getvcol() for each "h"?
-   Executing a register, e.g. "10000@@" is slow, because ins_typebuf has to
    move the previous commands forward each time.  Pass count from
    normal_cmd() down to do_execreg().
-   Repeating insert "1000i-<Esc>" displays --INSERT-- all the time, because of
    the <Esc> at the end.  Make this work faster (disable redrawing).
-   Avoid calls to plines() for cursor line, use w_cline_height.
-   After ":set nowrap" remove superfluous redraw with wrong hor. offset if
    cursor is right of the screen.
8   Make CTRL-C on Unix generate a signal, avoid using select() to check for a
    CTRL-C (it's slow).


Code size:
8   GUI: When NO_CONSOLE is defined, more code can be excluded.
-   Put getline() and cookie in a struct, so only one argument has to be
    passed to do_cmdline() and other functions.
8   Make a GUI-only version for Unix?
8   In buf_write _() isn't needed when setting errmsg, do it once when using
    it.
7   When compiling with a GUI-only version, the code for cterm colors can be
    left out.
8   When compiled with a GUI-only version, the termcap entries for terminals
    can be removed.
8   Can the check for libelf in configure.in be removed?


Messages:
8   When using ":q" in a changed file, the error says to "add !".  Add the
    command so that beginners understand it: "use :q!".
8   For 'verbose' level 12 prints commands from source'ed files.  How to skip
    lines that aren't executed?  Perhaps move the echoing to do_cmdline()?
8   Use 'report' for ":bdel"?  (Krishna)  To avoid these messages when using a
    script.
-   Delete message after new command has been entered and have waited for key.
    Perhaps after ten seconds?
-   Make message history available in "msg" variables: msg1, msg2, .. msg9.
8   When reading from stdin allow suppressing the "reading from stdin"
    message.
9   Check handling of overwriting of messages and delays:
    Very wrong: errors while redrawing cause endless loop.
    When switching to another file and screen scrolls because of the long
    message and return must be typed, don't scroll the screen back before
    redrawing.
8   When address range is wrong you only get "Invalid range".  Be a bit more
    specific: Negative, beyond last line, reverse range?  Include the text.
8   Make it possible to ignore errors for a moment ('errorignore'?).  Another
    option to switch off giving error messages ('errorquiet'?).  Also an option
    not to give any messages ('quiet')?  Or ":quiet on", ":quiet off".
    Careful: For a severe error (out of memory), and when the user starts
    typing, error messages must be switched back on.
    Also a flag to ignore error messages for shell commands (for mappings).
-   Option to set time for emsg() sleep.  Interrupt sleep when key is typed?
    Sleep before second message?
8   In Ex silent mode or when reading commands from a file, what exactly is
    not printed and what is?  Check ":print", ":set all", ":args", ":vers",
    etc.  At least there should be no prompt. (Smulders)  And don't clear the
    screen when reading commands from stdin. (Kendall)
    --> Make a difference between informative messages, prompts, etc. and
	error messages, printing text, etc.
8   Window should be redrawn when resizing at the hit-enter prompt.
    Also at the ":tselect" prompt.  Find a generic solution for redrawing when
    a prompt is present (with a callback function?).


Screen updating:
7   Add a string to the 'display' option to make CTRL-E and CTRL-Y scroll one
    screen line, also if this means the first line doesn't start with the
    first character (like what happens with a single line that doesn't fit).
-   screen_line():
    - insert/delete character stuff.
    - improve delete rest of line (spaces at end of line).
-   When moving or resizing window, try to avoid a complete redraw (esp. when
    dragging the status line with the mouse).
-   When 'lazyredraw' set, don't echo :ex commands?  Need a flag to redraw when
    waiting for a character.
8   Add a ":refresh [winnr]" command, to force updating a window.  Useful from
    an event handler where ":normal" can't be used.  Also useful when
    'lazyredraw' is set in a mapping.
7   Make 'list' and 'linebreak' work together.


Scrolling:
8   Add "zy" command: scroll horizontally to put the cursor in the middle.
6   Add option to set the overlap for CTRL-F and CTRL-B. (Garhi)
-   extend 'scrollbind' option: 'scrollopt' words "search", "relative", etc..
    Also 'e'xecute some commands (search, vertical movements) in all bound
    windows.
7   Add 'scrollbind' feature to make the offset of one window with the next
    one equal to the window height.  When editing one file in both windows it
    looks like each window displays a page of the buffer.
-   Allow scrolling by dragging with the mouse (grab a character and move it
    up/down).  Like the "hand" in Acrobat reader.  Use Alt-LeftMouse for this?
    (Goldfarb)
-   Add command to execute some commands (search, vertical movements) in all
    bound windows.
-   Add 'search' option to 'scrollopt' to allow 'scrollbind' windows to
    be bound by regexp searches
-   Add "z>" and "z<": scroll sideways one screenful. (Campbell)
-   Add option to set the number of lines when not to scroll, instead of the
    fixed number used now (for terminals that scroll slow with a large number
    of lines but not with a single line).


Autoconf:
8   Should use acconfig.h to define prototypes that are used by autoheader.
8   Some compilers don't give an error for "-OPT:Olimit" but a warning. (Webb)
    Add a check for the warning, so that "Olimit" can be added automatically?
-   Autoconf: Use @datadir@ for the system independent files.  Make sure the
    system dependent and system independent files are separated. (Leitner).
-   Add autoconf check for waitpid()/wait4().
-   Remove fcntl() from autoconf, all systems have it?
-   Set default for 'dictionary', add search for dictionary to autoconf.


Perl interface:
8   Rename typemap file to something else?
7   Make buffers accessed as Perl arrays. (Clark)
7   Make it possible to compile with non-ANSI C?
6   Tcl/Tk has the "load" command: load a shared library (.so or .dll).


Shared libraries:
6   Add support for loading shared libraries, and calling functions in it.
	:libload internal-name libname
	:libunload internal-name
	:liblist
	:libcall internal-name function(arg1, arg2, ...)
	:libcall function(arg1, arg2, ...)
    libcall() can have only one integer or String argument at the moment.
6   Have a look on how Perl handles loading dynamic libraries.


Tags:
9   With ":set tags=./tags,../tags" and a tag appears in both tags files it is
    added twice.  Requires figuring out the actual file name for each found
    match.  Remove tag_fname from the match and combine it with the fname in
    the match (without expanding or other things that take time).  When
    'tagrelative' is off tag_fname isn't needed at all.
8   For 'tags' wildcard in the file name is not supported, only in the path.
    This is due to it using |file-searching|. Suboptimal solution would be to
    make the filename or the whole option use |wildcards| globing, better
    would be to merge the 2 kinds of globing. originally (Erik Falor, 2008
    April 18), updated (Ian Kelling, 2008 July 4)
7   Can CTRL-] (jump to tag) include a following "." and "->" to restrict the
    number of possible matches? Check tags file for an item that has members.
    (Flemming Madsen)
8   Scope arguments for ":tag", e.g.: ":tag class:cPage open", like Elvis.
8   When output of ":tselect" is long, getting the more-prompt, should be able
    to type the tag number directly.
7   Add the possibility to use the "-t {tag}" argument multiple times.  Open a
    window for each tag.
7   Make output of ":tselect" a bit nicer.  Use highlighting?
7   Highlight the "tag 1 of >2" message.  New highlight group, or same as "hit
    bottom" search message.
7   When using ":tag" at the top of the tag stack, should add another entry,
    so CTRL-T can bring you back to where you are now AND to where you were
    before the previous ":tag" command. (Webb)
-   When doing "[^I" or "[^D" add position to tag stack.
-   Add command to put current position to tag stack: ":tpush".
-   Add functions to save and restore the tag stack?  Or a command to switch
    to another tag stack?  So that you can do something else and come back to
    what you were working on.
7   When using CTRL-] on someClass::someMethod, separate class from method and
    use ":ta class:someClass someMethod".
    Include C++ tags changes (Bertin).	Change "class::func" tag into "func"
    with "class=class"?  Docs in oldmail/bertin/in.xxx.
7   Add ":tagargs", to set values for fields:
	:tagargs class:someclass file:version.c
	:tagargs clear
    These are then the default values (changes the order of priority in tag
    matching).
7   Support for "gtags" and "global"?  With ":rtag" command?
    There is an example for how to do this in Nvi.
    Or do it like Elvis: 'tagprg' and 'tagprgonce' options. (Yamaguchi)
    The Elvis method is far more flexible, do it that way.
7   Support "col:99" extra field, to position the cursor in that column.  With
    a flag in 'cpoptions' to switch it off again.
7   Better support for jumping to where a function or variable is used.  Use
    the id-utils, with a connection to "gid" (Emacs can do it too).  Add
    ":idselect", which uses an "ID" database (made by "mkid") like "tselect".


Win32 GUI:
8   Make debug mode work while starting up (vim -D).  Open console window for
    the message and input?
7   GvimExt: when there are several existing Vims, move the list to a submenu.
    (Mike McCollister)
8   When using "Edit with Vim" for one file it changes directory, when several
    files are selected and using "Edit with single Vim" the directory isn't
    changed.  At least change directory when the path is the same for all
    files.  Perhaps just use the path of the first file or use the longest
    common part of the path.
8   Add font argument to set the lfCharSet. (Bobcik)
8   Somehow automatically detect the system language and set $LANG, so that
    gettext and menus work.
8   Could keep console open to run multiple commands, to avoid the need to hit
    return in every console.
    Also: Look at how Emacs does run external commands:
	http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html.
8   Need a separate PopUp menu for modeless selection.  Need two new commands:
    Copy selection to clipboard, Paste selection (as typed text).
8   Support copy/paste for other file formats.  At least HTML, perhaps RTF.
    Add "copy special" and "paste special" commands?
7   Use different default colors, to match the current Windows color scheme.
    Sys_WindowText, Sys_Window, etc. (Lionel Schaffhauser)
7   Use <C-Tab> to cycle through open windows (e.g., the find dialog).
7   <Esc> should close a dialog.
7   Keep the console for external commands open.  Don't wait for a key to be
    hit.  Re-open it when the user has closed it anyway.  Or use a prepended
    command: ":nowait {cmd}", or ":quiet", which executes {cmd} without any
    prompts.
7   Should be able to set an option so that when you double click a file that
    is associated with Vim, you can either get a new instance of Vim, or have
    the file added into an already running Vim.
7   The "-P" argument only works for the current codepage.  Use wide
    functions to find the window title.


GUI:
8   Make inputdialog() work for Photon, Amiga.
-   <C--> cannot be mapped.  Should be possible to recognize this as a
    normal "-" with the Ctrl modifier.
7   Implement ":popup" for other systems than Windows.
8   Implement ":tearoff" for other systems than Win32 GUI.
6   Implement ":untearoff": hide a torn-off menu.
8   When using the scrollbar to scroll, don't move the cursor position.  When
    moving the cursor: scroll to the cursor position.
9   Make <S-Insert> paste from the clipboard by default. (Kunze)
7   Menu local to a buffer, like mappings.  Or local to a filetype?
8   In Buffers menu, add a choice whether selecting a buffer opens it in the
    current window, splits the window or uses ":hide".
8   Dragging the mouse pointer outside of a Vim Window should make the text
    scroll.  Return a value from gui_send_mouse_event() to the machine
    specific code to indicate the time in which the event should be repeated.
8   Make it possible to ignore a mouse click when it's used to give Vim (gvim)
    window focus.  Also when a mouse click is used to bring a window to front.
8   Make the split into system independent code and system specific code more
    explicit.  There are too many #ifdefs in gui.c.
    If possible, separate the Vim code completely from the GUI code, to allow
    running them in separate processes.
7   X11: Support cursorColor resource and "-cr" argument.
8   X11 (and others): CTRL-; is not different from ';'.  Set the modifier mask
    to include CTRL for keys where CTRL produces the same ASCII code.
7   Add some code to handle proportional fonts on more systems?  Need to draw
    each character separately (like xterm).  Also for when a double-width font
    is not exactly double-width. (Maeda)
8   Should take font from xterm where gvim was started (if no other default).
8   Selecting font names in X11 is difficult, make a script or something to
    select one.
8   Visual highlighting should keep the same font (bold, italic, etc.).
8   Add flag to 'guioptions' to not put anything in the clipboard at all?
8   Should support a way to use keys that we don't recognize yet.  Add a
    command that adds entries to special_keys somehow.	How do we make this
    portable (X11, Win32, ..)?
7   Add a flag to 'guioptions' that tells not to remove inactive menu items.
    For systems where greying-out or removing menu items is very slow.  The
    menu items would remain visibly normally, but not do anything.
7   Add ":minimize" and ":maximize", which iconize the window and back.
    Useful when using gvim to run a script (e.g. 2html.vim).
7   X11: Is it possible to free allocated colors, so that other programs can
    use them again?  Otherwise, allow disabling allocating the default colors.
    Or allocate an own colormap (check UAE).  With an option to use it.  For
    the commandline, "-install" is mostly used for X11 programs.
7   Add command line argument for "gvim" not to start the GUI.  Sort of the
    inverse of "vim -g". (Vikas)
7   Should support multi-column menus.
-   Should add option for where to put the "Help" menu: like Motif at the far
    right, or with the other menus (but still at the right).
-   Add menu item to "Keep Insert mode".
8   ":mkgvimrc" command, that includes menus.
6   Big change: Move GUI to separate program "vimgui", to make startup of vim a
    lot faster, but still be able to do "vim -g" or ":gui".
7   More explicit mouse button binding instead of 'mousemodel'?
7   Add option to set the position of the window on the screen.  'windowpos',
    which has a value of "123,456": <x>,<y>.
    Or add a command, like ":winsize"?
7   Add toolbar for more GUIs.
8   Make it possible to use "amenu icon=BuiltIn##", so that the toolbar item
    name can be chosen free.
7   Make it possible to put the toolbar on top, left, right and/or bottom of
    the window?  Allows for softkey-like use.
6   Separate the part of Vim that does the editing from the part that runs the
    GUI.  Communicate through a pseudo-tty.  Vim starts up, creates a
    pty that is connected to the terminal.  When the GUI starts, the pty is
    reconnected to the GUI process.  When the GUI stops, it is connected to
    the terminal again.  Also use the pty for external processes, it looks
    like a vt100 terminal to them.  Vim uses extra commands to communicate GUI
    things.
7   Motif: For a confirm() dialog <Enter> should be ignored when no default
    button selected, <Esc> should close the dialog.
7   When using a pseudo-tty Vim should behave like some terminal (vt52 looks
    simple enough).  Terminal codes to/from shell should be translated.
-   Would it be useful to be able to quit the GUI and go back to the terminal
    where it was started from?
7   Support "-visual <type>" command line argument.


Autocommands:
9   Rework the code from FEAT_OSFILETYPE for autocmd-osfiletypes to use
    'filetype'.  Only for when the current buffer is known.
-   Put autocommand event names in a hashtable for faster lookup?
8   When the SwapExists event is triggered, provide information about the
    swap file, e.g., whether the process is running, file was modified, etc.
    Must be possible to check the situation that it's probably OK to delete
    the swap file. (Marc Merlin)
8   When all the patterns for an event are "*" there is no need to expand
    buffer names to a full path.  This can be slow for NFS.
7   For autocommand events that trigger multiple times per buffer (e.g.,
    CursorHold), go through the list once and cache the result for a specific
    buffer.  Invalidate the cache when adding/deleting autocommands or
    changing the buffer name.
7   Add TagJump event: do something after jumping to a tag.
8   Add "TagJumpFile" autocommand: When jumping to another file for a tag.
    Can be used to open "main.c.gz" when "main.c" isn't found.
8   Use another option than 'updatetime' for the CursorHold event.  The two
    things are unrelated for the user (but the implementation is more
    difficult).
7   Add autocommand event for when a buffer cannot be abandoned.  So that the
    user can define the action taking (autowrite, dialog, fail) based on the
    kind of file. (Yakov Lerner)  Or is BufLeave sufficient?
8   Autocommand for when modified files have been found, when getting input
    focus again (e.g., FileChangedFocus).
    Check when: getting focus, jumping to another buffer, ...
7   Autocommand for when an option is changed.  Match buffer name or option
    name?
8   Autocommands should not change registers.  And marks?  And the jumplist?
    And anything else?  Add a command to save and restore these things.
8   Add autocommands, user functions and user commands to ":mkvimrc".
6   Add KeymapChanged event, so that the effects of a different keymap can be
    handled (e.g., other font) (Ron Aaron)
7   When trying to open a directory, trigger an OpenDirectory event.
7   Add file type in front of file pattern: <d> for directory, <l> for link,
    <x> for executable, etc.  With commas to separate alternatives.  The
    autocommand is only executed when both the file type AND the file pattern
    match. (Leonard)
5   Add option that specifies extensions which are to be discarded from the
    file name.  E.g. 'ausuffix', with ".gz,.orig".  Such that file.c.gz will
    trigger the "*.c" autocommands.  (Belabas)
7   Add something to break the autocommands for the current event, and for
    what follows.  Useful for a "BufWritePre" that wants to avoid writing the
    file.
8   When editing "tt.gz", which is in DOS format, 'fileformat' stays at
    "unix", thus writing the file changes it.  Somehow detect that the read
    command used dos fileformat.  Same for 'fileencoding'.
-   Add events to autocommands:
    Error	    - When an error happens
    NormalEnter	    - Entering Normal mode
    ReplaceEnter    - Entering Replace mode
    CmdEnter	    - Entering Cmdline mode (with type of cmdline to allow
			different mapping)
    VisualEnter	    - Entering Visual mode
    *Leave	    - Leaving a mode (in pair with the above *Enter)
    VimLeaveCheck    - Before Vim decides to exit, so that it can be cancelled
		      when exiting isn't a good idea.
    CursorHoldC     - CursorHold while command-line editing
    WinMoved	    - when windows have been moved around, e.g, ":wincmd J"
    SearchPost	    - After doing a search command (e.g. to do "M")
    PreDirChanged/PostDirChanged
		    - Before/after ":cd" has been used (for changing the
		      window title)
    ShutDown	    - when the system is about to shut down
    InsertCharPost  - user typed a character in Insert mode, after inserting
		      the char.
    BufModified	    - When a buffer becomes modified, or unmodified (for
		      putting a [+] in the window title or checking out the
		      file from CVS).
    BufFirstChange  - When making a change, when 'modified' is set.  Can be
		      used to do a :preserve for remote files.
    BufChange	    - after a change was made.  Set some variables to indicate
		      the position and number of inserted/deleted lines, so
		      that marks can be updated.  HierAssist has patch to add
		      BufChangePre, BufChangePost and RevertBuf. (Shah)
    ViewChanged	    - triggered when the text scrolls and when the window size
		      changes.
    WinResized	    - After a window has been resized
    WinClose	    - Just before closing a window
-   Write the file now and then ('autosave'):
				  *'autosave'* *'as'* *'noautosave'* *'noas'*
    'autosave' 'as' number  (default 0)
	    Automatically write the current buffer to file N seconds after the
	    last change has been made and when |'modified'| is still set.
	    Default: 0 = do not autosave the buffer.
    Alternative: have 'autosave' use 'updatetime' and 'updatecount' but make
    them save the file itself besides the swapfile.


Omni completion:
-   Add a flag to 'complete' to be able to do omni completion with CTRL-N (and
    mix it with other kinds of completion).
-   Ideas from the Vim 7 BOF at SANE:
	- For interpreted languages, use the interpreter to obtain information.
	  Should work for Java (Eclipse does this), Python, Tcl, etc.
	  Richard Emberson mentioned working on an interface to Java.
	- Check Readline for its completion interface.

-   Pre-expand abbreviations, show which abbrevs would match?


Insert mode completion/expansion:
-   GUI implementation of the popup menu.
7   When searching in other files the name flash by, too fast to read.  Only
    display a name every second or so, like with ":vimgrep".
7   When expanding file names with an environment variable, add the match with
    the unexpanded var.  So $HOME/tm expands to "/home/guy/tmp" and
    "$HOME/tmp"
8   When there is no word before the cursor but something like "sys." complete
    with "sys.".  Works well for C and similar languages.
9   ^X^L completion doesn't repeat correctly.  It uses the first match with
    the last added line, instead of continuing where the last match ended.
    (Webb)
8   Add option to set different behavior for Insert mode completion:
    - ignore/match case
    - different characters than 'iskeyword'
8   Add option 'isexpand', containing characters when doing expansion (so that
    "." and "\" can be included, without changing 'iskeyword'). (Goldfarb)
    Also: 'istagword': characters used for CTRL-].
    When 'isexpand' or 'istagword' are empty, use 'iskeyword'.
    Alternative: Use a pattern so that start and end of a keyword can be
    defined, only allow dash in the middle, etc.
8   Add a command to undo the completion, go back to the original text.
7   Completion of an abbreviation: Can leave letters out, like what Instant
    text does: www.textware.com
8   Use the class information in the tags file to do context-sensitive
    completion.  After "foo." complete all member functions/variables of
    "foo".  Need to search backwards for the class definition of foo.
    Should work for C++ and Java.
    Even more context would be nice: "import java.^N" -> "io", "lang", etc.
7   When expanding $HOME/dir with ^X^F keep the $HOME (with an option?).
7   Add CTRL-X command in Insert mode like CTRL-X CTRL-N, that completes WORDS
    instead of words.
8   Add CTRL-X CTRL-R: complete words from register contents.
8   Add completion of previously inserted texts (like what CTRL-A does).
    Requires remembering a number of insertions.
8   Add 'f' flag to 'complete': Expand file names.
    Also apply 'complete' to whole line completion.
-   Add a flag to 'complete' to only scan local header files, not system
    header files. (Andri Moell)
-   Make it possible to search include files in several places.  Use the
    'path' option?  Can this be done with the dictionary completion (use
    wildcards in the file name)?
-   Make CTRL-X CTRL-K do a binary search in the dictionary (if it's sorted).
-   Speed up CTRL-X CTRL-K dictionary searching (don't use a regexp?).
-   Set a mark at the position where the match was found (file mark, could
    be in another file).
-   Add CTRL-A command in CTRL-X mode: show all matches.
-   Make CTRL-X CTRL-L use the 'complete' option?
-   Add command in CTRL-X mode to add following words to the completed string
    (e.g. to complete "Pointer->element" with CTRL-X CTRL-P CTRL-W CTRL-W)
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Use 'path' to find completions.
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Option to use forward slashes on MS-Windows?
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Don't replace "$VIM" with the actual value. (Kelly)
-   Allow listing all matches in some way (and picking one from the list).


Command line editing:
7   Add commands (keys) to delete from the cursor to the end of the command
    line.
8   Custom completion of user commands can't use the standard completion
    functions.  Add a hook to invoke a user function that returns the type of
    completion to be done: "file", "tag", "custom", etc.
-   Add flags to 'whichwrap' for command line editing (cursor right at end of
    lines wraps to start of line).
-   Make editing the command line work like Insert mode in a single-line view
    on a buffer that contains the command line history.  But this has many
    disadvantages, only implement it when these can be solved.  Elvis has run
    into these, see remarks from Steve (~/Mail/oldmail/kirkendall/in.00012).
    - Going back in history and editing a line there would change the history.
      Would still need to keep a copy of the history elsewhere.  Like the
      cmdwin does now already.
    - Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command.  How to switch to normal
      mode for more commands?  <Esc> should cancel the command line.  CTRL-T?
    - To allow "/" and "= need to recursively call getcmdline(), overwrite the
      cmdline.  But then we are editing a command-line again.  How to avoid
      that the user gets confused by the stack of command lines?
    - Use edit() for normal cmdline editing?  Would have to integrate
      getcmdline() into edit().  Need to solve conflicts between Insert mode
      and Command-line mode commands.  Make it work like Korn shell and tcsh.
      Problems:
	- Insert: completion with 'wildchar'
	- Insert: use cmdline abbreviations
	- Insert: CTRL-D deletes indent instead of listing matches
	- Normal: no CTRL-W commands
	- Normal: no ":" commands?
	- Normal: allow Visual mode only within one line.
    - where to show insert/normal mode message?  Change highlighting of
      character in first column?
    - Implementation ideas:
      - Set "curwin" and "curbuf" to the command line window and buffer.
      - curwin->w_topline is always equal to curwin->w_cursor.lnum.
      - never set 'number', no folding, etc.  No status line.
      - sync undo after entering a command line?
      - use NV_NOCL flag for commands that are not allowed in Command-line
	Mode.


Command line completion:
8   Change expand_interactively into a flag that is passed as an argument.
8   With command line completion after '%' and '#', expand current/alternate
    file name, so it can be edited.  Also with modifiers, such as "%:h".
8   When completing command names, either sort them on the long name, or list
    them with the optional part inside [].
8   Add an option to ignore case when doing interactive completion.  So that
    ":e file<Tab>" also lists "Filelist" (sorted after matching case matches).
7   Completion of ":map x ": fill in the current mapping, so that it can be
    edited. (Sven Guckes)
-   For 'wildmenu': Simplify "../bar" when possible.
-   When using <Up> in wildmenu mode for a submenu, should go back to the
    current menu, not the first one.  E.g., ":emenu File.Save<Up>".
8   When using backtick expansion, the external command may write a greeting
    message.  Add an option or commands to remove lines that match a regexp?
7   When listing matches of files, display the common path separately from the
    file names, if this makes the listing shorter. (Webb)
-   Add command line completion for ":ilist" and friends, show matching
    identifiers (Webb).
8   Add command line completion for "old value" of a command.  ":args <key>"
    would result in the current list of arguments, which you can then edit.
7   Add command line completion with CTRL-X, just like Insert mode completion.
    Useful for ":s/word/xx/".
-   Add command to go back to the text as it was before completion started.
    Also to be used for <Up> in the command line.
-   Add 'wildlongest' option: Key to use to find longest common match for
    command line completion (default CTRL-L), like 'wildchar'. (Cregut)
    Also: when there are several matches, show them line a CTRL-D.


Command line history:
-   Add "KeyWasTyped" flag: It's reset before each command and set when a
    character from the keyboard is consumed. Value is used to decide to put a
    command line in history or not. Put line in history if it didn't
    completely resulted from one mapping.
-   When using ":browse", also put the resulting edit command in the history,
    so that it can be repeated. (Demirel)


Insert mode:
9   When 'autoindent' is set, hitting <CR> twice, while there is text after
    the cursor, doesn't delete the autoindent in the resulting blank line.
    (Rich Wales) This is Vi compatible, but it looks like a bug.
8   When using CTRL-O in Insert mode, then executing an insert command
    "a" or "i", should we return to Insert mode after <Esc>? (Eggink)
    Perhaps it can be allowed a single time, to be able to do
    "<C-O>10axyz<Esc>".  Nesting this further is confusing.
    ":map <F2> 5aabc<Esc>" works only once from Insert mode.
8   When using CTRL-G CTRL-O do like CTRL-\ CTRL-O, but when returning with
    the cursor in the same position and the text didn't change continue the
    same change, so that "." repeats the whole insert.
7   Use CTRL-G <count> to repeat what follows.  Useful for inserting a
    character multiple times or repeating CTRL-Y.
-   Make 'revins' work in Replace mode.
9   Can't use multi-byte characters for 'matchpairs'.
7   Use 'matchpairs' for 'showmatch': When inserting a character check if it
    appears in the rhs of 'matchpairs'.
-   In Insert mode (and command line editing?): Allow undo of the last typed
    character.	This is useful for CTRL-U, CTRL-W, delete and backspace, and
    also for characters that wrap to the next line.
    Also: be able to undo CTRL-R (insert register).
    Possibly use 'backspace'="whole" for a mode where at least a <CR> that
    inserts autoindent is undone by a single <BS>.
-   Use CTRL-G in Insert mode for an extra range of commands, like "g" in
    Normal mode.
-   Make 'paste' work without resetting other options, but override their
    value.  Avoids problems when changing files and modelines or autocommands
    are used.
-   When typing CTRL-V and a digit higher than 2, only expect two digits.
-   Insert binary numbers with CTRL-V b.
-   Make it possible to undo <BS>, <C-W> and <C-U>.  Bash uses CTRL-Y.


'cindent', 'smartindent':
9   Wrapping a variable initialization should have extra indent:
	char * veryLongName =
		"very long string"
    Also check if "cino=+10" is used correctly.
8   Lisp indenting: "\\" confuses the indenter. (Dorai Sitaram, 2006 May 17)
8   Why are continuation lines outside of a {} block not indented?  E.g.:
	long_type foo =
	value;
8   Java: Inside an anonymous class, after an "else" or "try" the indent is
    too small. (Vincent Bergbauer)
    Problem of using {} inside (), 'cindent' doesn't work then.
8   In C++ it's possible to have {} inside (): (Kirshna)
		func(
			new String[] {
			    "asdf",
			    "asdf"
			}
		    );
8   In C++ a function isn't recognized inside a namespace:
    (Chow Loong Jin)
	namespace {
	    int
		 func(int arg) {
		 }
	}
6   Add 'cino' flag for this function argument layout: (Spencer Collyer)
	    func( arg1
	        , arg2
		, arg3
		);
7   Add separate "(0" option into inside/outside a function (Zellner):
	func(
	   int x)	// indent like "(4"
	{
	   if (a
	       && b)	// indent like "(0"
9   Using "{" in a comment: (Helmut Stiegler)
    if (a)
    {
	    if (b)
	    {
		    // {
	    }
	    } <-- this is indented incorrect
    Problem is that find_start_brace() checks for the matching brace to be in
    a comment, but not braces in between.  Requires adding a comment check to
    findmatchlimit().
-   Make smartindenting configurable.  Add 'sioptions', e.g. '#' setting the
    indent to 0 should be switched on/off.
7   Support ANSI style function header, with each argument on its own line.
-   "[p" and "]p" should use 'cindent' code if it's on (only for the first
    line).
-   Add option to 'cindent' to set indent for comments outside of {}?
-   Make a command to line up a comment after a code line with a previous
    comment after a code line.	Can 'cindent' do this automatically?
-   When 'cindent'ing a '}', showmatch is done before fixing the indent.  It
    looks better when the indent is fixed before the showmatch. (Webb)
-   Add option to make indenting work in comments too (for commented-out
    code), unless the line starts with "*".
-   Don't use 'cindent' when doing formatting with "gq"?
-   When formatting a comment after some text, insert the '*' for the new line
    (indent is correct if 'cindent' is set, but '*' doesn't get inserted).
8   When 'comments' has both "s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/" and "s1:(*,mb:*,ex:*)", the
    'x' flag always uses the first match.  Need to continue looking for more
    matches of "*" and remember all characters that could end the comment.
-   For smartindent: When typing 'else' line it up with matching 'if'.
-   'smartindent': allow patterns in 'cinwords', for e.g. TeX files, where
    lines start with "\item".
-   Support this style of comments (with an option): (Brown)
	/* here is a comment that
	is just autoindented, and
	nothing else */
-   Add words to 'cinwords' to reduce the indent, e.g., "end" or "fi".
7   Use Tabs for the indent of starting lines, pad with spaces for
    continuation lines.  Allows changing 'tabstop' without messing up the
    indents.
    Patch by Lech Lorens, 2010 Mar.  Update by James McCoy, 2014 Mar 15.


Java:
8   Can have {} constructs inside parens.  Include changes from Steve
    Odendahl?
8   Recognize "import java.util.Vector" and use $CLASSPATH to find files for
    "[i" commands and friends.
-   For files found with 'include': handle "*" in included name, for Java.
    (Jason)
-   How to make a "package java.util" cause all classes in the package to be
    searched?  Also for "import java.util.*". (Mark Brophy)


'comments':
8   When formatting C comments that are after code, the "*" isn't repeated
    like it's done when there is no code.  And there is no automatic wrapping.
    Recognize comments that come after code.  Should insert the comment leader
    when it's "#" or "//".
    Other way around: when a C command starts with "* 4" the "*" is repeated
    while it should not.  Use syntax HL comment recognition?
7   When using "comments=fg:--", Vim inserts three spaces for a new line.
    When hitting a TAB, these spaces could be removed.
7   The 'n'esting flag doesn't do the indenting of the last (rightmost) item.
6   Make strings in 'comments' option a RE, to be able to match more
    complicated things. (Phillipps)  Use a special flag to indicate that a
    regexp is used.
8   Make the 'comments' option with "/* * */" lines only repeat the "*" line
    when there is a "/*" before it?  Or include this in 'cindent'?


Virtual edit:
8   Make the horizontal scrollbar work to move the text further left.
7   Allow specifying it separately for Tabs and beyond end-of-line?


Text objects:
8   Add text object for fold, so that it can be yanked when it's open.
8   Add test script for text object commands "aw", "iW", etc.
8   Add text object for part of a CamelHumpedWord and under_scored_word.
    (Scott Graham)  "ac" and "au"?
8   Add a text object for any kind of quoting, also with multi-byte
    characters.  Option to specify what quotes are recognized (default: all)
    use "aq" and "iq".  Use 'quotepairs' to define pairs of quotes, like
    'matchpairs'?
8   Add text object for any kind of parens, also multi-byte ones.
7   Add text object for current search pattern: "a/" and "i/".  Makes it
    possible to turn text highlighted for 'hlsearch' into a Visual area.
8   Add a way to make an ":omap" for a user-defined text object.  Requires
    changing the starting position in oap->start.
8   Add "gp" and "gP" commands: insert text and make sure there is a single
    space before it, unless at the start of the line, and after it, unless at
    the end of the line or before a ".".
7   Add objects with backwards extension?  Use "I" and "A".  Thus "2dAs"
    deletes the current and previous sentence. (Jens Paulus)
7   Add "g{" and "g}" to move to the first/last character of a paragraph
    (instead of the line just before/after a paragraph as with "{" and "}").
6   Ignore comment leaders for objects.  Make "das" work in reply-email.
5   Make it possible to use syntax group matches as a text object.  For
    example, define a "ccItem" group, then do "da<ccItem>" to delete one.
    Or, maybe just define "dai", delete-an-item, to delete the syntax item the
    cursor is on.


Select mode:
8   In blockwise mode, typed characters are inserted in front of the block,
    backspace deletes a column before the block. (Steve Hall)
7   Alt-leftmouse starts block mode selection in MS Word.
    See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_Alt-Mouse_to_select_blockwise.
7   Add Cmdline-select mode.  Like Select mode, but used on the command line.
    - Change gui_send_mouse_event() to pass on mouse events when 'mouse'
      contains 'C' or 'A'.
    - Catch mouse events in ex_getln.c.  Also shift-cursor, etc., like in
      normal_cmd().
    - remember start and end of selection in cmdline_info.
    - Typing text replaces the selection.


Visual mode:
8   Support using "." in Visual mode. Use the operator applied to the Visual
    selection, if possible.
-   When dragging the Visual selection with the mouse and 'scrolloff' is zero,
    behave like 'scrolloff' is one, so that the text scrolls when the pointer
    is in the top line.
-   Displaying size of Visual area: use 24-33 column display.
    When selecting multiple lines, up to about a screenful, also count the
    characters.
8   When using "I" or "A" in Visual block mode, short lines do not get the new
    text.  Make it possible to add the text to short lines too, with padding
    where needed.
7   With a Visual block selected, "2x" deletes a block of double the width,
    "3y" yanks a block of triple width, etc.
7   When selecting linewise, using "itext" should insert "text" at the start
    of each selected line.
8   What is "R" supposed to do in Visual mode?
8   Make Visual mode local to the buffer.  Allow changing to another buffer.
    When starting a new Visual selection, remove the Visual selection in any
    other buffer. (Ron Aaron)
8   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it somewhere else. (Ron Aaron,
    Ben Godfrey)
7   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it in another program, and
    receive dropped text from another program. (Ben Godfrey)
7   With blockwise Visual mode and "c", "C", "I", "A", etc., allow the use of
    a <CR>.  The entered lines are repeated over the Visual area.
7   CTRL-V :s should substitute only in the block, not to whole lines. (David
    Young is working on this)
7   Filtering a block should only apply to the block, not to the whole lines.
    When the number of lines is increased, add lines. When decreased, pad with
    spaces or delete? Use ":`<,`>" on the command line.
8   After filtering the Visual area, make "gv" select the filtered text?
    Currently "gv" only selects a single line, not useful.
7   Don't move the cursor when scrolling?  Needed when the selection should
    stay the same.  Scroll to the cursor at any movement command.  With an
    option!
7   In Visual block mode, need to be able to define a corner on a position
    that doesn't have text?  Also: when using the mouse, be able to select
    part of a TAB.  Even more: Add a mode where the cursor can be on a screen
    position where there is no text.  When typing, add spaces to fill the gap.
    Other solution: Always use curswant, so that you can move the cursor to
    the right column, and then use up/down movements to select the line,
    without changing the column.
6   ":left" and ":right" should work in Visual block mode.
7   CTRL-I and CTRL-O should work in Visual mode, but only jump to marks in the
    current buffer.
7   CTRL-A and CTRL-X should increase/decrease all numbers in the Visual area.
6   In non-Block mode, "I" should insert the same text in front of each line,
    before the first non-blank, "gI" in column 1.
6   In non-Block mode, "A" should append the same text after each line.
6   When in blockwise visual selection (CTRL-V), allow cursor to be placed
    right of the line.  Could also allow cursor to be placed anywhere on a TAB
    or other special character.
6   Add commands to move selected text, without deselecting.


More advanced repeating commands:
-   Add "." command for visual mode: redo last visual command (e.g. ":fmt").
7   Repeating "d:{cmd}" with "." doesn't work. (Benji Fisher)  Somehow remember
    the command line so that it can be repeated?
-   Add command to repeat last movement.  Including count.
-   Add "." command after operator: repeat last command of same operator.  E.g.
    "c." will repeat last change, also when "x" used since then (Webb).
    "y." will repeat last yank.
    "c2." will repeat the last but one change?
    Also: keep history of Normal mode commands, add command to list the history
    and/or pick an older command.
-   History stack for . command?  Use "g." command.


Mappings and Abbreviations:
8   When "0" is mapped (it is a movement command) this mapping should not be
    used after typing another number, e.g. "20l". (Charles Campbell)
    Is this possible without disabling the mapping of the following command?
8   Should mapping <C-A> and <C-S-A> both work?
7   ":abbr b byte", append "b " to an existing word still expands to "byte".
    This is Vi compatible, but can we avoid it anyway?
8   To make a mapping work with a prepended "x to select a register, store the
    last _typed_ register name and access it with "&.
8   Add ":amap", like ":amenu".
7   Add a mapping that works always, for remapping the keyboard.
8   Add ":cab!", abbreviations that only apply to Command-line mode and not to
    entering search strings.
8   Add a flag to ":abbrev" to eat the character that triggers the
    abbreviation.  Thus "abb ab xxx" and typing "ab<Space>" inserts "xxx" and
    not the <Space>.
8   Give a warning when using CTRL-C in the lhs of a mapping.  It will never
    (?) work.
8   Add a way to save a current mapping and restore it later.  Use a function
    that returns the mapping command to restore it: mapcmd()?  mapcheck() is
    not fool proof.  How to handle ambiguous mappings?
7   Add <0x8f> (hex), <033> (octal) and <123> (decimal) to <> notation?
7   When someone tries to unmap with a trailing space, and it fails, try
    unmapping without the trailing space.  Helps for ":unmap xx | unmap yy".
6   Context-sensitive abbreviations: Specify syntax group(s) in which the
    abbreviations are to be used.
-   Add mappings that take arguments.  Could work like the ":s" command.  For
    example, for a mouse escape sequence:
	:mapexp  <Esc>{\([0-9]*\),\([0-9]*\);	H\1j\2l
-   Add optional <Number> argument for mappings:
    :map <Number>q	     ^W^W<Number>G
    :map <Number>q<Number>t  ^W^W<Number1-1>G<Number2>l
    :map q<Char>	    :s/<Char>/\u\0/g
    Or implicit:
    :map q			<Register>d<Number>$
-   Add command to repeat a whole mapping ("." only repeats the last change in
    a mapping).  Also: Repeat a whole insert command, including any mappings
    that it included.  Sort-of automatic recording?
-   Include an option (or flag to 'cpoptions') that makes errors in mappings
    not flush the rest of the mapping (like nvi does).
-   Use context sensitiveness of completion to switch abbreviations and
    mappings off for :unab and :unmap.
6   When using mappings in Insert mode, insert characters for incomplete
    mappings first, then remove them again when a mapping matches.  Avoids
    that characters that are the start of some mapping are not shown until you
    hit another character.
-   Add mappings for replace mode: ":rmap".  How do we then enter mappings for
    non-replace Insert mode?
-   Add separate mappings for Visual-character/block/line mode?
-   Add 'mapstop' command, to stop recursive mappings.
-   List mappings that have a raw escape sequence both with the name of the key
    for that escape sequence (if there is one) and the sequence itself.
-   List mappings: Once with special keys listed as <>, once with meta chars as
    <M-a>, once with the byte values (octal?).  Sort of "spell mapping" command?
-   When entering mappings: Add the possibility to enter meta keys like they
    are displayed, within <>: <M-a>, <~@> or <|a>.
-   Allow multiple arguments to :unmap.
-   Command to show keys that are not used and available for mapping
    ":freekeys".
-   Allow any character except white space in abbreviations lhs (Riehm).


Incsearch:
-   Add a limit to the number of lines that are searched for 'incsearch'?
-   When no match is found and the user types more, the screen is redrawn
    anyway.  Could skip that.  Esp. if the line wraps and the text is scrolled
    up every time.
-   Temporarily open folds to show where the search ends up.  Restore the
    folds when going to another line.
-   When incsearch used and hitting return, no need to search again in many
    cases, saves a lot of time in big files. (Slootman wants to work on this?)
    When not using special characters, can continue search from the last match
    (or not at all, when there was no match).  See oldmail/webb/in.872.
-   With incsearch, use CTRL-N/CTRL-P to go to next/previous match, some other
    key to copy matched word to search pattern (Alexander Schmid).


Searching:
9   Should have an option for :vimgrep to find lines without a match.
8   Add "g/" and "gb" to search for a pattern in the Visually selected text?
    "g?" is already used for rot13.
    The vis.vim script has a ":S" command that does something like this.
    Can use "g/" in Normal mode, uses the '< to '> area.
    Use "&/" for searching the text in the Visual area?
9   Add "v" offset: "/pat/v": search for pattern and start Visual mode on the
    matching text.
8   Add a modifier to interpret a space like "\_s\+" to make it much easier to
    search for a phrase.
8   Add a mechanism for recursiveness: "\@(([^()]*\@g[^()]*)\)".  \@g stands
    for "go recursive here" and \@( \) marks the recursive part.
    Perl does it this way:
	    $paren = qr/ \(( [^()] | (??{ $paren }) )* \) /x;
    Here $paren is evaluated when it's encountered.  This is like a regexp
    inside a regexp.  In the above terms it would be:
	    \@((\([^()]\|\@g\)*)\)
8   Show the progress every second.  Could use the code that checks for CTRL-C
    to find out how much time has passed.  Or use SIGALRM.  Where to show the
    number?
8   When using an expression for ":s", set the match position in a v:
    variable.  So that you can do ":%s/^/\=v:lnum/" to put a line number
    before each line.
7   Support for approximate-regexps to find similar words (agrep
    http://www.tgries.de/agrep/ tre: http://laurikari.net/tre/index.html).
8   Add an item for a big character range, so that one can search for a
    chinese character: \z[234-1234]  or \z[XX-YY] or \z[0x23-0x234].
7   Add an item stack to allow matching ().  One side is "push X on
    the stack if previous atom matched".  Other side is "match with top of
    stack, pop it when it matches".  Use "\@pX" and "\@m"?
	Example: \((\@p).\{-}\@m\)*
7   Add an option to accept a match at the cursor position.  Also for
    search(). (Brett)
7   Add a flag to "/pat/" to discard an error.  Useful to continue a mapping
    when a search fails.  Could be "/pat/E" (e is already used for end offset).
7   Add pattern item to use properties of Unicode characters.  In Perl it's
    "\p{L}" for a letter.  See Regular Expression Pocket Reference.
8   Would it be possible to allow ":23,45/pat/flags" to search for "pat" in
    lines 23 to 45?  Or does this conflict with Ex range syntax?
8   Allow identical pairs in 'matchpairs'.  Restrict the search to the current
    line.
7   Allow longer pairs in 'matchpairs'.  Use ~/vim/macros/matchit.vim as an
    example.
8   Make it possible to define the character that "%" checks for in
    #if/#endif.  For nmake it's !if/!endif.
-   For "%" command: set hierarchy for which things include other things that
    should be ignored (like "*/" or "#endif" inside /* */).
    Also: use "%" to jump from start to end of syntax region and back.
    Alternative: use matchit.vim
8   "/:/e+1" gets stuck on a match at the end of the line.  Do we care?
8   A pattern like "\([^a]\+\)\+" takes an awful long time.  Recognize that
    the recursive "\+" is meaningless and optimize for it.
    This one is also very slow on "/* some comment */": "^\/\*\(.*[^/]\)*$".
7   Recognize "[a-z]", "[0-9]", etc. and replace them with the faster "\l" and
    "\d".
7   Add a way to specify characters in <C-M> or <Key> form.  Could be
    \%<C-M>.
8   Add an argument after ":s/pat/str/" for a range of matches.  For example,
    ":s/pat/str/#3-4" to replace only the third and fourth "pat" in a line.
8   When 'iskeyword' is changed the matches from 'hlsearch' may change. (Benji
    Fisher)  redraw if some options are set while 'hlsearch' is set?
8   Add an option not to use 'hlsearch' highlighting for ":s" and ":g"
    commands. (Kahn)  It would work like ":noh" is used after that command.
    Also: An extra flag to do this once, and a flag to keep the existing
    search pattern.
-   Make 'hlsearch' a local/global option, so that it can be disabled in some
    of the windows.
-   Add \%h{group-name}; to search for a specific highlight group.
    Add \%s{syntax-group}; to search for a specific syntax group.
-   Support Perl regexp.  Use PCRE (Perl Compatible RE) package. (Shade)
    Or translate the pattern to a Vim one.
    Don't switch on with an option for typed commands/mappings/functions, it's
    too confusing.  Use "\@@" in the pattern, to avoid incompatibilities.
8   Add a way to access the last substitute text, what is used for ":s//~/".
    Can't use the ~ register, it's already used for drag & drop.
-   Remember flags for backreferenced items, so that "*" can be used after it.
    Check with "\(\S\)\1\{3}". (Hemmerling)
8   Flags that apply to the whole pattern.
    This works for all places where a regexp is used.
    Add "\q" to not store this pattern as the last search pattern?
-   Add flags to search command (also for ":s"?):
    i	ignore case
    I	use case
    p	use Perl regexp syntax (or POSIX?)
    v	use Vi regexp syntax
    f	forget pattern, don't keep it for "n" command
    F   remember pattern, keep it for "n" command
    Perl uses these too:
    e	evaluate the right side as an expression (Perl only)
    m	multiple line expression (we don't need it)
    o	compile only once (Perl only)
    s	single line expression (we don't need it)
    x	extended regexp (we don't need it)
    When used after ":g" command, backslash needed to avoid confusion with the
    following command.
    Add 'searchflags' for default flags (replaces 'gdefault').
-   Add command to display the last used substitute pattern and last used
    pattern. (Margo)  Maybe make it accessible through a register (like "/
    for search string)?
7   Use T-search algorithm, to speed up searching for strings without special
    characters.  See C't article, August 1997.
-   Add 'fuzzycase' option, so that case doesn't matter, and '-' and '_' are
    equivalent (for Unix filenames).
-   Add 'v' flag to search command: enter Visual mode, with the matching text
    as Visual area. (variation on idea from Bertin)
-   Searching: "/this//that/" should find "that" after "this".
-   Add global search commands: Instead of wrapping at the end of the buffer,
    they continue in another buffer.  Use flag after search pattern:
    a	for the next file in the argument list
    f	for file in the buffer list
    w	for file edited in a window.
    e.g. "/pat/f".  Then "n" and "N" work through files too.  "f" flag also for
    ":s/pat/foo/f"???  Then when 'autowrite' and 'hidden' are both not set, ask
    before saving files: "Save modified buffer "/path/file"? (Yes/Hide/No
    Save-all/hide-All/Quit) ".
-   ":s/pat/foo/3": find 3rd match of "pat", like sed. (Thomas Koehler)
7   When searching with 'n' give message when getting back where the search
    first started.  Remember start of search in '/ mark.
7   Add option that scrolls screen to put cursor in middle of screen after
    search always/when off-screen/never.  And after a ":tag" command.  Maybe
    specify how many lines below the screen causes a redraw with the cursor in
    the middle (default would be half a screen, zero means always).
6   Support multiple search buffers, so macros can be made without side
    effects.
7   From xvim: Allow a newline in search patterns (also for :s, can delete
    newline).  Add BOW, EOW, NEWL, NLORANY, NLBUTANY, magic 'n' and 'r', etc.
    [not in xvim:] Add option to switch on matches crossing ONE line boundary.
7   Add ":iselect", a combination of ":ilist" and ":tselect". (Aaron) (Zellner)
    Also ":dselect".


Undo:
9   ":gundo" command: global undo.  Undoes changes spread over multiple files
    in the order they were made.  Also ":gredo".  Both with a count.  Useful
    when tests fail after making changes and you forgot in which files.
9   After undo/redo, in the message show whether the buffer is modified or
    not.
8   Use timestamps for undo, so that a version a certain time ago can be found
    and info before some time/date can be flushed. 'undopersist' gives maximum
    time to keep undo: "3h", "1d", "2w", "1y", etc.
8   Search for pattern in undo tree, showing when it happened and the text
    state, so that you can jump to it.
8   Undo tree: visually show the tree somehow (Damian Conway)
    Show only the leaves, indicating how many changed from the branch and the
    timestamp?
    Put branch with most recent change on the left, older changes get more
    indent?
8   See ":e" as a change operation, find the changes and add them to the
    undo info.  Also be able to undo the "Reload file" choice for when a file
    was changed outside of Vim.
    Would require doing a diff between the buffer text and the file and
    storing the differences.
    Alternative: before reloading a buffer, store it somewhere.  Keep a list
    of about 10 last reloaded buffers.
-   Make it possible to undo all the commands from a mapping, including a
    trailing unfinished command, e.g. for ":map K iX^[r".
-   When accidentally hitting "R" instead of Ctrl-R, further Ctrl-R is not
    possible, even when typing <Esc> immediately. (Grahn)  Also for "i", "a",
    etc.  Postpone saving for undo until something is really inserted?
8   When Inserting a lot of text, it can only be undone as a whole.  Make undo
    sync points at every line or word.  Could recognize the start of a new
    word (white space and then non-white space) and backspacing.
    Can already use CTRL-G u, but that requires remapping a lot of things.
8   Make undo more memory-efficient: Compare text before and after change,
    only remember the lines that really changed.
7   Add undo for a range of lines.  Can change these back to a previous
    version without changing the rest of the file.  Stop doing this when a
    change includes only some of these lines and changes the line count.  Need
    to store these undo actions as a separate change that can be undone.
-   For u_save() include the column number. This can be used to set '[ and '].
    And in the future the undo can be made more efficient (Webb).
-   In out-of-memory situations: Free allocated space in undo, and reduce the
    number of undo levels (with confirmation).
-   Instead of [+], give the number of changes since the last write: [+123].
    When undoing to before the last write, change this to a negative number:
    [-99].
-   With undo with simple line delete/insert: optimize screen updating.
-   When executing macro's: Save each line for undo only once.
-   When doing a global substitute, causing almost all lines to be changed,
    undo info becomes very big.  Put undo info in swap file??


Buffer list:
7   Command to execute a command in another buffer: ":inbuf {bufname} {cmd}".
    Also for other windows: ":inwin {winnr} {cmd}".  How to make sure that
    this works properly for all commands, and still be able to return to the
    current buffer/window?  E.g.: ":inbuf xxx only".
8   Add File.{recent_files} menu entries: Recently edited files.
    Ron Aaron has a plugin for this: mru.vim.
8   Unix: Check all uses of fnamecmp() and fnamencmp() if they should check
    inode too.
7   Add another number for a buffer, which is visible for the user.  When
    creating a new buffer, use the lowest number not in use (or the highest
    number in use plus one?).
7   Offer some buffer selection from the command line?  Like using ":ls" and
    asking for a buffer number. (Zachmann)
-   When starting to edit a file that is already in the buffer list, use the
    file name argument for the new short file name. (Webb)
-   Add an option to make ":bnext" and ":bprev" wrap around the end of the
    buffer list.  Also for ":next" and ":prev"?
7   Add argument to ":ls" which is a pattern for buffers to list.
    E.g. ":ls *.c". (Thompson)
7   Add expansion of buffer names, so that "*.c" is expanded to all buffer
    names.  Needed for ":bdel *.c", ":bunload *.c", etc.
8   Support for <afile> where a buffer name is expected.
8   Some commands don't use line numbers, but buffer numbers.  '$'
    should then mean the number of the last buffer.  E.g.: "4,$bdel".
7   Add an option to mostly use slashes in file names.  Separately for
    internal use and for when executing an external program?
8   Some file systems are case-sensitive, some are not.  Besides
    'wildignorecase' there might be more parts inside
    CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAME that are useful on Unix.


Swap (.swp) files:
8   If writing to the swap file fails, should try to open one in another
    directory from 'dir'.  Useful in case the file system is full and when
    there are short file name problems.
8   Also use the code to try using a short file name for the backup and swap
    file for the Win32 and Dos 32 bit versions.
8   When a file is edited by root, add $LOGNAME to know who did su.
8   When the edited file is a symlink, try to put the swap file in the same
    dir as the actual file.  Adjust FullName().  Avoids editing the same file
    twice (e.g. when using quickfix).  Also try to make the name of the backup
    file the same as the actual file?
    Use the code for resolve()?
7   When using 64 bit inode numbers, also store the top 32 bits.  Add another
    field for this, using part of bo_fname[], to keep it compatible.
7   When editing a file on removable media, should put swap file somewhere
    else.  Use something like 'r' flag in 'viminfo'.  'diravoid'?
    Also: Be able to specify minimum disk space, skip directory when not
    enough room.
7   Add a configure check for which directory should be used: /tmp, /var/tmp
    or /var/preserve.
-   Add an option to create a swap file only when making the first change to
    the buffer.  (Liang)  Or only when the buffer is not read-only.
-   Add option to set "umask" for backup files and swap files (Antwerpen).
    'backupumask' and 'swapumask'?  Or 'umaskback' and 'umaskswap'?
-   When editing a readonly file, don't use a swap file but read parts from the
    original file.  Also do this when the file is huge (>'maxmem').  We do
    need to load the file once to count the number of lines?  Perhaps keep a
    cached list of which line is where.


Viminfo:
7   Can probably remove the code that checks for a writable viminfo file,
    because we now do the chown() for root, and others can't overwrite someone
    else's viminfo file.
8   When there is no .viminfo file and someone does "su", runs Vim, a
    root-owned .viminfo file is created.  Is there a good way to avoid this?
    Perhaps check the owner of the directory.  Only when root?
8   Add argument to keep the list of buffers when Vim is started with a file
    name. (Schild)
8   Keep the last used directory of the file browser (File/Open menu).
8   Remember the last used register for "@@".
8   Remember the redo buffer, so that "." works after restarting.
8   Remember a list of last accessed files.  To be used in the
    "File.Open Recent" menu.  Default is to remember 10 files or so.
    Also remember which files have been read and written.  How to display
    this?
7   Also store the ". register (last inserted text).
7   Make it possible to store buffer names in viminfo file relative to some
    directory, to make them portable over a network. (Aaron)
6   Store a snapshot of the currently opened windows.  So that when quitting
    Vim, and then starting again (without a file name argument), you see the
    same files in the windows.  Use ":mksession" code?
-   Make marks present in .viminfo usable as file marks: Display a list of
    "last visited files" and select one to jump to.


Modelines:
8   Before trying to execute a modeline, check that it looks like one (valid
    option names).  If it's very wrong, silently ignore it.
    Ignore a line that starts with "Subject: ".
-   Add an option to whitelist options that are allowed in a modeline.  This
    would allow careful users to use modelines, e.g., only allowing
    'shiftwidth'.
-   Add an option to let modelines only set local options, not global ones
    such as 'encoding'.
-   When an option value is coming from a modeline, do not carry it over to
    another edited file?  Would need to remember the value from before the
    modeline setting.
-   Allow setting a variable from a modeline?  Only allow using fixed strings,
    no function calls, to avoid a security problem.
-   Allow ":doauto BufRead x.cpp" in modelines, to execute autocommands for
    .cpp files.
-   Support the "abbreviate" command in modelines (Kearns).  Careful for
    characters after <Esc>, that is a security leak.
-   Add option setting to ask user if he wants to have the modelines executed
    or not.  Same for .exrc in local dir.


Sessions:
8   DOS/Windows: ":mksession" generates a "cd" command where "aa\#bb" means
    directory "#bb" in "aa", but it's used as "aa#bb". (Ronald Hoellwarth)
7   When there is a "help.txt" window in a session file, restoring that
    session will not get the "LOCAL ADDITIONS" back.
8   With ":mksession" always store the 'sessionoptions' option, even when
    "options" isn't in it. (St-Amant)
8   When using ":mksession", also store a command to reset all options to
    their default value, before setting the options that are not at their
    default value.
7   With ":mksession" also store the tag stack and jump history. (Michal
    Malecki)
7   Persistent variables: "p:var"; stored in viminfo file and sessions files.


Options:
7   ":with option=value | command": temporarily set an option value and
    restore it after the command has executed.
8   Make "old" number options that really give a number of effects into string
    options that are a comma separated list.  The old number values should
    also be supported.
8   Add commands to save and restore an option, which also preserves the flag
    that marks if the option was set.  Useful to keep the effect of setting
    'compatible' after ":syntax on" has been used.
7   There is 'titleold', why is there no 'iconold'? (Chazelas)
7   Make 'scrolloff' a global-local option, so that it can be different in the
    quickfix window, for example. (Gary Holloway)
    Also do 'sidescrolloff'.


External commands:
8   When filtering text, redirect stderr so that it can't mess up the screen
    and Vim doesn't need to redraw it.  Also for ":r !cmd".
4   Set separate shell for ":sh", piping "range!filter", reading text "r !ls"
    and writing text "w !wc". (Deutsche)  Allow arguments for fast start (e.g.
    -f).
4   Allow direct execution, without using a shell.
4   Run an external command in the background.  But how about I/O in the GUI?
    Careful: don't turn Vim into a shell!
4   Add feature to disable using a shell or external commands.


Multiple Windows:
7   "vim -oO file ..." use both horizontal and vertical splits.
8   Add CTRL-W T: go to the top window in the column of the current window.
    And CTRL-W B: go to bottom window.
7   Use CTRL-W <Tab>, like alt-tab, to switch between buffers.  Repeat <Tab>
    to select another buffer (only loaded ones?), <BS> to go back, <Enter> to
    select buffer, <Esc> to go back to original buffer.
7   Make it possible to edit a new buffer in the preview window.  A script can
    then fill it with something.  ":popen"?
7   Add a 'tool' window: behaves like a preview window but there can be
    several.  Don't count it in only_one_window(). (Alexei Alexandrov)
6   Add an option to resize the shell when splitting and/or closing a window.
    ":vsp" would make the shell wider by as many columns as needed for the new
    window.  Specify a maximum size (or use the screen size).  ":close" would
    shrink the shell by as many columns as come available. (Demirel)
7   When starting Vim several times, instantiate a Vim server, that allows
    communication between the different Vims.  Feels like one Vim running with
    multiple top-level windows.  Esp. useful when Vim is started from an IDE
    too.  Requires some form of inter process communication.
-   Support a connection to an external viewer.  Could call the viewer
    automatically after some seconds of non-activity, or with a command.
    Allow some way of reporting scrolling and cursor positioning in the viewer
    to Vim, so that the link between the viewed and edited text can be made.


Marks:
8   Add ten marks for last changed files: ':0, ':1, etc.  One mark per file.
8   When cursor is first moved because of scrolling, set a mark at this
    position.  (Rimon Barr)  Use '-.
8   Add a command to jump to a mark and make the motion inclusive.  g'm and g`m?
8   The '" mark is set to the first line, even when doing ":next" a few times.
    Only set the '" mark when the cursor was really moved in a file.
8   Make `` and '', which would position the new cursor position in the middle
    of the window, restore the old topline (or relative position) from when
    the mark was set.
7   Make a list of file marks in a separate window.  For listing all buffers,
    matching tags, errors, etc.  Normal commands to move around.  Add commands
    to jump to the mark (in current window or new window).  Start it with
    ":browse marks"?
6   Add a menu that lists the Marks like ":marks". (Amerige)
7   For ":jumps", ":tags" and ":marks", for not loaded buffers, remember the
    text at the mark.  Highlight the column with the mark.
7   Highlight each mark in some way (With "Mark" highlight group).
    Or display marks in a separate column, like 'number' does.
7   Use d"m to delete rectangular area from cursor to mark m (like Vile's \m
    command).
7   Try to keep marks in the same position when:
    - replacing with a line break, like in ":s/pat/^M/", move marks after the
      line break column to the next line. (Acevedo)
    - inserting/deleting characters in a line.
5   Include marks for start/end of the current word and section.  Useful in
    mappings.
6   Add "unnamed mark" feature: Like marks for the ":g" command, but place and
    unplace them with commands before doing something with the lines.
    Highlight the marked lines somehow.


Digraphs:
7   Make "ga" show the keymap for a character, if it exists.
    Also show the code of the character after conversion to 'fileencoding'.
-   Use digraph table to tell Vim about the collating sequence of special
    characters?
8   Add command to remove one or more (all) digraphs. (Brown)
7   Support different sets of digraphs (depending on the character set?).  At
    least Latin1/Unicode, Latin-2, MS-DOS (esp. for Win32).


Writing files:
-   In vim_rename(), should lock "from" file when deleting "to" file for
    systems other than Amiga.  Avoids problems with unexpected longname to
    shortname conversion.
8   write mch_isdevice() for Amiga, Mac, VMS, etc.
8   When appending to a file, Vim should also make a backup and a 'patchmode'
    file.
8   'backupskip' doesn't write a backup file at all, a bit dangerous for some
    applications.  Add 'backupelsewhere' to write a backup file in another
    directory?  Or add a flag to 'backupdir'?
6   Add an option to write a new, numbered, backup file each time.  Like
    'patchmode', e.g., 'backupmode'.
6   Make it possible to write 'patchmode' files to a different directory.
    E.g., ":set patchmode=~/backups/*.orig". (Thomas)
6   Add an option to prepend something to the backup file name.  E.g., "#".
    Or maybe allow a function to modify the backup file name?
8   Only make a backup when overwriting a file for the first time.  Avoids
    losing the original when writing twice. (Slootman)
7   On non-Unix machines, also overwrite the original file in some situations
    (file system full, it's a link on an NFS partition).
7   When editing a file, check that it has been change outside of Vim more
    often, not only when writing over it.  E.g., at the time the swap file is
    flushed.  Or every ten seconds or so (use the time of day, check it before
    waiting for a character to be typed).
8   When a file was changed since editing started, show this in the status
    line of the window, like "[time]".
    Make it easier to reload all outdated files that don't have changes.
    Automatic and/or with a command.


Substitute:
8   Substitute with hex/unicode number "\%xff" and "\%uabcd".  Just like
    "\%uabcd" in search pattern.
8   Make it easier to replace in all files in the argument list.  E.g.:
    ":argsub/oldword/newword/".  Works like ":argdo %s/oldword/newword/g|w".
-   :s///p prints the line after a substitution.
-   With :s///c replace \&, ~, etc. when showing the replacement pattern.
8   With :s///c allow scrolling horizontally when 'nowrap' is effective.
    Also allow a count before the scrolling keys.
-   Add number option to ":s//2": replace second occurrence of string?  Or:
    :s///N substitutes N times.
-   Add answers to ":substitute" with 'c' flag, used in a ":global", e.g.:
    ":g/pat1/s/pat2/pat3/cg": 'A' do all remaining replacements, 'Q' don't do
    any replacements, 'u' undo last substitution.
7   Substitute in a block of text.  Use {line}.{column} notation in an Ex
    range, e.g.: ":1.3,$.5s" means to substitute from line 1 column 3 to the
    last line column 5.
5   Add commands to bookmark lines, display bookmarks, remove bookmarks,
    operate on lines with bookmarks, etc.  Like ":global" but with the
    possibility to keep the bookmarks and use them with several commands.
    (Stanislav Sitar)


Mouse support:
8   Add 'o' flag to 'mouse'?
7   Be able to set a 'mouseshape' for the popup menu.
8   Add 'mouse' flag, which sets a behavior like Visual mode, but automatic
    yanking at the button-up event.  Or like Select mode, but typing gets you
    out of Select mode, instead of replacing the text. (Bhaskar)
-   Implement mouse support for the Amiga console.
-   Using right mouse button to extend a blockwise selection should attach to
    the nearest corner of the rectangle (four possible corners).
-   Precede mouse click by a number to simulate double clicks?!?
-   When mouse click after 'r' command, get character that was pointed to.


Argument list:
6   Add command to put all filenames from the tag files in the argument list.
    When given an argument, only use the files where that argument matches
    (like `grep -l ident`) and jump to the first match.
6   Add command to form an args list from all the buffers?


Registers:
8   Don't display empty registers with ":display". (Etienne)
8   Make the # register writable, so that it can be restored after jumping
    around in windows.
8   Add put command that overwrites existing text.  Should also work for
    blocks.  Useful to move text around in a table.  Works like using "R ^R r"
    for every line.
6   When yanking into the unnamed registers several times, somehow make the
    previous contents also available (like it's done for deleting).  What
    register names to use?  g"1, g"2, etc.?
-   When appending to a register, also report the total resulting number of
    lines.  Or just say "99 more lines yanked", add the "more".
-   When inserting a register in Insert mode with CTRL-R, don't insert comment
    leader when line wraps?
-   The ":@r" commands should take a range and execute the register for each
    line in the range.
-   Add "P" command to insert contents of unnamed register, move selected text
	to position of previous deleted (to swap foo and bar in " + foo")
8   Should be able to yank and delete into the "/ register.
    How to take care of the flags (offset, magic)?


Debug mode:
7   Add something to enable debugging when a remote message is received.
8   Add breakpoints for setting an option
8   Add breakpoints for assigning to a variable.
7   Add a watchpoint in the debug mode: An expression that breaks execution
    when evaluating to non-zero.  Add the "watchadd expr" command, stop when
    the value of the expression changes.  ":watchdel" deletes an item,
    ":watchlist" lists the items. (Charles Campbell)
7   Store the history from debug mode in viminfo.
7   Make the debug mode history available with histget() et al.


Various improvements:
7   Add plugins for formatting?  Should be able to make a choice depending on
    the language of a file (English/Korean/Japanese/etc.).
    Setting the 'langformat' option to "chinese" would load the
    "format/chinese.vim" plugin.
    The plugin would set 'formatexpr' and define the function being called.
    Edward L. Fox explains how it should be done for most Asian languages.
    (2005 Nov 24)
    Alternative: patch for utf-8 line breaking. (Yongwei Wu, 2008 Feb 23)
7   [t to move to previous xml/html tag (like "vatov"), ]t to move to next
    ("vatv").
7   [< to move to previous xml/html tag, e.g., previous <li>. ]< to move to
    next <li>, ]< to next </li>, [< to previous </li>.
8   Add ":rename" command: rename the file of the current buffer and rename
    the buffer.  Buffer may be modified.
7   Instead of filtering errors with a shell script it should be possible to
    do this with Vim script.  A function that filters the raw text that comes
    from the 'makeprg'?
-   Add %b to 'errorformat': buffer number. (Yegappan Lakshmanan / Suresh
    Govindachar)
7   Add a command that goes back to the position from before jumping to the
    first quickfix location.  ":cbefore"?
7   Allow a window not to have a statusline.  Makes it possible to use a
    window as a buffer-tab selection.
8   Allow non-active windows to have a different statusline. (Yakov Lerner)
7   Support using ":vert" with User commands.  Add expandable items <vert>.
    Do the same for ":browse" and ":confirm"?
    For ":silent" and ":debug" apply to the whole user command.
    More general: need a way to access command modifiers in a user command.
    Assign them to a v: variable?
7   Add an invisible buffer which can be edited.  For use in scripts that want
    to manipulate text without changing the window layout.
8   Add a command to revert to the saved version of file; undo or redo until
    all changes are gone.
6   "vim -q -" should read the list of errors from stdin. (Gautam Mudunuri)
8   Add "--remote-fail": When contacting the server fails, exit Vim.
    Add "--remote-self": When contacting the server fails, do it in this Vim.
    Overrules the default of "--remote-send" to fail and "--remote" to do it
    in this Vim.
8   When Vim was started without a server, make it possible to start one, as
    if the "--servername" argument was given.  ":startserver <name>"?
8   No address range can be used before the command modifiers.  This makes
    them difficult to use in a menu for Visual mode.  Accept the range and
    have it apply to the following command.
8   Add the possibility to set 'fileformats' to force a format and strip other
    CR characters.  For example, for "dos" files remove CR characters at the
    end of the line, so that a file with mixed line endings is cleaned up.
    To just not display the CR characters: Add a flag to 'display'?
7   Some compilers give error messages in which the file name does not have a
    path.  Be able to specify that 'path' is used for these files.
7   Xterm sends <Esc>O3F for <M-End>.  Similarly for other <M-Home>, <M-Left>,
    etc.  Combinations of Alt, Ctrl and Shift are also possible.  Recognize
    these to avoid inserting the raw byte sequence, handle like the key
    without modifier (unless mapped).
6   Add "gG": like what "gj" is to "j": go to the N'th window line.
8   Add command like ":normal" that accepts <Key> notation like ":map".
9   Support ACLs on more systems.
7   Add ModeMsgVisual, ModeMsgInsert, etc. so that each mode message can be
    highlighted differently.
7   Add a message area for the user.  Set some option to reserve space (above
    the command line?).  Use an ":echouser" command to display the message
    (truncated to fit in the space).
7   Add %s to 'keywordprg': replace with word under the cursor. (Zellner)
8   Support printing on Unix.  Can use "lpansi.c" as an example. (Bookout)
8   Add put command that replaces the text under it.  Esp. for blockwise
    Visual mode.
7   Enhance termresponse stuff: Add t_CV(?): pattern of term response, use
    regexp: "\e\[[>?][0-9;]*c", but only check just after sending t_RV.
7   Add "g|" command: move to N'th column from the left margin (after wrapping
    and applying 'leftcol').  Works as "|" like what "g0" is to "0".
7   Support setting 'equalprg' to a user function name.
7   Highlight the characters after the end-of-line differently.
7   When 'whichwrap' contains "l", "$dl" should join lines?
8   Add an argument to configure to use $CFLAGS and not modify it? (Mooney)
8   Enabling features is a mix of configure arguments and defines in
    feature.h.  How to make this consistent?  Feature.h is required for
    non-unix systems.  Perhaps let configure define CONF_XXX, and use #ifdef
    CONF_XXX in feature.h?  Then what should min-features and max-features do?
8   Add "g^E" and "g^Y", to scroll a screen-full line up and down.
6   Add ":timer" command, to set a command to be executed at a certain
    interval, or once after some time has elapsed. (Aaron)
    Perhaps an autocommand event like CursorHold is better?
    Patch to add async functionality. (Geoff Greer, 2013 Sep 1 and later)
8   Add ":confirm" handling in open_exfile(), for when file already exists.
8   When quitting with changed files, make the dialog list the changed file
    and allow "write all", "discard all", "write some".  The last one would
    then ask "write" or "discard" for each changed file.  Patch in HierAssist
    does something like this. (Shah)
7   Use growarray for replace stack.
7   Have a look at viH (Hellenic or Greek version of Vim).  But a solution
    outside of Vim might be satisfactory (Haritsis).
3   Make "2d%" work like "d%d%" instead of "d2%"?
7   "g CTRL-O" jumps back to last used buffer.	Skip CTRL-O jumps in the same
    buffer.  Make jumplist remember the last ten accessed buffers?
7   Make it possible to set the size of the jumplist (also to a smaller number
    than the default). (Nikolai Weibull)
-   Add code to disable the CAPS key when going from Insert to Normal mode.
-   Set date/protection/etc. of the patchfile the same as the original file.
-   Use growarray for termcodes[] in term.c
-   Add <window-99>, like <cword> but use filename of 99'th window.
7   Add a way to change an operator to always work characterwise-inclusive
    (like "v" makes the operator characterwise-exclusive).  "x" could be used.
-   Make a set of operations on list of names: expand wildcards, replace home
    dir, append a string, delete a string, etc.
-   Remove using mktemp() and use tmpname() only?  Ctags does this.
-   When replacing environment variables, and there is one that is not set,
    turn it into an empty string?  Only when expanding options? (Hiebert)
-   Option to set command to be executed instead of producing a beep (e.g. to
    call "play newbeep.au").
-   Add option to show the current function name in the status line.  More or
    less what you find with "[[k", like how 'cindent' recognizes a function.
    (Bhatt).
-   "[r" and "]r": like "p" and "P", but replace instead of insert (esp. for
    blockwise registers).
-   Add 'timecheck' option, on by default.  Makes it possible to switch off the
    timestamp warning and question. (Dodt).
-   Add an option to set the time after which Vim should check the timestamps
    of the files.  Only check when an event occurs (e.g., character typed,
    mouse moved).  Useful for non-GUI versions where keyboard focus isn't
    noticeable.
-   Make 'smartcase' work even though 'ic' isn't set (Webb).
7   When formatting text, allow to break the line at a number of characters.
    Use an option for this: 'breakchars'?  Useful for formatting Fortran code.
-   Add flag to 'formatoptions' to be able to format book-style paragraphs
    (first line of paragraph has larger indent, no empty lines between
    paragraphs).  Complements the '2' flag.  Use '>' flag when larger indent
    starts a new paragraph, use '<' flag when smaller indent starts a new
    paragraph.	Both start a new paragraph on any indent change.
8   The 'a' flag in 'formatoptions' is too dangerous.  In some way only do
    auto-formatting in specific regions, e.g. defined by syntax highlighting.
8   Allow using a trailing space to signal a paragraph that continues on the
    next line (MIME text/plain; format=flowed, RFC 2646).  Can be used for
    continuous formatting.  Could use 'autoformat' option, which specifies a
    regexp which triggers auto-formatting (for one line).
    ":set autoformat=\\s$".
-   Be able to redefine where a sentence stops.  Use a regexp pattern?
-   Support multi-byte characters for sentences.  Example from Ben Peterson.
7   Add command "g)" to go to the end of a sentence, "g(" to go back to the
    end of a sentence. (Servatius Brandt)
-   Be able to redefine where a paragraph starts.  For "[[" where the '{' is
    not in column 1.
6   Add ":cdprev": go back to the previous directory.  Need to remember a
    stack of previous directories.  We also need ":cdnext".
7   Should ":cd" for MS-DOS go to $HOME, when it's defined?
-   Make "gq<CR>" work on the last line in the file.  Maybe for every operator?
-   Add more redirecting of Ex commands:
	:redir #>  bufname
	:redir #>> bufname   (append)
-   Give error message when starting :redir: twice or using END when no
    redirection was active.
-   Setting of options, specifically for a buffer or window, with
    ":set window.option" or ":set buffer.option=val".  Or use ":buffer.set".
    Also: "buffer.map <F1> quit".
6   Would it be possible to change the color of the cursor in the Win32
    console?  (Klaus Hast)
-   Add :delcr command:
			    *:delcr*
     :[range]delcr[!]	Check [range] lines (default: whole buffer) for lines
			ending in <CR>.  If all lines end in <CR>, or [!] is
			used, remove the <CR> at the end of lines in [range].
			A CTRL-Z at the end of the file is removed.  If
			[range] is omitted, or it is the whole file, and all
			lines end in <CR> 'textmode' is set.  {not in Vi}
-   Should integrate addstar() and file_pat_to_reg_pat().
-   When working over a serial line with 7 bit characters, remove meta
    characters from 'isprint'.
-   Use fchdir() in init_homedir(), like in FullName().
-   In win_update(), when the GUI is active, always use the scrolling area.
    Avoid that the last status line is deleted and needs to be redrawn.
-   That "cTx" fails when the cursor is just after 'x' is Vi compatible, but
    may not be what you expect.  Add a flag in 'cpoptions' for this?  More
    general: Add an option to allow "c" to work with a null motion.
-   Give better error messages by using errno (strerror()).
-   Give "Usage:" error message when command used with wrong arguments (like
    Nvi).
-   Make 'restorescreen' option also work for xterm (and others), replaces the
    SAVE_XTERM_SCREEN define.
7   Support for ":winpos" In xterm: report the current window position.
-   Give warning message when using ":set t_xx=asdf" for a termcap code that
    Vim doesn't know about.  Add flag in 'shortmess'?
6   Add ":che <file>", list all the include paths which lead to this file.
-   For a commandline that has several commands (:s, :d, etc.) summarize the
    changes all together instead of for each command (e.g. for the rot13
    macro).
-   Add command like "[I" that also shows the tree of included files.
-   ":set sm^L" results in ":set s", because short names of options are also
    expanded.  Is there a better way to do this?
-   Add ":@!" command, to ":@" like what ":source!" is to ":source".
8   Add ":@:!": repeat last command with forceit set.
-   Add 't_normal': Used whenever t_me, t_se, t_ue or t_Zr is empty.
-   ":cab map test ^V| je", ":cunab map" doesn't work.	This is vi compatible!
-   CTRL-W CTRL-E and CTRL-W CTRL-Y should move the current window up or down
    if it is not the first or last window.
-   Include-file-search commands should look in the loaded buffer of a file (if
    there is one) instead of the file itself.
7   Change 'nrformats' to include the leader for each format.  Example:
	nrformats=hex:$,binary:b,octal:0
    Add setting of 'nrformats' to syntax files.
-   'path' can become very long, don't use NameBuff for expansion.
-   When unhiding a hidden buffer, put the same line at top of the window as
    the one before hiding it.  Or: keep the same relative cursor position (so
    many percent down the windows).
-   Make it possible for the 'showbreak' to be displayed at the end of the
    line.  Use a comma to separate the part at the end and the start of the
    line?  Highlight the linebreak characters, add flag in 'highlight'.
    Make 'showbreak' local to a window.
-   Some string options should be expanded if they have wildcards, e.g.
    'dictionary' when it is "*.h".
-   Use a specific type for number and boolean options, making it possible to
    change it for specific machines (e.g. when a long is 64 bit).
-   Add option for <Insert> in replace mode going to normal mode. (Nugent)
-   Add a next/previous possibility to "[^I" and friends.
-   Add possibility to change the HOME directory.  Use the directory from the
    passwd file? (Antwerpen)
8   Add commands to push and pop all or individual options. ":setpush tw",
    ":setpop tw", ":setpush all".  Maybe pushing/popping all options is
    sufficient.  ":setflush" resets the option stack?
    How to handle an aborted mapping?  Remember position in tag stack when
    mapping starts, restore it when an error aborts the mapping?
-   Change ":fixdel" into option 'fixdel', t_del will be adjusted each time
    t_bs is set? (Webb)
-   "gc": goto character, move absolute character positions forward, also
    counting newlines.  "gC" goes backwards (Weigert).
-   When doing CTRL-^, redraw buffer with the same topline. (Demirel)  Store
    cursor row and window height to redraw cursor at same percentage of window
    (Webb).
-   Besides remembering the last used line number of a file, also remember the
    column.  Use it with CTRL-^ et. al.
-   Check for non-digits when setting a number option (careful when entering
    hex codes like 0xff).
-   Add option to make "." redo the "@r" command, instead of the last command
    executed by it.  Also to make "." redo the whole mapping.  Basically: redo
    the last TYPED command.
-   Support URL links for ^X^F in Insert mode, like for "gf".
-   Support %name% expansion for "gf" on Windows.
-   Make "gf" work on "file://c:/path/name".  "file:/c:/" and "file:///c:/"
    should also work?
-   Add 'urlpath', used like 'path' for when "gf" used on an URL?
8   When using "gf" on an absolute file name, while editing a remote file
    (starts with scp:// or http://) should prepend the method and machine
    name.
-   When finding an URL or file name, and it doesn't exist, try removing a
    trailing '.'.
-   Add ":path" command modifier.  Should work for every command that takes a
    file name argument, to search for the file name in 'path'.	Use
    find_file_in_path().
-   Highlight control characters on the screen: Shows the difference between
    CTRL-X and "^" followed by "X" (Colon).
-   Integrate parsing of cmdline command and parsing for expansion.
-   Create a program that can translate a .swp file from any machine into a
    form usable by Vim on the current machine.
-   Add ":noro" command: Reset 'ro' flag for all buffers, except ones that have
    a readonly file.  ":noro!" will reset all 'ro' flags.
-   Add a variant of CTRL-V that stops interpretation of more than one
    character.	For entering mappings on the command line where a key contains
    several special characters, e.g. a trailing newline.
-   Make '2' option in 'formatoptions' also work inside comments.
-   Add 's' flag to 'formatoptions': Do not break when inside a string. (Dodt)
-   When window size changed (with the mouse) and made too small, set it back
    to the minimal size.
-   Add "]>" and "[<", shift comment at end of line (command;  /* comment */).
-   Should not call cursorcmd() for each vgetc() in getcmdline().
-   ":split file1 file2" adds two more windows (Webb).
-   Don't give message "Incomplete last line" when editing binary file.
-   Add ":a", ":i" for preloading of named buffers.
-   When entering text, keep other windows on same buffer updated (when a line
    entered)?
-   Check out how screen does output optimizing.  Apparently this is possible
    as an output filter.
-   In dosub() regexec is called twice for the same line.  Try to avoid this.
-   Window updating from memline.c: insert/delete/replace line.
-   Optimize ml_append() for speed, esp. for reading a file.
-   V..c should keep indent when 'ai' is set, just like [count]cc.
-   Updatescript() can be done faster with a string instead of a char.
-   Screen updating is inefficient with CTRL-F and CTRL-B when there are long
    lines.
-   Uppercase characters in Ex commands can be made lowercase?
8   Add option to show characters in text not as "|A" but as decimal ("^129"),
    hex ("\x81") or octal ("\201") or meta (M-x).  Nvi has the 'octal' option
    to switch from hex to octal.  Vile can show unprintable characters in hex
    or in octal.
7   Tighter integration with xxd to edit binary files.  Make it more
    easy/obvious to use.  Command line argument?
-   How does vi detect whether a filter has messed up the screen?  Check source.
    After ":w !command" a wait_return?
-   Improve screen updating code for doput() (use s_ins()).
-   With 'p' command on last line: scroll screen up (also for terminals without
    insert line command).
-   Use insert/delete char when terminal supports it.
-   Optimize screen redraw for slow terminals.
-   Optimize "dw" for long row of spaces (say, 30000).
-   Add "-d null" for editing from a script file without displaying.
-   In Insert mode: Remember the characters that were removed with backspace
    and re-insert them one at a time with <key1>, all together with <key2>.
-   Amiga: Add possibility to set a keymap.  The code in amiga.c does not work
    yet.
-   Implement 'redraw' option.
-   Add special code to 'sections' option to define something else but '{' or
    '}' as the start of a section (e.g. one shiftwidth to the right).
7   Allow using Vim in a pipe: "ls | vim -u xxx.vim - | yyy".  Only needs
    implementing ":w" to stdout in the buffer that was read from stdin.
    Perhaps writing to stdout will work, since stderr is used for the terminal
    I/O.
8   Allow opening an unnamed buffer with ":e !cmd" and ":sp !cmd".  Vile can
    do it.
-   Add commands like ]] and [[ that do not include the line jumped to.
-   When :unab without matching "from" part and several matching "to" parts,
    delete the entry that was used last, instead of the first in the list.
-   Add text justification option.
-   Set boolean options on/off with ":set paste=off", ":set paste=on".
-   After "inv"ing an option show the value: ":set invpaste" gives "paste is
    off".
-   Check handling of CTRL-V and '\' for ":" commands that do not have TRLBAR.
-   When a file cannot be opened but does exist, give error message.
-   Amiga: When 'r' protection bit is not set, file can still be opened but
    gives read errors.  Check protection before opening.
-   When writing check for file exists but no permission, "Permission denied".
-   If file does not exist, check if directory exists.
-   MSDOS: although t_cv and t_ci are not set, do invert char under cursor.
-   Settings edit mode: make file with ":set opt=xx", edit it, parse it as ex
    commands.
-   ":set -w all": list one option per line.
-   Amiga: test for 'w' flag when reading a file.
-   :table command (Webb)
-   Add new operator: clear, make area white (replace with spaces): "g ".
-   Add command to ":read" a file at a certain column (blockwise read?).
-   Add sort of replace mode where case is taken from the old text (Goldfarb).
-   Allow multiple arguments for ":read", read all the files.
-   Support for tabs in specific columns: ":set tabcol=8,20,34,56" (Demirel).
-   Add 'searchdir' option: Directories to search for file name being edited
    (Demirel).
-   Modifier for the put command: Change to linewise, charwise, blockwise, etc.
-   Add commands for saving and restoring options ":set save" "set restore",
    for use in macro's and the like.
-   Keep output from listings in a window, so you can have a look at it while
    working in another window.  Put cmdline in a separate window?
-   Add possibility to put output of Ex commands in a buffer or file, e.g. for
    ":set all".  ":r :set all"?
-   When the 'equalalways' option is set, creating a new window should not
    result in windows to become bigger.  Deleting a window should not result in
    a window to become smaller (Webb).
-   When resizing the whole Vim window, the windows inside should be resized
    proportionally (Webb).
-   Include options directly in option table, no indirect pointers.  Use
    mkopttab to make option table?
-   When doing ":w dir", where "dir" is a directory name, write the current
    file into that directory, with the current file name (without the path)?
-   Support for 'dictionary's that are sorted, makes access a lot faster
    (Haritsis).
-   Add "^Vrx" on the command line, replace with contents of register x.  Used
    instead of CTRL-R to make repeating possible. (Marinichev)
-   Add "^Vb" on the command line, replace with word before or under the
    cursor?
-   Option to make a .swp file only when a change is made (Templeton).
-   Support mapping for replace mode and "r" command (Vi doesn't do this)?
5   Add 'ignorefilecase' option: Ignore case when expanding file names.
    ":e ma<Tab>" would also find "Makefile" on Unix.
8   Sorting of filenames for completion is wrong on systems that ignore
    case of filenames.  Add 'ignorefncase' option.  When set, case in
    filenames is ignored for sorting them. Patch by Mike Williams:
    ~/vim/patches/ignorefncase.  Also change what matches?  Or use another
    option name.
8   Should be able to compile Vim in another directory, with $(srcdir) set to
    where the sources are. Add $(srcdir) in the Makefile in a lot of places.
    (Netherton)
6   Make it configurable when "J" inserts a space or not.  Should not add a
    space after "(", for example.
5   When inserting spaces after the end-of-line for 'virtualedit', use tabs
    when the user wants this (e.g., add a "tab" field to 'virtualedit').
    (Servatius Brandt)


From Elvis:
-   Use "instman.sh" to install manpages?
-   Add ":alias" command.
-   Search patterns:
      \@	match word under cursor.
    but do:
      \@w	match the word under the cursor?
      \@W	match the WORD under the cursor?
8   ":window" command:
    :win +	next window (up)
    :win ++	idem, wrapping
    :win -	previous window (down)
    :win --	idem, wrapping
    :win nr	to window number "nr"
    :win name	to window editing buffer "name"
7   ":cc" compiles a single file (default: current one).  'ccprg'   option is
    program to use with ":cc".  Use ":compile" instead of ":cc"?


From xvi:
-   CTRL-_ : swap 8th bit of character.
-   Add egrep-like regex type, like xvi (Ned Konz) or Perl (Emmanuel Mogenet)


From vile:
-   When horizontal scrolling, use '>' for lines continuing right of a window.
-   Support putting .swp files in /tmp: Command in rc.local to move .swp files
    from /tmp to some directory before deleting files.


Far future and "big" extensions:
-   Instead of using a Makefile and autoconf, use a simple shell script to
    find the C compiler and do everything with C code.  Translate something
    like an Aap recipe and configure.in to C.  Avoids depending on Python,
    thus will work everywhere.  With batch file to find the C compiler it
    would also work on MS-Windows.
-   Make it easy to setup Vim for groups of users: novice vi users, novice
    Vim users, C programmers, xterm users, GUI users,...
-   Change layout of blocks in swap file: Text at the start, with '\n' in
    between lines (just load the file without changes, except for Mac).
    Indexes for lines are from the end of the block backwards.  It's the
    current layout mirrored.
-   Make it possible to edit a register, in a window, like a buffer.
-   Add stuff to syntax highlighting to change the text (upper-case keywords,
    set indent, define other highlighting, etc.).
-   Mode to keep C-code formatted all the time (sort of on-line indent).
-   Several top-level windows in one Vim session.  Be able to use a different
    font in each top-level window.
-   Allow editing above start and below end of buffer (flag in 'virtualedit').
-   Smart cut/paste: recognize words and adjust spaces before/after them.
-   Add open mode, use it when terminal has no cursor positioning.
-   Special "drawing mode": a line is drawn where the cursor is moved to.
    Backspace deletes along the line (from jvim).
-   Implement ":Bset", set option in all buffers.  Also ":Wset", set in all
    windows, ":Aset, set in all arguments and ":Tset", set in all files
    mentioned in the tags file.
    Add buffer/arg range, like in ":2,5B%s/..." (do we really need this???)
    Add search string: "B/*.c/%s/.."?  Or ":F/*.c/%s/.."?
-   Support for underlining (underscore-BS-char), bold (char-BS-char) and other
    standout modes switched on/off with , 'overstrike' option (Reiter).
-   Add vertical mode (Paul Jury, Demirel): "5vdw" deletes a word in five
    lines, "3vitextESC" will insert "text" in three lines, etc..
4   Recognize l, #, p as 'flags' to EX commands:
    :g/RE/#l shall print lines with line numbers and in list format.
    :g/RE/dp shall print lines that are deleted.
    POSIX: Commands where flags shall apply to all lines written: list,
    number, open, print, substitute, visual, &, z.  For other commands, flags
    shall apply to the current line after the command completes.  Examples:
    :7,10j #l Join the lines 7-10 and print the result in list
-   Allow two or more users to edit the same file at the same time.  Changes
    are reflected in each Vim immediately.  Could work with local files but
    also over the internet.  See http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/.

When using "do" or ":diffget" in a buffer with changes in every line an extra
empty line would appear.

SUMMARY
								*iccf* *ICCF*
Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  Please see |kcc|
below or visit the ICCF web site, available at these URLs:

	http://iccf-holland.org/
	http://www.vim.org/iccf/
	http://www.iccf.nl/

You can also sponsor the development of Vim.  Vim sponsors can vote for
features.  See |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.

The Open Publication License applies to the Vim documentation, see
|manual-copyright|.

=== begin of license ===

VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this
	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him.
	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version.
    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes.
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@vim.org>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option.

=== end of license ===

Note:

- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this
  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.

- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a
  |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.

- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.
  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference.

- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
  further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change
  anything in Vim.

- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
  contact information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the
  MODIFIED_BY define.

==============================================================================
Kibaale Children's Centre		*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area is known as Rakai
District.  The population is mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there
is enough food.  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than any other
part of the world.  Some say that it started there.  Estimations are that 10
to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because parents die, there are
many orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children have lost one or both
parents, out of a population of 350,000.  And this is still continuing.

The children need a lot of help.  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future.  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any
religion.

The key to solving the problems in this area is education.  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars.  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There is
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.

Most of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older
sister is taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical
care and schooling is beyond its reach.  To help these needy children, a
sponsorship program was put into place.  A child can be financially adopted.
For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it.

Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.
There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given.
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine.  I helped setting up a
production site for cement slabs.  These are used to build a good latrine.
They are sold below cost price.

There is a small clinic at the project, which provides children and their
family with medical help.  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered.
Immunization programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is
breaking out (measles and cholera have been a problem).
							*donate*
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a
volunteer.  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation.  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps.
When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC.  To do this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please consider one
of these possibilities:

1.  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more).
2.  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more).
3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter
4.  A one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low.  This is because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than
5% is used for administration.  This is possible because this is a small
organization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year.

How do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee as the author of Vim.  I trust the people that are working
at the centre, I know them personally.  Further more, the centre has been
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and is now
under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society.  The centre is
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost).  I have
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993.  The visit reports are
on the ICCF web site.

If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim.org>.

The address of the centre is:

Undo and redo						*undo-redo*

The basics are explained in section |02.5| of the user manual.

1. Undo and redo commands	|undo-commands|
2. Two ways of undo		|undo-two-ways|
3. Undo blocks			|undo-blocks|
4. Undo branches		|undo-branches|
5. Undo persistence		|undo-persistence|
6. Remarks about undo		|undo-remarks|

==============================================================================
1. Undo and redo commands				*undo-commands*

<Undo>		or					*undo* *<Undo>* *u*
u			Undo [count] changes.  {Vi: only one level}

							*:u* *:un* *:undo*
:u[ndo]			Undo one change.  {Vi: only one level}
								*E830*
:u[ndo] {N}		Jump to after change number {N}.  See |undo-branches|
			for the meaning of {N}.  {not in Vi}

							*CTRL-R*
CTRL-R			Redo [count] changes which were undone.  {Vi: redraw
			screen}

							*:red* *:redo* *redo*
:red[o]			Redo one change which was undone.  {Vi: no redo}

							*U*
U			Undo all latest changes on one line, the line where
			the latest change was made. |U| itself also counts as
			a change, and thus |U| undoes a previous |U|.
			{Vi: while not moved off of the last modified line}

The last changes are remembered.  You can use the undo and redo commands above
to revert the text to how it was before each change.  You can also apply the
changes again, getting back the text before the undo.

The "U" command is treated by undo/redo just like any other command.  Thus a
"u" command undoes a "U" command and a 'CTRL-R' command redoes it again.  When
mixing "U", "u" and 'CTRL-R' you will notice that the "U" command will
restore the situation of a line to before the previous "U" command.  This may
be confusing.  Try it out to get used to it.
The "U" command will always mark the buffer as changed.  When "U" changes the
buffer back to how it was without changes, it is still considered changed.
Use "u" to undo changes until the buffer becomes unchanged.

==============================================================================
2. Two ways of undo					*undo-two-ways*

How undo and redo commands work depends on the 'u' flag in 'cpoptions'.
There is the Vim way ('u' excluded) and the Vi-compatible way ('u' included).
In the Vim way, "uu" undoes two changes.  In the Vi-compatible way, "uu" does
nothing (undoes an undo).

'u' excluded, the Vim way:
You can go back in time with the undo command.  You can then go forward again
with the redo command.  If you make a new change after the undo command,
the redo will not be possible anymore.

'u' included, the Vi-compatible way:
The undo command undoes the previous change, and also the previous undo command.
The redo command repeats the previous undo command.  It does NOT repeat a
change command, use "." for that.

Examples	Vim way			Vi-compatible way	~
"uu"		two times undo		no-op
"u CTRL-R"	no-op			two times undo

Rationale:  Nvi uses the "." command instead of CTRL-R.  Unfortunately, this
	    is not Vi compatible.  For example "dwdwu." in Vi deletes two
	    words, in Nvi it does nothing.

==============================================================================
3. Undo blocks						*undo-blocks*

One undo command normally undoes a typed command, no matter how many changes
that command makes.  This sequence of undo-able changes forms an undo block.
Thus if the typed key(s) call a function, all the commands in the function are
undone together.

If you want to write a function or script that doesn't create a new undoable
change but joins in with the previous change use this command:

						*:undoj* *:undojoin* *E790*
:undoj[oin]		Join further changes with the previous undo block.
			Warning: Use with care, it may prevent the user from
			properly undoing changes.  Don't use this after undo
			or redo.
			{not in Vi}

This is most useful when you need to prompt the user halfway through a change.
For example in a function that calls |getchar()|.  Do make sure that there was
a related change before this that you must join with.

This doesn't work by itself, because the next key press will start a new
change again.  But you can do something like this: >

	:undojoin | delete

After this an "u" command will undo the delete command and the previous
change.

To do the opposite, break a change into two undo blocks, in Insert mode use
CTRL-G u.  This is useful if you want an insert command to be undoable in
parts.  E.g., for each sentence.  |i_CTRL-G_u|
Setting the value of 'undolevels' also breaks undo.  Even when the new value
is equal to the old value.

==============================================================================
4. Undo branches				*undo-branches* *undo-tree*

Above we only discussed one line of undo/redo.  But it is also possible to
branch off.  This happens when you undo a few changes and then make a new
change.  The undone changes become a branch.  You can go to that branch with
the following commands.

This is explained in the user manual: |usr_32.txt|.

							*:undol* *:undolist*
:undol[ist]		List the leafs in the tree of changes.  Example:
			   number changes  when               saved ~
			       88      88  2010/01/04 14:25:53
			      108     107  08/07 12:47:51
			      136      46  13:33:01             7
			      166     164  3 seconds ago

			The "number" column is the change number.  This number
			continuously increases and can be used to identify a
			specific undo-able change, see |:undo|.
			The "changes" column is the number of changes to this
			leaf from the root of the tree.
			The "when" column is the date and time when this
			change was made.  The four possible formats are:
			    N seconds ago
			    HH:MM:SS             hour, minute, seconds
			    MM/DD HH:MM:SS       idem, with month and day
			    YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS  idem, with year
			The "saved" column specifies, if this change was
			written to disk and which file write it was. This can
			be used with the |:later| and |:earlier| commands.
			For more details use the |undotree()| function.

							*g-*
g-			Go to older text state.  With a count repeat that many
			times.  {not in Vi}
							*:ea* *:earlier*
:earlier {count}	Go to older text state {count} times.
:earlier {N}s		Go to older text state about {N} seconds before.
:earlier {N}m		Go to older text state about {N} minutes before.
:earlier {N}h		Go to older text state about {N} hours before.
:earlier {N}d		Go to older text state about {N} days before.

:earlier {N}f		Go to older text state {N} file writes before.
			When changes were made since the last write
			":earlier 1f" will revert the text to the state when
			it was written.  Otherwise it will go to the write
			before that.
			When at the state of the first file write, or when
			the file was not written, ":earlier 1f" will go to
			before the first change.

							*g+*
g+			Go to newer text state.  With a count repeat that many
			times.  {not in Vi}
							*:lat* *:later*
:later {count}		Go to newer text state {count} times.
:later {N}s		Go to newer text state about {N} seconds later.
:later {N}m		Go to newer text state about {N} minutes later.
:later {N}h		Go to newer text state about {N} hours later.
:later {N}d		Go to newer text state about {N} days later.

:later {N}f		Go to newer text state {N} file writes later.
			When at the state of the last file write, ":later 1f"
			will go to the newest text state.


Note that text states will become unreachable when undo information is cleared
for 'undolevels'.

Don't be surprised when moving through time shows multiple changes to take
place at a time.  This happens when moving through the undo tree and then
making a new change.

EXAMPLE

Start with this text:
	one two three ~

Delete the first word by pressing "x" three times:
	ne two three ~
	e two three ~
	 two three ~

Now undo that by pressing "u" three times:
	e two three ~
	ne two three ~
	one two three ~

Delete the second word by pressing "x" three times:
	one wo three ~
	one o three ~
	one  three ~

Now undo that by using "g-" three times:
	one o three ~
	one wo three ~
	 two three ~

You are now back in the first undo branch, after deleting "one".  Repeating
"g-" will now bring you back to the original text:
	e two three ~
	ne two three ~
	one two three ~

Jump to the last change with ":later 1h":
	one  three ~

And back to the start again with ":earlier 1h":
	one two three ~


Note that using "u" and CTRL-R will not get you to all possible text states
while repeating "g-" and "g+" does.

==============================================================================
5. Undo persistence		*undo-persistence* *persistent-undo*

When unloading a buffer Vim normally destroys the tree of undos created for
that buffer.  By setting the 'undofile' option, Vim will automatically save
your undo history when you write a file and restore undo history when you edit
the file again.

The 'undofile' option is checked after writing a file, before the BufWritePost
autocommands.  If you want to control what files to write undo information
for, you can use a BufWritePre autocommand: >
	au BufWritePre /tmp/* setlocal noundofile

Vim saves undo trees in a separate undo file, one for each edited file, using
a simple scheme that maps filesystem paths directly to undo files. Vim will
detect if an undo file is no longer synchronized with the file it was written
for (with a hash of the file contents) and ignore it when the file was changed
after the undo file was written, to prevent corruption.  An undo file is also
ignored if its owner differs from the owner of the edited file, except when
the owner of the undo file is the current user.  Set 'verbose' to get a
message about that when opening a file.

Undo files are normally saved in the same directory as the file.  This can be
changed with the 'undodir' option.

When the file is encrypted, the text in the undo file is also crypted.  The
same key and method is used. |encryption|

You can also save and restore undo histories by using ":wundo" and ":rundo"
respectively:
							*:wundo* *:rundo*
:wundo[!] {file}
		Write undo history to {file}.
		When {file} exists and it does not look like an undo file
		(the magic number at the start of the file is wrong), then
		this fails, unless the ! was added.
		If it exists and does look like an undo file it is
		overwritten. If there is no undo-history, nothing will be 
		written.
		Implementation detail: Overwriting happens by first deleting
		the existing file and then creating a new file with the same
		name. So it is not possible to overwrite an existing undofile
		in a write-protected directory.
		{not in Vi}

:rundo {file}	Read undo history from {file}.
		{not in Vi}

You can use these in autocommands to explicitly specify the name of the
history file.  E.g.: >

	au BufReadPost * call ReadUndo()
	au BufWritePost * call WriteUndo()
	func ReadUndo()
	  if filereadable(expand('%:h'). '/UNDO/' . expand('%:t'))
	    rundo %:h/UNDO/%:t
	  endif
	endfunc
	func WriteUndo()
	  let dirname = expand('%:h') . '/UNDO'
	  if !isdirectory(dirname)
	    call mkdir(dirname)
	  endif
	  wundo %:h/UNDO/%:t
	endfunc

You should keep 'undofile' off, otherwise you end up with two undo files for
every write.

You can use the |undofile()| function to find out the file name that Vim would
use.

Note that while reading/writing files and 'undofile' is set most errors will
be silent, unless 'verbose' is set.  With :wundo and :rundo you will get more
error messages, e.g., when the file cannot be read or written.

NOTE: undo files are never deleted by Vim.  You need to delete them yourself.

Reading an existing undo file may fail for several reasons:
*E822*	It cannot be opened, because the file permissions don't allow it.
*E823*	The magic number at the start of the file doesn't match.  This usually
	means it is not an undo file.
*E824*	The version number of the undo file indicates that it's written by a
	newer version of Vim.  You need that newer version to open it.  Don't
	write the buffer if you want to keep the undo info in the file.
"File contents changed, cannot use undo info"
	The file text differs from when the undo file was written.  This means
	the undo file cannot be used, it would corrupt the text.  This also
	happens when 'encoding' differs from when the undo file was written.
*E825*  The undo file does not contain valid contents and cannot be used.
*E826*  The undo file is encrypted but decryption failed.
*E827*  The undo file is encrypted but this version of Vim does not support
	encryption.  Open the file with another Vim.
*E832*  The undo file is encrypted but 'key' is not set, the text file is not
	encrypted.  This would happen if the text file was written by Vim
	encrypted at first, and later overwritten by not encrypted text.
	You probably want to delete this undo file.
"Not reading undo file, owner differs"
	The undo file is owned by someone else than the owner of the text
	file.  For safety the undo file is not used.

Writing an undo file may fail for these reasons:
*E828*	The file to be written cannot be created.  Perhaps you do not have
	write permissions in the directory.
"Cannot write undo file in any directory in 'undodir'"
	None of the directories in 'undodir' can be used.
"Will not overwrite with undo file, cannot read"
	A file exists with the name of the undo file to be written, but it
	cannot be read.  You may want to delete this file or rename it.
"Will not overwrite, this is not an undo file"
	A file exists with the name of the undo file to be written, but it
	does not start with the right magic number.  You may want to delete
	this file or rename it.
"Skipping undo file write, nothing to undo"
	There is no undo information to be written, nothing has been changed
	or 'undolevels' is negative.
*E829*	An error occurred while writing the undo file.  You may want to try
	again.

==============================================================================
6. Remarks about undo					*undo-remarks*

The number of changes that are remembered is set with the 'undolevels' option.
If it is zero, the Vi-compatible way is always used.  If it is negative no
undo is possible.  Use this if you are running out of memory.

							*clear-undo*
When you set 'undolevels' to -1 the undo information is not immediately
cleared, this happens at the next change.  To force clearing the undo
information you can use these commands: >
	:let old_undolevels = &undolevels
	:set undolevels=-1
	:exe "normal a \<BS>\<Esc>"
	:let &undolevels = old_undolevels
	:unlet old_undolevels

Marks for the buffer ('a to 'z) are also saved and restored, together with the
text.  {Vi does this a little bit different}

When all changes have been undone, the buffer is not considered to be changed.
It is then possible to exit Vim with ":q" instead of ":q!" {not in Vi}.  Note
that this is relative to the last write of the file.  Typing "u" after ":w"
actually changes the buffer, compared to what was written, so the buffer is
considered changed then.

When manual |folding| is being used, the folds are not saved and restored.
Only changes completely within a fold will keep the fold as it was, because
the first and last line of the fold don't change.

The numbered registers can also be used for undoing deletes.  Each time you
delete text, it is put into register "1.  The contents of register "1 are
shifted to "2, etc.  The contents of register "9 are lost.  You can now get
back the most recent deleted text with the put command: '"1P'.  (also, if the
deleted text was the result of the last delete or copy operation, 'P' or 'p'
also works as this puts the contents of the unnamed register).  You can get
back the text of three deletes ago with '"3P'.

						*redo-register*
If you want to get back more than one part of deleted text, you can use a
special feature of the repeat command ".".  It will increase the number of the
register used.  So if you first do ""1P", the following "." will result in a
'"2P'.  Repeating this will result in all numbered registers being inserted.

Example:	If you deleted text with 'dd....' it can be restored with
		'"1P....'.

If you don't know in which register the deleted text is, you can use the
:display command.  An alternative is to try the first register with '"1P', and
if it is not what you want do 'u.'.  This will remove the contents of the
first put, and repeat the put command for the second register.  Repeat the
'u.' until you got what you want.

		     VIM USER MANUAL - by Bram Moolenaar

			      About the manuals


This chapter introduces the manuals available with Vim.  Read this to know the
conditions under which the commands are explained.

|01.1|	Two manuals
|01.2|	Vim installed
|01.3|	Using the Vim tutor
|01.4|	Copyright

     Next chapter: |usr_02.txt|  The first steps in Vim
Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*01.1*	Two manuals

The Vim documentation consists of two parts:

1. The User manual
   Task oriented explanations, from simple to complex.  Reads from start to
   end like a book.

2. The Reference manual
   Precise description of how everything in Vim works.

The notation used in these manuals is explained here: |notation|


JUMPING AROUND

The text contains hyperlinks between the two parts, allowing you to quickly
jump between the description of an editing task and a precise explanation of
the commands and options used for it.  Use these two commands:

	Press  CTRL-]  to jump to a subject under the cursor.
	Press  CTRL-O  to jump back (repeat to go further back).

Many links are in vertical bars, like this: |bars|.  The bars themselves may
be hidden or invisible, see below.  An option name, like 'number', a command
in double quotes like ":write" and any other word can also be used as a link.
Try it out: Move the cursor to  CTRL-]  and press CTRL-] on it.

Other subjects can be found with the ":help" command, see |help.txt|.

The bars and stars are usually hidden with the |conceal| feature.  They also
use |hl-Ignore|, using the same color for the text as the background.  You can
make them visible with: >
	:set conceallevel=0
	:hi link HelpBar Normal
	:hi link HelpStar Normal

==============================================================================
*01.2*	Vim installed

Most of the manuals assume that Vim has been properly installed.  If you
didn't do that yet, or if Vim doesn't run properly (e.g., files can't be found
or in the GUI the menus do not show up) first read the chapter on
installation: |usr_90.txt|.
							*not-compatible*
The manuals often assume you are using Vim with Vi-compatibility switched
off.  For most commands this doesn't matter, but sometimes it is important,
e.g., for multi-level undo.  An easy way to make sure you are using a nice
setup is to copy the example vimrc file.  By doing this inside Vim you don't
have to check out where it is located.  How to do this depends on the system
you are using:

Unix: >
	:!cp -i $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc
MS-DOS, MS-Windows, OS/2: >
	:!copy $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim $VIM/_vimrc
Amiga: >
	:!copy $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim $VIM/.vimrc

If the file already exists you probably want to keep it.

If you start Vim now, the 'compatible' option should be off.  You can check it
with this command: >

	:set compatible?

If it responds with "nocompatible" you are doing well.  If the response is
"compatible" you are in trouble.  You will have to find out why the option is
still set.  Perhaps the file you wrote above is not found.  Use this command
to find out: >

	:scriptnames

If your file is not in the list, check its location and name.  If it is in the
list, there must be some other place where the 'compatible' option is switched
back on.

For more info see |vimrc| and |compatible-default|.

	Note:
	This manual is about using Vim in the normal way.  There is an
	alternative called "evim" (easy Vim).  This is still Vim, but used in
	a way that resembles a click-and-type editor like Notepad.  It always
	stays in Insert mode, thus it feels very different.  It is not
	explained in the user manual, since it should be mostly self
	explanatory.  See |evim-keys| for details.

==============================================================================
*01.3*	Using the Vim tutor				*tutor* *vimtutor*

Instead of reading the text (boring!) you can use the vimtutor to learn your
first Vim commands.  This is a 30 minute tutorial that teaches the most basic
Vim functionality hands-on.

On Unix, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start it from the shell:
>
	vimtutor

On MS-Windows you can find it in the Program/Vim menu.  Or execute
vimtutor.bat in the $VIMRUNTIME directory.

This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without
the risk of damaging the original.
   There are a few translated versions of the tutor.  To find out if yours is
available, use the two-letter language code.  For French: >

	vimtutor fr

On Unix, if you prefer using the GUI version of Vim, use "gvimtutor" or
"vimtutor -g" instead of "vimtutor".

For OpenVMS, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start vimtutor from a
VMS prompt with: >

	@VIM:vimtutor

Optionally add the two-letter language code as above.


On other systems, you have to do a little work:

1. Copy the tutor file.  You can do this with Vim (it knows where to find it):
>
	vim -u NONE -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
<
   This will write the file "TUTORCOPY" in the current directory.  To use a
translated version of the tutor, append the two-letter language code to the
filename.  For French:
>
	vim -u NONE -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor.fr' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
<
2. Edit the copied file with Vim:
>
	vim -u NONE -c "set nocp" TUTORCOPY
<
   The extra arguments make sure Vim is started in a good mood.

3. Delete the copied file when you are finished with it:
>
	del TUTORCOPY
<

			    The first steps in Vim


This chapter provides just enough information to edit a file with Vim.  Not
well or fast, but you can edit.  Take some time to practice with these
commands, they form the base for what follows.

|02.1|	Running Vim for the First Time
|02.2|	Inserting text
|02.3|	Moving around
|02.4|	Deleting characters
|02.5|	Undo and Redo
|02.6|	Other editing commands
|02.7|	Getting out
|02.8|	Finding help

Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*02.1*	Running Vim for the First Time

To start Vim, enter this command: >

	gvim file.txt

In UNIX you can type this at any command prompt.  If you are running Microsoft
Windows, open an MS-DOS prompt window and enter the command.
   In either case, Vim starts editing a file called file.txt.  Because this
is a new file, you get a blank window. This is what your screen will look
like:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|#					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|"file.txt" [New file]			|
	+---------------------------------------+
		('#" is the cursor position.)

The tilde (~) lines indicate lines not in the file.  In other words, when Vim
runs out of file to display, it displays tilde lines.  At the bottom of the
screen, a message line indicates the file is named file.txt and shows that you
are creating a new file.  The message information is temporary and other
information overwrites it.


THE VIM COMMAND

The gvim command causes the editor to create a new window for editing.  If you
use this command: >

	vim file.txt

the editing occurs inside your command window.  In other words, if you are
running inside an xterm, the editor uses your xterm window.  If you are using
an MS-DOS command prompt window under Microsoft Windows, the editing occurs
inside this window.  The text in the window will look the same for both
versions, but with gvim you have extra features, like a menu bar.  More about
that later.

==============================================================================
*02.2*	Inserting text

The Vim editor is a modal editor.  That means that the editor behaves
differently, depending on which mode you are in.  The two basic modes are
called Normal mode and Insert mode.  In Normal mode the characters you type
are commands.  In Insert mode the characters are inserted as text.
   Since you have just started Vim it will be in Normal mode.  To start Insert
mode you type the "i" command (i for Insert).  Then you can enter
the text.  It will be inserted into the file.  Do not worry if you make
mistakes; you can correct them later.  To enter the following programmer's
limerick, this is what you type: >

	iA very intelligent turtle
	Found programming UNIX a hurdle

After typing "turtle" you press the <Enter> key to start a new line.  Finally
you press the <Esc> key to stop Insert mode and go back to Normal mode.  You
now have two lines of text in your Vim window:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A very intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming UNIX a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|					|
	+---------------------------------------+


WHAT IS THE MODE?

To be able to see what mode you are in, type this command: >

	:set showmode

You will notice that when typing the colon Vim moves the cursor to the last
line of the window.  That's where you type colon commands (commands that start
with a colon).  Finish this command by pressing the <Enter> key (all commands
that start with a colon are finished this way).
   Now, if you type the "i" command Vim will display --INSERT-- at the bottom
of the window.  This indicates you are in Insert mode.

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A very intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming UNIX a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|-- INSERT --				|
	+---------------------------------------+

If you press <Esc> to go back to Normal mode the last line will be made blank.


GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE

One of the problems for Vim novices is mode confusion, which is caused by
forgetting which mode you are in or by accidentally typing a command that
switches modes.  To get back to Normal mode, no matter what mode you are in,
press the <Esc> key.  Sometimes you have to press it twice.  If Vim beeps back
at you, you already are in Normal mode.

==============================================================================
*02.3*	Moving around

After you return to Normal mode, you can move around by using these keys:

	h   left						*hjkl*
	j   down
	k   up
	l   right

At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).

	Note:
	You can also move the cursor by using the arrow keys.  If you do,
	however, you greatly slow down your editing because to press the arrow
	keys, you must move your hand from the text keys to the arrow keys.
	Considering that you might be doing it hundreds of times an hour, this
	can take a significant amount of time.
	   Also, there are keyboards which do not have arrow keys, or which
	locate them in unusual places; therefore, knowing the use of the hjkl
	keys helps in those situations.

One way to remember these commands is that h is on the left, l is on the
right and j points down.  In a picture: >

		       k
		   h     l
		     j

The best way to learn these commands is by using them.  Use the "i" command to
insert some more lines of text.  Then use the hjkl keys to move around and
insert a word somewhere.  Don't forget to press <Esc> to go back to Normal
mode.  The |vimtutor| is also a nice way to learn by doing.

For Japanese users, Hiroshi Iwatani suggested using this:

			Komsomolsk
			    ^
			    |
	   Huan Ho	<--- --->  Los Angeles
	(Yellow river)	    |
			    v
			  Java (the island, not the programming language)

==============================================================================
*02.4*	Deleting characters

To delete a character, move the cursor over it and type "x".  (This is a
throwback to the old days of the typewriter, when you deleted things by typing
xxxx over them.)  Move the cursor to the beginning of the first line, for
example, and type xxxxxxx (seven x's) to delete "A very ".  The result should
look like this:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|intelligent turtle			|
	|Found programming UNIX a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|					|
	+---------------------------------------+

Now you can insert new text, for example by typing: >

	iA young <Esc>

This begins an insert (the i), inserts the words "A young", and then exits
insert mode (the final <Esc>).	The result:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A young intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming UNIX a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|					|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE

To delete a whole line use the "dd" command.  The following line will
then move up to fill the gap:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|Found programming UNIX a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|					|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE BREAK

In Vim you can join two lines together, which means that the line break
between them is deleted.  The "J" command does this.
   Take these two lines:

	A young intelligent ~
	turtle ~

Move the cursor to the first line and press "J":

	A young intelligent turtle ~

==============================================================================
*02.5*	Undo and Redo

Suppose you delete too much.  Well, you can type it in again, but an easier
way exists.  The "u" command undoes the last edit.  Take a look at this in
action: After using "dd" to delete the first line, "u" brings it back.
   Another one: Move the cursor to the A in the first line:

	A young intelligent turtle ~

Now type xxxxxxx to delete "A young".  The result is as follows:

	 intelligent turtle ~

Type "u" to undo the last delete.  That delete removed the g, so the undo
restores the character.

	g intelligent turtle ~

The next u command restores the next-to-last character deleted:

	ng intelligent turtle ~

The next u command gives you the u, and so on:

	ung intelligent turtle ~
	oung intelligent turtle ~
	young intelligent turtle ~
	 young intelligent turtle ~
	A young intelligent turtle ~

	Note:
	If you type "u" twice, and the result is that you get the same text
	back, you have Vim configured to work Vi compatible.  Look here to fix
	this: |not-compatible|.
	   This text assumes you work "The Vim Way".  You might prefer to use
	the good old Vi way, but you will have to watch out for small
	differences in the text then.


REDO

If you undo too many times, you can press CTRL-R (redo) to reverse the
preceding command.  In other
