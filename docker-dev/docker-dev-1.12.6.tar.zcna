test::round($i);  is( $i,  1.0 );
.Ve
.PP
Running "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" should now print out that all nine tests are okay.
.PP
Notice that in these new test cases, the argument passed to round was a
scalar variable.  You might be wondering if you can round a constant or
literal.  To see what happens, temporarily add the following line to Mytest.t:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        &Mytest::round(3);
.Ve
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and notice that Perl dies with a fatal error.  Perl won't
let you change the value of constants!
.SS "What's new here?"
.IX Subsection "What's new here?"
.IP "\(bu" 4
We've made some changes to Makefile.PL.  In this case, we've specified an
extra library to be linked into the extension's shared library, the math
library libm in this case.  We'll talk later about how to write XSUBs that
can call every routine in a library.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The value of the function is not being passed back as the function's return
value, but by changing the value of the variable that was passed into the
function.  You might have guessed that when you saw that the return value
of round is of type \*(L"void\*(R".
.SS "Input and Output Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Input and Output Parameters"
You specify the parameters that will be passed into the \s-1XSUB\s0 on the line(s)
after you declare the function's return value and name.  Each input parameter
line starts with optional whitespace, and may have an optional terminating
semicolon.
.PP
The list of output parameters occurs at the very end of the function, just
after the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 directive.  The use of \s-1RETVAL\s0 tells Perl that you
wish to send this value back as the return value of the \s-1XSUB\s0 function.  In
Example 3, we wanted the \*(L"return value\*(R" placed in the original variable
which we passed in, so we listed it (and not \s-1RETVAL\s0) in the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 section.
.SS "The \s-1XSUBPP\s0 Program"
.IX Subsection "The XSUBPP Program"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program takes the \s-1XS\s0 code in the .xs file and translates it into
C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code created makes
heavy use of the C functions within Perl.
.SS "The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 file"
.IX Subsection "The TYPEMAP file"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program uses rules to convert from Perl's data types (scalar,
array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char, etc.).  These rules are stored
in the typemap file ($PERLLIB/ExtUtils/typemap).  There's a brief discussion
below, but all the nitty-gritty details can be found in perlxstypemap.
If you have a new-enough version of perl (5.16 and up) or an upgraded
\&\s-1XS\s0 compiler (\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::ParseXS\*(C'\fR 3.13_01 or better), then you can inline
typemaps in your \s-1XS\s0 instead of writing separate files.
Either way, this typemap thing is split into three parts:
.PP
The first section maps various C data types to a name, which corresponds
somewhat with the various Perl types.  The second section contains C code
which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle input parameters.  The third section contains
C code which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle output parameters.
.PP
Let's take a look at a portion of the .c file created for our extension.
The file name is Mytest.c:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        XS(XS_Mytest_round)
\&        {
\&            dXSARGS;
\&            if (items != 1)
\&                Perl_croak(aTHX_ "Usage: Mytest::round(arg)");
\&            PERL_UNUSED_VAR(cv); /* \-W */
\&            {
\&                double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));      /* XXXXX */
\&                if (arg > 0.0) {
\&                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
\&                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
\&                        arg = ceil(arg \- 0.5);
\&                } else {
\&                        arg = 0.0;
\&                }
\&                sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);   /* XXXXX */
\&                SvSETMAGIC(ST(0));
\&            }
\&            XSRETURN_EMPTY;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Notice the two lines commented with \*(L"\s-1XXXXX\*(R". \s0 If you check the first part
of the typemap file (or section), you'll see that doubles are of type
T_DOUBLE.  In the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of the typemap, an argument that is T_DOUBLE
is assigned to the variable arg by calling the routine SvNV on something,
then casting it to double, then assigned to the variable arg.  Similarly,
in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section, once arg has its final value, it is passed to the
sv_setnv function to be passed back to the calling subroutine.  These two
functions are explained in perlguts; we'll talk more later about what
that \*(L"\s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0)\*(R" means in the section on the argument stack.
.SS "Warning about Output Arguments"
.IX Subsection "Warning about Output Arguments"
In general, it's not a good idea to write extensions that modify their input
parameters, as in Example 3.  Instead, you should probably return multiple
values in an array and let the caller handle them (we'll do this in a later
example).  However, in order to better accommodate calling pre-existing C
routines, which often do modify their input parameters, this behavior is
tolerated.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 4\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 4"
In this example, we'll now begin to write XSUBs that will interact with
pre-defined C libraries.  To begin with, we will build a small library of
our own, then let h2xs write our .pm and .xs files for us.
.PP
Create a new directory called Mytest2 at the same level as the directory
Mytest.  In the Mytest2 directory, create another directory called mylib,
and cd into that directory.
.PP
Here we'll create some files that will generate a test library.  These will
include a C source file and a header file.  We'll also create a Makefile.PL
in this directory.  Then we'll make sure that running make at the Mytest2
level will automatically run this Makefile.PL file and the resulting Makefile.
.PP
In the mylib directory, create a file mylib.h that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define TESTVAL 4
\&
\&        extern double   foo(int, long, const char*);
.Ve
.PP
Also create a file mylib.c that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        #include <stdlib.h>
\&        #include "./mylib.h"
\&
\&        double
\&        foo(int a, long b, const char *c)
\&        {
\&                return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
And finally create a file Makefile.PL that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&        $Verbose = 1;
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            NAME   => \*(AqMytest2::mylib\*(Aq,
\&            SKIP   => [qw(all static static_lib dynamic dynamic_lib)],
\&            clean  => {\*(AqFILES\*(Aq => \*(Aqlibmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq},
\&        );
\&
\&
\&        sub MY::top_targets {
\&                \*(Aq
\&        all :: static
\&
\&        pure_all :: static
\&
\&        static ::       libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        libmylib$(LIB_EXT): $(O_FILES)
\&                $(AR) cr libmylib$(LIB_EXT) $(O_FILES)
\&                $(RANLIB) libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Make sure you use a tab and not spaces on the lines beginning with \*(L"$(\s-1AR\s0)\*(R"
and \*(L"$(\s-1RANLIB\s0)\*(R".  Make will not function properly if you use spaces.
It has also been reported that the \*(L"cr\*(R" argument to $(\s-1AR\s0) is unnecessary
on Win32 systems.
.PP
We will now create the main top-level Mytest2 files.  Change to the directory
above Mytest2 and run the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        % h2xs \-O \-n Mytest2 ./Mytest2/mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
This will print out a warning about overwriting Mytest2, but that's okay.
Our files are stored in Mytest2/mylib, and will be untouched.
.PP
The normal Makefile.PL that h2xs generates doesn't know about the mylib
directory.  We need to tell it that there is a subdirectory and that we
will be generating a library in it.  Let's add the argument \s-1MYEXTLIB\s0 to
the WriteMakefile call so that it looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            \*(AqNAME\*(Aq      => \*(AqMytest2\*(Aq,
\&            \*(AqVERSION_FROM\*(Aq => \*(AqMytest2.pm\*(Aq, # finds $VERSION
\&            \*(AqLIBS\*(Aq      => [\*(Aq\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqDEFINE\*(Aq    => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-DHAVE_SOMETHING\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqINC\*(Aq       => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-I/usr/include/other\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqMYEXTLIB\*(Aq => \*(Aqmylib/libmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq,
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
and then at the end add a subroutine (which will override the pre-existing
subroutine).  Remember to use a tab character to indent the line beginning
with \*(L"cd\*(R"!
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        sub MY::postamble {
\&        \*(Aq
\&        $(MYEXTLIB): mylib/Makefile
\&                cd mylib && $(MAKE) $(PASSTHRU)
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Let's also fix the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file so that it accurately reflects the contents
of our extension.  The single line that says \*(L"mylib\*(R" should be replaced by
the following three lines:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        mylib/Makefile.PL
\&        mylib/mylib.c
\&        mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
To keep our namespace nice and unpolluted, edit the .pm file and change
the variable \f(CW@EXPORT\fR to \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR.  Finally, in the
\&.xs file, edit the #include line to read:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #include "mylib/mylib.h"
.Ve
.PP
And also add the following function definition to the end of the .xs file:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Now we also need to create a typemap because the default Perl doesn't
currently support the \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR type.  Include a new \s-1TYPEMAP\s0
section in your \s-1XS\s0 code before the above function:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        TYPEMAP: <<END;
\&        const char *    T_PV
\&        END
.Ve
.PP
Now run perl on the top-level Makefile.PL.  Notice that it also created a
Makefile in the mylib directory.  Run make and watch that it does cd into
the mylib directory and run make in there as well.
.PP
Now edit the Mytest2.t script and change the number of tests to \*(L"4\*(R",
and add the following lines to the end of the script:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "Hello, world!"), 7 );
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "0.0"), 7 );
\&        ok( abs(&Mytest2::foo(0, 0, "\-3.4") \- 0.6) <= 0.01 );
.Ve
.PP
(When dealing with floating-point comparisons, it is best to not check for
equality, but rather that the difference between the expected and actual
result is below a certain amount (called epsilon) which is 0.01 in this case)
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and all should be well. There are some warnings on missing tests
for the Mytest2::mylib extension, but you can ignore them.
.SS "What has happened here?"
.IX Subsection "What has happened here?"
Unlike previous examples, we've now run h2xs on a real include file.  This
has caused some extra goodies to appear in both the .pm and .xs files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In the .xs file, there's now a #include directive with the absolute path to
the mylib.h header file.  We changed this to a relative path so that we
could move the extension directory if we wanted to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There's now some new C code that's been added to the .xs file.  The purpose
of the \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine is to make the values that are #define'd in the
header file accessible by the Perl script (by calling either \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW&Mytest2::TESTVAL\fR).  There's also some \s-1XS\s0 code to allow calls to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The .pm file originally exported the name \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.
This could lead to name clashes.  A good rule of thumb is that if the #define
is only going to be used by the C routines themselves, and not by the user,
they should be removed from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.  Alternately, if you don't
mind using the \*(L"fully qualified name\*(R" of a variable, you could move most
or all of the items from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array into the \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR array.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If our include file had contained #include directives, these would not have
been processed by h2xs.  There is no good solution to this right now.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We've also told Perl about the library that we built in the mylib
subdirectory.  That required only the addition of the \f(CW\*(C`MYEXTLIB\*(C'\fR variable
to the WriteMakefile call and the replacement of the postamble subroutine
to cd into the subdirectory and run make.  The Makefile.PL for the
library is a bit more complicated, but not excessively so.  Again we
replaced the postamble subroutine to insert our own code.  This code
simply specified that the library to be created here was a static archive
library (as opposed to a dynamically loadable library) and provided the
commands to build it.
.SS "Anatomy of .xs file"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of .xs file"
The .xs file of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 4\*(R"\s0 contained some new elements.  To understand
the meaning of these elements, pay attention to the line which reads
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        MODULE = Mytest2                PACKAGE = Mytest2
.Ve
.PP
Anything before this line is plain C code which describes which headers
to include, and defines some convenience functions.  No translations are
performed on this part, apart from having embedded \s-1POD\s0 documentation
skipped over (see perlpod) it goes into the generated output C file as is.
.PP
Anything after this line is the description of \s-1XSUB\s0 functions.
These descriptions are translated by \fBxsubpp\fR into C code which
implements these functions using Perl calling conventions, and which
makes these functions visible from Perl interpreter.
.PP
Pay a special attention to the function \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR.  This name appears
twice in the generated .xs file: once in the first part, as a static C
function, then another time in the second part, when an \s-1XSUB\s0 interface to
this static C function is defined.
.PP
This is quite typical for .xs files: usually the .xs file provides
an interface to an existing C function.  Then this C function is defined
somewhere (either in an external library, or in the first part of .xs file),
and a Perl interface to this function (i.e. \*(L"Perl glue\*(R") is described in the
second part of .xs file.  The situation in \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 1\*(R"\s0, \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0,
and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 3\*(R"\s0, when all the work is done inside the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R", is
somewhat of an exception rather than the rule.
.SS "Getting the fat out of XSUBs"
.IX Subsection "Getting the fat out of XSUBs"
In \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 4\*(R"\s0 the second part of .xs file contained the following
description of an \s-1XSUB:\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Note that in contrast with \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 1\*(R"\s0, \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 3\*(R"\s0,
this description does not contain the actual \fIcode\fR for what is done
during a call to Perl function \fIfoo()\fR.  To understand what is going
on here, one can add a \s-1CODE\s0 section to this \s-1XSUB:\s0
.PP
.Vb 9
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            CODE:
\&                RETVAL = foo(a,b,c);
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
However, these two XSUBs provide almost identical generated C code: \fBxsubpp\fR
compiler is smart enough to figure out the \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR section from the first
two lines of the description of \s-1XSUB. \s0 What about \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section?  In
fact, that is absolutely the same!  The \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section can be removed
as well, \fIas far as \f(CI\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fI section or \f(CI\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fI section\fR is not
specified: \fBxsubpp\fR can see that it needs to generate a function call
section, and will autogenerate the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section too.  Thus one can
shortcut the \s-1XSUB\s0 to become:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
.Ve
.PP
Can we do the same with an \s-1XSUB\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
\&            CODE:
\&                RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0?  To do this, one needs to define a C function \f(CW\*(C`int
is_even(int input)\*(C'\fR.  As we saw in \*(L"Anatomy of .xs file\*(R", a proper place
for this definition is in the first part of .xs file.  In fact a C function
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        int
\&        is_even(int arg)
\&        {
\&                return (arg % 2 == 0);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
is probably overkill for this.  Something as simple as a \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR will
do too:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define is_even(arg)    ((arg) % 2 == 0)
.Ve
.PP
After having this in the first part of .xs file, the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" part becomes
as simple as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
.Ve
.PP
This technique of separation of the glue part from the workhorse part has
obvious tradeoffs: if you want to change a Perl interface, you need to
change two places in your code.  However, it removes a lot of clutter,
and makes the workhorse part independent from idiosyncrasies of Perl calling
convention.  (In fact, there is nothing Perl-specific in the above description,
a different version of \fBxsubpp\fR might have translated this to \s-1TCL\s0 glue or
Python glue as well.)
.SS "More about \s-1XSUB\s0 arguments"
.IX Subsection "More about XSUB arguments"
With the completion of Example 4, we now have an easy way to simulate some
real-life libraries whose interfaces may not be the cleanest in the world.
We shall now continue with a discussion of the arguments passed to the
\&\fBxsubpp\fR compiler.
.PP
When you specify arguments to routines in the .xs file, you are really
passing three pieces of information for each argument listed.  The first
piece is the order of that argument relative to the others (first, second,
etc).  The second is the type of argument, and consists of the type
declaration of the argument (e.g., int, char*, etc).  The third piece is
the calling convention for the argument in the call to the library function.
.PP
While Perl passes arguments to functions by reference,
C passes arguments by value; to implement a C function which modifies data
of one of the \*(L"arguments\*(R", the actual argument of this C function would be
a pointer to the data.  Thus two C functions with declarations
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        int string_length(char *s);
\&        int upper_case_char(char *cp);
.Ve
.PP
may have completely different semantics: the first one may inspect an array
of chars pointed by s, and the second one may immediately dereference \f(CW\*(C`cp\*(C'\fR
and manipulate \f(CW*cp\fR only (using the return value as, say, a success
indicator).  From Perl one would use these functions in
a completely different manner.
.PP
One conveys this info to \fBxsubpp\fR by replacing \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR before the
argument by \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR means that the argument should be passed to a library
function by its address.  The above two function may be XSUB-ified as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        string_length(s)
\&                char *  s
\&
\&        int
\&        upper_case_char(cp)
\&                char    &cp
.Ve
.PP
For example, consider:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        int
\&        foo(a,b)
\&                char    &a
\&                char *  b
.Ve
.PP
The first Perl argument to this function would be treated as a char and assigned
to the variable a, and its address would be passed into the function foo.
The second Perl argument would be treated as a string pointer and assigned to the
variable b.  The \fIvalue\fR of b would be passed into the function foo.  The
actual call to the function foo that \fBxsubpp\fR generates would look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        foo(&a, b);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxsubpp\fR will parse the following function argument lists identically:
.PP
.Vb 3

However, to help ease understanding, it is suggested that you place a \*(L"&\*(R"
next to the variable name and away from the variable type), and place a
\&\*(L"*\*(R" near the variable type, but away from the variable name (as in the
call to foo above).  By doing so, it is easy to understand exactly what
will be passed to the C function; it will be whatever is in the \*(L"last
column\*(R".
.PP
You should take great pains to try to pass the function the type of variable
it wants, when possible.  It will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
.SS "The Argument Stack"
.IX Subsection "The Argument Stack"
If we look at any of the C code generated by any of the examples except
example 1, you will notice a number of references to \s-1ST\s0(n), where n is
usually 0.  \*(L"\s-1ST\*(R"\s0 is actually a macro that points to the n'th argument
on the argument stack.  \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) is thus the first argument on the stack and
therefore the first argument passed to the \s-1XSUB, \fIST\s0\fR\|(1) is the second
argument, and so on.
.PP
When you list the arguments to the \s-1XSUB\s0 in the .xs file, that tells \fBxsubpp\fR
which argument corresponds to which of the argument stack (i.e., the first
one listed is the first argument, and so on).  You invite disaster if you
do not list them in the same order as the function expects them.
.PP
The actual values on the argument stack are pointers to the values passed
in.  When an argument is listed as being an \s-1OUTPUT\s0 value, its corresponding
value on the stack (i.e., \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) if it was the first argument) is changed.
You can verify this by looking at the C code generated for Example 3.
The code for the \fIround()\fR \s-1XSUB\s0 routine contains lines that look like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));
\&        /* Round the contents of the variable arg */
\&        sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);
.Ve
.PP
The arg variable is initially set by taking the value from \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), then is
stored back into \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) at the end of the routine.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to return lists, not just scalars.  This must be
done by manipulating stack values \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(1), etc, in a subtly
different way.  See perlxs for details.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to avoid automatic conversion of Perl function arguments
to C function arguments.  See perlxs for details.  Some people prefer
manual conversion by inspecting \f(CWST(i)\fR even in the cases when automatic
conversion will do, arguing that this makes the logic of an \s-1XSUB\s0 call clearer.
Compare with \*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R" for a similar tradeoff of
a complete separation of \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" and \*(L"workhorse\*(R" parts of an \s-1XSUB.\s0
.PP
While experts may argue about these idioms, a novice to Perl guts may
prefer a way which is as little Perl-guts-specific as possible, meaning
automatic conversion and automatic call generation, as in
\&\*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R".  This approach has the additional
benefit of protecting the \s-1XSUB\s0 writer from future changes to the Perl \s-1API.\s0
.SS "Extending your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Extending your Extension"
Sometimes you might want to provide some extra methods or subroutines
to assist in making the interface between Perl and your extension simpler
or easier to understand.  These routines should live in the .pm file.
Whether they are automatically loaded when the extension itself is loaded
or only loaded when called depends on where in the .pm file the subroutine
definition is placed.  You can also consult AutoLoader for an alternate
way to store and load your extra subroutines.
.SS "Documenting your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Documenting your Extension"
There is absolutely no excuse for not documenting your extension.
Documentation belongs in the .pm file.  This file will be fed to pod2man,
and the embedded documentation will be converted to the manpage format,
then placed in the blib directory.  It will be copied to Perl's
manpage directory when the extension is installed.
.PP
You may intersperse documentation and Perl code within the .pm file.
In fact, if you want to use method autoloading, you must do this,
as the comment inside the .pm file explains.
.PP
See perlpod for more information about the pod format.
.SS "Installing your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Installing your Extension"
Once your extension is complete and passes all its tests, installing it
is quite simple: you simply run \*(L"make install\*(R".  You will either need
to have write permission into the directories where Perl is installed,
or ask your system administrator to run the make for you.
.PP
Alternately, you can specify the exact directory to place the extension's
files by placing a \*(L"PREFIX=/destination/directory\*(R" after the make install.
(or in between the make and install if you have a brain-dead version of make).
This can be very useful if you are building an extension that will eventually
be distributed to multiple systems.  You can then just archive the files in
the destination directory and distribute them to your destination systems.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 5\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 5"
In this example, we'll do some more work with the argument stack.  The
previous examples have all returned only a single value.  We'll now
create an extension that returns an array.
.PP
This extension is very Unix-oriented (struct statfs and the statfs system
call).  If you are not running on a Unix system, you can substitute for
statfs any other function that returns multiple values, you can hard-code
values to be returned to the caller (although this will be a bit harder
to test the error case), or you can simply not do this example.  If you
change the \s-1XSUB,\s0 be sure to fix the test cases to match the changes.

\&        is( scalar(@a), 7 );
.Ve
.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
This example added quite a few new concepts.  We'll take them one at a time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1INIT:\s0 directive contains code that will be placed immediately after
the argument stack is decoded.  C does not allow variable declarations at
arbitrary locations inside a function,
so this is usually the best way to declare local variables needed by the \s-1XSUB.
\&\s0(Alternatively, one could put the whole \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR section into braces, and
put these declarations on top.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
This routine also returns a different number of arguments depending on the
success or failure of the call to statfs.  If there is an error, the error
number is returned as a single-element array.  If the call is successful,
then a 7\-element array is returned.  Since only one argument is passed into
this function, we need room on the stack to hold the 7 values which may be
returned.
.Sp
We do this by using the \s-1PPCODE:\s0 directive, rather than the \s-1CODE:\s0 directive.
This tells \fBxsubpp\fR that we will be managing the return values that will be
put on the argument stack by ourselves.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When we want to place values to be returned to the caller onto the stack,
we use the series of macros that begin with \*(L"\s-1XPUSH\*(R". \s0 There are five
different versions, for placing integers, unsigned integers, doubles,
strings, and Perl scalars on the stack.  In our example, we placed a
Perl scalar onto the stack.  (In fact this is the only macro which
can be used to return multiple values.)
.Sp
The XPUSH* macros will automatically extend the return stack to prevent
it from being overrun.  You push values onto the stack in the order you
want them seen by the calling program.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The values pushed onto the return stack of the \s-1XSUB\s0 are actually mortal \s-1SV\s0's.
They are made mortal so that once the values are copied by the calling
program, the \s-1SV\s0's that held the returned values can be deallocated.
If they were not mortal, then they would continue to exist after the \s-1XSUB\s0
routine returned, but would not be accessible.  This is a memory leak.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If we were interested in performance, not in code compactness, in the success
branch we would not use \f(CW\*(C`XPUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, but \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, and would
pre-extend the stack before pushing the return values:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXTEND(SP, 7);
.Ve
.Sp
The tradeoff is that one needs to calculate the number of return values
in advance (though overextending the stack will not typically hurt
anything but memory consumption).
.Sp
Similarly, in the failure branch we could use \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR \fIwithout\fR extending
the stack: the Perl function reference comes to an \s-1XSUB\s0 on the stack, thus
the stack is \fIalways\fR large enough to take one return value.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 6\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 6"
In this example, we will accept a reference to an array as an input
parameter, and return a reference to an array of hashes.  This will
demonstrate manipulation of complex Perl data types from an \s-1XSUB.\s0
.PP
This extension is somewhat contrived.  It is based on the code in
the previous example.  It calls the statfs function multiple times,
accepting a reference to an array of filenames as input, and returning
a reference to an array of hashes containing the data for each of the
filesystems.

.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
There are a number of new concepts introduced here, described below:
.IP "\(bu" 4
This function does not use a typemap.  Instead, we declare it as accepting
one SV* (scalar) parameter, and returning an SV* value, and we take care of
populating these scalars within the code.  Because we are only returning
one value, we don't need a \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR directive \- instead, we use \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR directives.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When dealing with references, it is important to handle them with caution.
The \f(CW\*(C`INIT:\*(C'\fR block first calls SvGETMAGIC(paths), in case
paths is a tied variable.  Then it checks that \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR returns
true, which indicates that paths is a valid reference.  (Simply
checking \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR won't trigger \s-1FETCH\s0 on a tied variable.)  It
then verifies that the object referenced by paths is an array, using \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR
to dereference paths, and \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR to discover its type.  As an added test,
it checks that the array referenced by paths is non-empty, using the \f(CW\*(C`av_top_index\*(C'\fR
function (which returns \-1 if the array is empty).  The \s-1XSRETURN_UNDEF\s0 macro
is used to abort the \s-1XSUB\s0 and return the undefined value whenever all three of
these conditions are not met.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We manipulate several arrays in this \s-1XSUB. \s0 Note that an array is represented
internally by an AV* pointer.  The functions and macros for manipulating
arrays are similar to the functions in Perl: \f(CW\*(C`av_top_index\*(C'\fR returns the highest
index in an AV*, much like $#array; \f(CW\*(C`av_fetch\*(C'\fR fetches a single scalar value
from an array, given its index; \f(CW\*(C`av_push\*(C'\fR pushes a scalar value onto the
end of the array, automatically extending the array as necessary.
.Sp
Specifically, we read pathnames one at a time from the input array, and
store the results in an output array (results) in the same order.  If
statfs fails, the element pushed onto the return array is the value of
errno after the failure.  If statfs succeeds, though, the value pushed
onto the return array is a reference to a hash containing some of the
information in the statfs structure.
.Sp
As with the return stack, it would be possible (and a small performance win)
to pre-extend the return array before pushing data into it, since we know
how many elements we will return:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        av_extend(results, numpaths);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
We are performing only one hash operation in this function, which is storing
a new scalar under a key using \f(CW\*(C`hv_store\*(C'\fR.  A hash is represented by an HV*
pointer.  Like arrays, the functions for manipulating hashes from an \s-1XSUB\s0
mirror the functionality available from Perl.  See perlguts and perlapi
for details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To create a reference, we use the \f(CW\*(C`newRV\*(C'\fR function.  Note that you can
cast an AV* or an HV* to type SV* in this case (and many others).  This
allows you to take references to arrays, hashes and scalars with the same
function.  Conversely, the \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR function always returns an SV*, which may
need to be cast to the appropriate type if it is something other than a
scalar (check with \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
At this point, xsubpp is doing very little work \- the differences between
Mytest.xs and Mytest.c are minimal.

\&                FILE *          stream
.Ve
.PP
The real work is done in the standard typemap.
.PP
\&\fBBut\fR you lose all the fine stuff done by the perlio layers. This
calls the stdio function \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, which knows nothing about them.
.PP
The standard typemap offers three variants of PerlIO *:
\&\f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR (T_IN), \f(CW\*(C`InOutStream\*(C'\fR (T_INOUT) and \f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR
(T_OUT). A bare \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR is considered a T_INOUT. If it matters
in your code (see below for why it might) #define or typedef
one of the specific names and use that as the argument or result
type in your \s-1XS\s0 file.
.PP
The standard typemap does not contain PerlIO * before perl 5.7,
but it has the three stream variants. Using a PerlIO * directly
is not backwards compatible unless you provide your own typemap.
.PP
For streams coming \fIfrom\fR perl the main difference is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR will get the output PerlIO * \- which may make
a difference on a socket. Like in our example...
.PP
For streams being handed \fIto\fR perl a new file handle is created
(i.e. a reference to a new glob) and associated with the PerlIO *
provided. If the read/write state of the PerlIO * is not correct then you
may get errors or warnings from when the file handle is used.
So if you opened the PerlIO * as \*(L"w\*(R" it should really be an
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR if open as \*(L"r\*(R" it should be an \f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Now, suppose you want to use perlio layers in your \s-1XS.\s0 We'll use the
perlio \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR function as an example.
.PP
In the C part of the \s-1XS\s0 file (above the first \s-1MODULE\s0 line) you
have
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        #define OutputStream    PerlIO *
\&    or
\&        typedef PerlIO *        OutputStream;
.Ve
.PP
And this is the \s-1XS\s0 code:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        int
\&        perlioputs(s, stream)
\&                char *          s

\&        OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
We have to use a \f(CW\*(C`CODE\*(C'\fR section because \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR has the arguments
reversed compared to \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, and we want to keep the arguments the same.
.PP
Wanting to explore this thoroughly, we want to use the stdio \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR
on a PerlIO *. This means we have to ask the perlio system for a stdio
\&\f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        int
\&        perliofputs(s, stream)
\&                char *          s

\&        PREINIT:
\&                FILE *fp = PerlIO_findFILE(stream);
\&        CODE:
\&                if (fp != (FILE*) 0) {
\&                        RETVAL = fputs(s, fp);
\&                } else {
\&                        RETVAL = \-1;
\&                }
\&        OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Note: \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will search the layers for a stdio
layer. If it can't find one, it will call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR to
generate a new stdio \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. Please only call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR if
you want a \fInew\fR \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. It will generate one on each call and push a
new stdio layer. So don't call it repeatedly on the same
file. \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will retrieve the stdio layer once it has been
generated by \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This applies to the perlio system only. For versions before 5.7,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR.

In versions of 5.002 prior to version 5.002b1h, the test.pl file was not
automatically created by h2xs.  This means that you cannot say \*(L"make test\*(R"
to run the test script.  You will need to add the following line before the
\&\*(L"use extension\*(R" statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        use lib \*(Aq./blib\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
In versions 5.000 and 5.001, instead of using the above line, you will need
to use the following line:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib") }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
This document assumes that the executable named \*(L"perl\*(R" is Perl version 5.
Some systems may have installed Perl version 5 as \*(L"perl5\*(R".

perlxstut \- Tutorial for writing XSUBs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This tutorial will educate the reader on the steps involved in creating
a Perl extension.  The reader is assumed to have access to perlguts,
perlapi and perlxs.
.PP
This tutorial starts with very simple examples and becomes more complex,
with each new example adding new features.  Certain concepts may not be
completely explained until later in the tutorial in order to slowly ease
the reader into building extensions.
.PP
This tutorial was written from a Unix point of view.  Where I know them
to be otherwise different for other platforms (e.g. Win32), I will list
them.  If you find something that was missed, please let me know.
.SH "SPECIAL NOTES"
.IX Header "SPECIAL NOTES"
.SS "make"
.IX Subsection "make"
This tutorial assumes that the make program that Perl is configured to
use is called \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR.  Instead of running \*(L"make\*(R" in the examples that
follow, you may have to substitute whatever make program Perl has been
configured to use.  Running \fBperl \-V:make\fR should tell you what it is.
.SS "Version caveat"
.IX Subsection "Version caveat"
When writing a Perl extension for general consumption, one should expect that
the extension will be used with versions of Perl different from the
version available on your machine.  Since you are reading this document,
the version of Perl on your machine is probably 5.005 or later, but the users
of your extension may have more ancient versions.
.PP
To understand what kinds of incompatibilities one may expect, and in the rare
case that the version of Perl on your machine is older than this document,
see the section on \*(L"Troubleshooting these Examples\*(R" for more information.
.PP
If your extension uses some features of Perl which are not available on older
releases of Perl, your users would appreciate an early meaningful warning.
You would probably put this information into the \fI\s-1README\s0\fR file, but nowadays
installation of extensions may be performed automatically, guided by \fI\s-1CPAN\s0.pm\fR
module or other tools.
.PP
In MakeMaker-based installations, \fIMakefile.PL\fR provides the earliest
opportunity to perform version checks.  One can put something like this
in \fIMakefile.PL\fR for this purpose:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    eval { require 5.007 }
\&        or die <<EOD;
\&    ############
\&    ### This module uses frobnication framework which is not available before

.SS "Dynamic Loading versus Static Loading"
.IX Subsection "Dynamic Loading versus Static Loading"
It is commonly thought that if a system does not have the capability to
dynamically load a library, you cannot build XSUBs.  This is incorrect.
You \fIcan\fR build them, but you must link the XSUBs subroutines with the
rest of Perl, creating a new executable.  This situation is similar to
Perl 4.
.PP
This tutorial can still be used on such a system.  The \s-1XSUB\s0 build mechanism
will check the system and build a dynamically-loadable library if possible,
or else a static library and then, optionally, a new statically-linked
executable with that static library linked in.
.PP
Should you wish to build a statically-linked executable on a system which
can dynamically load libraries, you may, in all the following examples,
where the command "\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR\*(L" with no arguments is executed, run the command
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make perl\*(C'\fR" instead.
.PP
If you have generated such a statically-linked executable by choice, then
instead of saying "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L", you should say \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test_static\*(C'\fR\*(L".
On systems that cannot build dynamically-loadable libraries at all, simply
saying \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" is sufficient.
.SH "TUTORIAL"
.IX Header "TUTORIAL"
Now let's go on with the show!
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 1"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 1"
Our first extension will be very simple.  When we call the routine in the
extension, it will print out a well-known message and return.
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`h2xs \-A \-n Mytest\*(C'\fR".  This creates a directory named Mytest,
possibly under ext/ if that directory exists in the current working
directory.  Several files will be created under the Mytest dir, including
\&\s-1MANIFEST\s0, Makefile.PL, lib/Mytest.pm, Mytest.xs, t/Mytest.t, and Changes.
.PP
The \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file contains the names of all the files just created in the
Mytest directory.
.PP
The file Makefile.PL should look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&    # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
\&    # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
\&    WriteMakefile(
\&        NAME         => \*(AqMytest\*(Aq,
\&        VERSION_FROM => \*(AqMytest.pm\*(Aq, # finds $VERSION
\&        LIBS         => [\*(Aq\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
\&        DEFINE       => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-DHAVE_SOMETHING\*(Aq
\&        INC          => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-I/usr/include/other\*(Aq
\&    );
.Ve
.PP
The file Mytest.pm should start with something like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package Mytest;
\&
\&    use 5.008008;
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&
\&    require Exporter;
\&
\&    our @ISA = qw(Exporter);
\&    our %EXPORT_TAGS = ( \*(Aqall\*(Aq => [ qw(
\&
\&    ) ] );
\&
\&    our @EXPORT_OK = ( @{ $EXPORT_TAGS{\*(Aqall\*(Aq} } );
\&
\&    our @EXPORT = qw(
\&
\&    );
\&
\&    our $VERSION = \*(Aq0.01\*(Aq;
\&
\&    require XSLoader;
\&    XSLoader::load(\*(AqMytest\*(Aq, $VERSION);
\&
\&    # Preloaded methods go here.
\&
\&    1;
\&    _\|_END_\|_
\&    # Below is the stub of documentation for your module. You better edit it!
.Ve
.PP
The rest of the .pm file contains sample code for providing documentation for
the extension.
.PP
Finally, the Mytest.xs file should look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    #include "EXTERN.h"
\&    #include "perl.h"
\&    #include "XSUB.h"
\&
\&    #include "ppport.h"
\&
\&    MODULE = Mytest             PACKAGE = Mytest
.Ve
.PP
Let's edit the .xs file by adding this to the end of the file:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    void
\&    hello()
\&        CODE:
\&            printf("Hello, world!\en");
.Ve
.PP
It is okay for the lines starting at the \*(L"\s-1CODE:\s0\*(R" line to not be indented.
However, for readability purposes, it is suggested that you indent \s-1CODE:\s0
one level and the lines following one more level.
.PP
Now we'll run "\f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR".  This will create a real Makefile,
which make needs.  Its output looks something like:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    % perl Makefile.PL
\&    Checking if your kit is complete...
\&    Looks good
\&    Writing Makefile for Mytest
\&    %
.Ve
.PP
Now, running make will produce output that looks something like this (some
long lines have been shortened for clarity and some extraneous lines have
been deleted):
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    % make
\&    cp lib/Mytest.pm blib/lib/Mytest.pm
\&    perl xsubpp  \-typemap typemap  Mytest.xs > Mytest.xsc && mv Mytest.xsc Mytest.c
\&    Please specify prototyping behavior for Mytest.xs (see perlxs manual)
\&    cc \-c     Mytest.c
\&    Running Mkbootstrap for Mytest ()
\&    chmod 644 Mytest.bs
\&    rm \-f blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so
\&    cc  \-shared \-L/usr/local/lib Mytest.o  \-o blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so   \e
\&                \e
\&
\&    chmod 755 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so
\&    cp Mytest.bs blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs
\&    chmod 644 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs
\&    Manifying blib/man3/Mytest.3pm
\&    %
.Ve
.PP
You can safely ignore the line about \*(L"prototyping behavior\*(R" \- it is
explained in \*(L"The \s-1PROTOTYPES:\s0 Keyword\*(R" in perlxs.
.PP
Perl has its own special way of easily writing test scripts, but for this
example only, we'll create our own test script.  Create a file called hello
that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #! /opt/perl5/bin/perl
\&
\&    use ExtUtils::testlib;
\&
\&    use Mytest;
\&
\&    Mytest::hello();
.Ve
.PP
Now we make the script executable (\f(CW\*(C`chmod +x hello\*(C'\fR), run the script
and we should see the following output:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % ./hello
\&    Hello, world!
\&    %
.Ve
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 2"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 2"
Now let's add to our extension a subroutine that will take a single numeric
argument as input and return 1 if the number is even or 0 if the number
is odd.
.PP
Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    int
\&    is_even(input)
\&            int input
\&        CODE:
\&            RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
\&        OUTPUT:
\&            RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
There does not need to be whitespace at the start of the "\f(CW\*(C`int input\*(C'\fR\*(L"
line, but it is useful for improving readability.  Placing a semi-colon at
the end of that line is also optional.  Any amount and kind of whitespace
may be placed between the \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR\*(L" and \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR".
.PP
Now re-run make to rebuild our new shared library.
.PP
Now perform the same steps as before, generating a Makefile from the
Makefile.PL file, and running make.
.PP
In order to test that our extension works, we now need to look at the
file Mytest.t.  This file is set up to imitate the same kind of testing
structure that Perl itself has.  Within the test script, you perform a
number of tests to confirm the behavior of the extension, printing \*(L"ok\*(R"
when the test is correct, \*(L"not ok\*(R" when it is not.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Test::More tests => 4;
\&    BEGIN { use_ok(\*(AqMytest\*(Aq) };
\&
\&    #########################
\&
\&    # Insert your test code below, the Test::More module is use()ed here so read
\&    # its man page ( perldoc Test::More ) for help writing this test script.
\&
\&    is(&Mytest::is_even(0), 1);
\&    is(&Mytest::is_even(1), 0);
\&    is(&Mytest::is_even(2), 1);
.Ve
.PP
We will be calling the test script through the command "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR".  You
should see output that looks something like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    %make test
\&    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/bin/perl "\-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "\-e" "test_harness(0, \*(Aqblib/lib\*(Aq, \*(Aqblib/arch\*(Aq)" t/*.t
\&    t/Mytest....ok
\&    All tests successful.
\&    Files=1, Tests=4,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.03 cusr +  0.00 csys =  0.03 CPU)
\&    %
.Ve
.SS "What has gone on?"
.IX Subsection "What has gone on?"
The program h2xs is the starting point for creating extensions.  In later
examples we'll see how we can use h2xs to read header files and generate
templates to connect to C routines.
.PP
h2xs creates a number of files in the extension directory.  The file
Makefile.PL is a perl script which will generate a true Makefile to build
the extension.  We'll take a closer look at it later.
.PP
The .pm and .xs files contain the meat of the extension.  The .xs file holds
the C routines that make up the extension.  The .pm file contains routines
that tell Perl how to load your extension.
.PP
Generating the Makefile and running \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR created a directory called blib
(which stands for \*(L"build library\*(R") in the current working directory.  This
directory will contain the shared library that we will build.  Once we have
tested it, we can install it into its final location.
.PP
Invoking the test script via "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" did something very important.
It invoked perl with all those \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR arguments so that it could find the
various files that are part of the extension.  It is \fIvery\fR important that
while you are still testing extensions that you use "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L".  If you
try to run the test script all by itself, you will get a fatal error.
Another reason it is important to use \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L" to run your test
script is that if you are testing an upgrade to an already-existing version,
using \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" ensures that you will test your new extension, not the
already-existing version.
.PP
When Perl sees a \f(CW\*(C`use extension;\*(C'\fR, it searches for a file with the same name
as the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR'd extension that has a .pm suffix.  If that file cannot be found,
Perl dies with a fatal error.  The default search path is contained in the
\&\f(CW@INC\fR array.
.PP
In our case, Mytest.pm tells perl that it will need the Exporter and Dynamic
Loader extensions.  It then sets the \f(CW@ISA\fR and \f(CW@EXPORT\fR arrays and the
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR scalar; finally it tells perl to bootstrap the module.  Perl
will call its dynamic loader routine (if there is one) and load the shared
library.
.PP
The two arrays \f(CW@ISA\fR and \f(CW@EXPORT\fR are very important.  The \f(CW@ISA\fR
array contains a list of other packages in which to search for methods (or
subroutines) that do not exist in the current package.  This is usually
only important for object-oriented extensions (which we will talk about
much later), and so usually doesn't need to be modified.
.PP
The \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array tells Perl which of the extension's variables and
subroutines should be placed into the calling package's namespace.  Because
you don't know if the user has already used your variable and subroutine
names, it's vitally important to carefully select what to export.  Do \fInot\fR
export method or variable names \fIby default\fR without a good reason.
.PP
As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object-oriented then don't
export anything.  If it's just a collection of functions and variables, then
you can export them via another array, called \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR.  This array
does not automatically place its subroutine and variable names into the
namespace unless the user specifically requests that this be done.

The \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable is used to ensure that the .pm file and the shared
library are \*(L"in sync\*(R" with each other.  Any time you make changes to
the .pm or .xs files, you should increment the value of this variable.
.SS "Writing good test scripts"
.IX Subsection "Writing good test scripts"
The importance of writing good test scripts cannot be over-emphasized.  You
should closely follow the \*(L"ok/not ok\*(R" style that Perl itself uses, so that
it is very easy and unambiguous to determine the outcome of each test case.
When you find and fix a bug, make sure you add a test case for it.
.PP
By running "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L", you ensure that your Mytest.t script runs and uses
the correct version of your extension.  If you have many test cases,
save your test files in the \*(R"t\*(L" directory and use the suffix \*(R".t\*(L".
When you run \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR", all of these test files will be executed.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 3"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 3"
Our third extension will take one argument as its input, round off that
value, and set the \fIargument\fR to the rounded value.
.PP
Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        void
\&        round(arg)
\&                double  arg
\&            CODE:
\&                if (arg > 0.0) {
\&                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
\&                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
\&                        arg = ceil(arg \- 0.5);
\&                } else {
\&                        arg = 0.0;
\&                }
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                arg
.Ve
.PP
Edit the Makefile.PL file so that the corresponding line looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \*(AqLIBS\*(Aq      => [\*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Generate the Makefile and run make.  Change the test number in Mytest.t to
\&\*(L"9\*(R" and add the following tests:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        $i = \-1.5; &Mytest::round($i); is( $i, \-2.0 );
\&        $i = \-1.1; &Mytest::round($i); is( $i, \-1.0 );
\&        $i = 0.0; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  0.0 );
\&        $i = 0.5; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  1.0 );
\&        $i = 1.2; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  1.0 );
.Ve
.PP
Running "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" should now print out that all nine tests are okay.
.PP
Notice that in these new test cases, the argument passed to round was a
scalar variable.  You might be wondering if you can round a constant or
literal.  To see what happens, temporarily add the following line to Mytest.t:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        &Mytest::round(3);
.Ve
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and notice that Perl dies with a fatal error.  Perl won't
let you change the value of constants!
.SS "What's new here?"
.IX Subsection "What's new here?"
.IP "\(bu" 4
We've made some changes to Makefile.PL.  In this case, we've specified an
extra library to be linked into the extension's shared library, the math
library libm in this case.  We'll talk later about how to write XSUBs that
can call every routine in a library.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The value of the function is not being passed back as the function's return
value, but by changing the value of the variable that was passed into the
function.  You might have guessed that when you saw that the return value
of round is of type \*(L"void\*(R".
.SS "Input and Output Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Input and Output Parameters"
You specify the parameters that will be passed into the \s-1XSUB\s0 on the line(s)
after you declare the function's return value and name.  Each input parameter
line starts with optional whitespace, and may have an optional terminating
semicolon.
.PP
The list of output parameters occurs at the very end of the function, just
after the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 directive.  The use of \s-1RETVAL\s0 tells Perl that you
wish to send this value back as the return value of the \s-1XSUB\s0 function.  In
Example 3, we wanted the \*(L"return value\*(R" placed in the original variable
which we passed in, so we listed it (and not \s-1RETVAL\s0) in the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 section.
.SS "The \s-1XSUBPP\s0 Program"
.IX Subsection "The XSUBPP Program"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program takes the \s-1XS\s0 code in the .xs file and translates it into
C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code created makes
heavy use of the C functions within Perl.
.SS "The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 file"
.IX Subsection "The TYPEMAP file"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program uses rules to convert from Perl's data types (scalar,
array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char, etc.).  These rules are stored
in the typemap file ($PERLLIB/ExtUtils/typemap).  There's a brief discussion
below, but all the nitty-gritty details can be found in perlxstypemap.
If you have a new-enough version of perl (5.16 and up) or an upgraded
\&\s-1XS\s0 compiler (\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::ParseXS\*(C'\fR 3.13_01 or better), then you can inline
typemaps in your \s-1XS\s0 instead of writing separate files.
Either way, this typemap thing is split into three parts:
.PP
The first section maps various C data types to a name, which corresponds
somewhat with the various Perl types.  The second section contains C code
which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle input parameters.  The third section contains
C code which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle output parameters.
.PP
Let's take a look at a portion of the .c file created for our extension.
The file name is Mytest.c:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        XS(XS_Mytest_round)
\&        {
\&            dXSARGS;
\&            if (items != 1)
\&                Perl_croak(aTHX_ "Usage: Mytest::round(arg)");
\&            PERL_UNUSED_VAR(cv); /* \-W */
\&            {
\&                double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));      /* XXXXX */
\&                if (arg > 0.0) {
\&                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
\&                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
\&                        arg = ceil(arg \- 0.5);
\&                } else {
\&                        arg = 0.0;
\&                }
\&                sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);   /* XXXXX */
\&                SvSETMAGIC(ST(0));
\&            }
\&            XSRETURN_EMPTY;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Notice the two lines commented with \*(L"\s-1XXXXX\s0\*(R".  If you check the first part
of the typemap file (or section), you'll see that doubles are of type
T_DOUBLE.  In the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of the typemap, an argument that is T_DOUBLE
is assigned to the variable arg by calling the routine SvNV on something,
then casting it to double, then assigned to the variable arg.  Similarly,
in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section, once arg has its final value, it is passed to the
sv_setnv function to be passed back to the calling subroutine.  These two
functions are explained in perlguts; we'll talk more later about what
that \*(L"\s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0)\*(R" means in the section on the argument stack.
.SS "Warning about Output Arguments"
.IX Subsection "Warning about Output Arguments"
In general, it's not a good idea to write extensions that modify their input
parameters, as in Example 3.  Instead, you should probably return multiple
values in an array and let the caller handle them (we'll do this in a later
example).  However, in order to better accommodate calling pre-existing C
routines, which often do modify their input parameters, this behavior is
tolerated.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 4"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 4"
In this example, we'll now begin to write XSUBs that will interact with
pre-defined C libraries.  To begin with, we will build a small library of
our own, then let h2xs write our .pm and .xs files for us.
.PP
Create a new directory called Mytest2 at the same level as the directory
Mytest.  In the Mytest2 directory, create another directory called mylib,
and cd into that directory.
.PP
Here we'll create some files that will generate a test library.  These will
include a C source file and a header file.  We'll also create a Makefile.PL
in this directory.  Then we'll make sure that running make at the Mytest2
level will automatically run this Makefile.PL file and the resulting Makefile.
.PP
In the mylib directory, create a file mylib.h that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define TESTVAL 4
\&
\&        extern double   foo(int, long, const char*);
.Ve
.PP
Also create a file mylib.c that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        #include <stdlib.h>
\&        #include "./mylib.h"
\&
\&        double
\&        foo(int a, long b, const char *c)
\&        {
\&                return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
And finally create a file Makefile.PL that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&        $Verbose = 1;
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            NAME   => \*(AqMytest2::mylib\*(Aq,
\&            SKIP   => [qw(all static static_lib dynamic dynamic_lib)],
\&            clean  => {\*(AqFILES\*(Aq => \*(Aqlibmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq},
\&        );
\&
\&
\&        sub MY::top_targets {
\&                \*(Aq
\&        all :: static
\&
\&        pure_all :: static
\&
\&        static ::       libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        libmylib$(LIB_EXT): $(O_FILES)
\&                $(AR) cr libmylib$(LIB_EXT) $(O_FILES)
\&                $(RANLIB) libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Make sure you use a tab and not spaces on the lines beginning with \*(L"$(\s-1AR\s0)\*(R"
and \*(L"$(\s-1RANLIB\s0)\*(R".  Make will not function properly if you use spaces.
It has also been reported that the \*(L"cr\*(R" argument to $(\s-1AR\s0) is unnecessary
on Win32 systems.
.PP
We will now create the main top-level Mytest2 files.  Change to the directory
above Mytest2 and run the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        % h2xs \-O \-n Mytest2 ./Mytest2/mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
This will print out a warning about overwriting Mytest2, but that's okay.
Our files are stored in Mytest2/mylib, and will be untouched.
.PP
The normal Makefile.PL that h2xs generates doesn't know about the mylib
directory.  We need to tell it that there is a subdirectory and that we
will be generating a library in it.  Let's add the argument \s-1MYEXTLIB\s0 to
the WriteMakefile call so that it looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            \*(AqNAME\*(Aq      => \*(AqMytest2\*(Aq,
\&            \*(AqVERSION_FROM\*(Aq => \*(AqMytest2.pm\*(Aq, # finds $VERSION
\&            \*(AqLIBS\*(Aq      => [\*(Aq\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqDEFINE\*(Aq    => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-DHAVE_SOMETHING\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqINC\*(Aq       => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-I/usr/include/other\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqMYEXTLIB\*(Aq => \*(Aqmylib/libmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq,
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
and then at the end add a subroutine (which will override the pre-existing
subroutine).  Remember to use a tab character to indent the line beginning
with \*(L"cd\*(R"!
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        sub MY::postamble {
\&        \*(Aq
\&        $(MYEXTLIB): mylib/Makefile
\&                cd mylib && $(MAKE) $(PASSTHRU)
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Let's also fix the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file so that it accurately reflects the contents
of our extension.  The single line that says \*(L"mylib\*(R" should be replaced by
the following three lines:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        mylib/Makefile.PL
\&        mylib/mylib.c
\&        mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
To keep our namespace nice and unpolluted, edit the .pm file and change
the variable \f(CW@EXPORT\fR to \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR.  Finally, in the
\&.xs file, edit the #include line to read:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #include "mylib/mylib.h"
.Ve
.PP
And also add the following function definition to the end of the .xs file:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Now we also need to create a typemap because the default Perl doesn't
currently support the \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR type.  Include a new \s-1TYPEMAP\s0
section in your \s-1XS\s0 code before the above function:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        TYPEMAP: <<END;
\&        const char *    T_PV
\&        END
.Ve
.PP
Now run perl on the top-level Makefile.PL.  Notice that it also created a
Makefile in the mylib directory.  Run make and watch that it does cd into
the mylib directory and run make in there as well.
.PP
Now edit the Mytest2.t script and change the number of tests to \*(L"4\*(R",
and add the following lines to the end of the script:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "Hello, world!"), 7 );
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "0.0"), 7 );
\&        ok( abs(&Mytest2::foo(0, 0, "\-3.4") \- 0.6) <= 0.01 );
.Ve
.PP
(When dealing with floating-point comparisons, it is best to not check for
equality, but rather that the difference between the expected and actual
result is below a certain amount (called epsilon) which is 0.01 in this case)
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and all should be well. There are some warnings on missing tests
for the Mytest2::mylib extension, but you can ignore them.
.SS "What has happened here?"
.IX Subsection "What has happened here?"
Unlike previous examples, we've now run h2xs on a real include file.  This
has caused some extra goodies to appear in both the .pm and .xs files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In the .xs file, there's now a #include directive with the absolute path to
the mylib.h header file.  We changed this to a relative path so that we
could move the extension directory if we wanted to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There's now some new C code that's been added to the .xs file.  The purpose
of the \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine is to make the values that are #define'd in the
header file accessible by the Perl script (by calling either \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW&Mytest2::TESTVAL\fR).  There's also some \s-1XS\s0 code to allow calls to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The .pm file originally exported the name \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.
This could lead to name clashes.  A good rule of thumb is that if the #define
is only going to be used by the C routines themselves, and not by the user,
they should be removed from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.  Alternately, if you don't
mind using the \*(L"fully qualified name\*(R" of a variable, you could move most
or all of the items from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array into the \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR array.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If our include file had contained #include directives, these would not have
been processed by h2xs.  There is no good solution to this right now.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We've also told Perl about the library that we built in the mylib
subdirectory.  That required only the addition of the \f(CW\*(C`MYEXTLIB\*(C'\fR variable
to the WriteMakefile call and the replacement of the postamble subroutine
to cd into the subdirectory and run make.  The Makefile.PL for the
library is a bit more complicated, but not excessively so.  Again we
replaced the postamble subroutine to insert our own code.  This code
simply specified that the library to be created here was a static archive
library (as opposed to a dynamically loadable library) and provided the
commands to build it.
.SS "Anatomy of .xs file"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of .xs file"
The .xs file of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 4\*(R" contained some new elements.  To understand
the meaning of these elements, pay attention to the line which reads
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        MODULE = Mytest2                PACKAGE = Mytest2
.Ve
.PP
Anything before this line is plain C code which describes which headers
to include, and defines some convenience functions.  No translations are
performed on this part, apart from having embedded \s-1POD\s0 documentation
skipped over (see perlpod) it goes into the generated output C file as is.
.PP
Anything after this line is the description of \s-1XSUB\s0 functions.
These descriptions are translated by \fBxsubpp\fR into C code which
implements these functions using Perl calling conventions, and which
makes these functions visible from Perl interpreter.
.PP
Pay a special attention to the function \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR.  This name appears
twice in the generated .xs file: once in the first part, as a static C
function, then another time in the second part, when an \s-1XSUB\s0 interface to
this static C function is defined.
.PP
This is quite typical for .xs files: usually the .xs file provides
an interface to an existing C function.  Then this C function is defined
somewhere (either in an external library, or in the first part of .xs file),
and a Perl interface to this function (i.e. \*(L"Perl glue\*(R") is described in the
second part of .xs file.  The situation in \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 1\*(R", \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 2\*(R",
and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 3\*(R", when all the work is done inside the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R", is
somewhat of an exception rather than the rule.
.SS "Getting the fat out of XSUBs"
.IX Subsection "Getting the fat out of XSUBs"
In \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 4\*(R" the second part of .xs file contained the following
description of an \s-1XSUB:\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Note that in contrast with \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 1\*(R", \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 2\*(R" and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 3\*(R",
this description does not contain the actual \fIcode\fR for what is done
during a call to Perl function \fIfoo()\fR.  To understand what is going
on here, one can add a \s-1CODE\s0 section to this \s-1XSUB:\s0
.PP
.Vb 9
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            CODE:
\&                RETVAL = foo(a,b,c);
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
However, these two XSUBs provide almost identical generated C code: \fBxsubpp\fR
compiler is smart enough to figure out the \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR section from the first
two lines of the description of \s-1XSUB\s0.  What about \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section?  In
fact, that is absolutely the same!  The \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section can be removed
as well, \fIas far as \f(CI\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fI section or \f(CI\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fI section\fR is not
specified: \fBxsubpp\fR can see that it needs to generate a function call
section, and will autogenerate the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section too.  Thus one can
shortcut the \s-1XSUB\s0 to become:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
.Ve
.PP
Can we do the same with an \s-1XSUB\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
\&            CODE:
\&                RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 2\*(R"?  To do this, one needs to define a C function \f(CW\*(C`int
is_even(int input)\*(C'\fR.  As we saw in \*(L"Anatomy of .xs file\*(R", a proper place
for this definition is in the first part of .xs file.  In fact a C function
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        int
\&        is_even(int arg)
\&        {
\&                return (arg % 2 == 0);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
is probably overkill for this.  Something as simple as a \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR will
do too:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define is_even(arg)    ((arg) % 2 == 0)
.Ve
.PP
After having this in the first part of .xs file, the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" part becomes
as simple as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
.Ve
.PP
This technique of separation of the glue part from the workhorse part has
obvious tradeoffs: if you want to change a Perl interface, you need to
change two places in your code.  However, it removes a lot of clutter,
and makes the workhorse part independent from idiosyncrasies of Perl calling
convention.  (In fact, there is nothing Perl-specific in the above description,
a different version of \fBxsubpp\fR might have translated this to \s-1TCL\s0 glue or
Python glue as well.)
.SS "More about \s-1XSUB\s0 arguments"
.IX Subsection "More about XSUB arguments"
With the completion of Example 4, we now have an easy way to simulate some
real-life libraries whose interfaces may not be the cleanest in the world.
We shall now continue with a discussion of the arguments passed to the
\&\fBxsubpp\fR compiler.
.PP
When you specify arguments to routines in the .xs file, you are really
passing three pieces of information for each argument listed.  The first
piece is the order of that argument relative to the others (first, second,
etc).  The second is the type of argument, and consists of the type
declaration of the argument (e.g., int, char*, etc).  The third piece is
the calling convention for the argument in the call to the library function.
.PP
While Perl passes arguments to functions by reference,
C passes arguments by value; to implement a C function which modifies data
of one of the \*(L"arguments\*(R", the actual argument of this C function would be
a pointer to the data.  Thus two C functions with declarations
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        int string_length(char *s);
\&        int upper_case_char(char *cp);
.Ve
.PP
may have completely different semantics: the first one may inspect an array
of chars pointed by s, and the second one may immediately dereference \f(CW\*(C`cp\*(C'\fR
and manipulate \f(CW*cp\fR only (using the return value as, say, a success
indicator).  From Perl one would use these functions in
a completely different manner.
.PP
One conveys this info to \fBxsubpp\fR by replacing \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR before the
argument by \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR means that the argument should be passed to a library
function by its address.  The above two function may be XSUB-ified as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        string_length(s)
\&                char *  s
\&
\&        int
\&        upper_case_char(cp)
\&                char    &cp
.Ve
.PP
For example, consider:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        int
\&        foo(a,b)
\&                char    &a
\&                char *  b
.Ve
.PP
The first Perl argument to this function would be treated as a char and assigned
to the variable a, and its address would be passed into the function foo.
The second Perl argument would be treated as a string pointer and assigned to the
variable b.  The \fIvalue\fR of b would be passed into the function foo.  The
actual call to the function foo that \fBxsubpp\fR generates would look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        foo(&a, b);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxsubpp\fR will parse the following function argument lists identically:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        char    &a
\&        char&a
\&        char    & a
.Ve
.PP
However, to help ease understanding, it is suggested that you place a \*(L"&\*(R"
next to the variable name and away from the variable type), and place a
\&\*(L"*\*(R" near the variable type, but away from the variable name (as in the
call to foo above).  By doing so, it is easy to understand exactly what
will be passed to the C function; it will be whatever is in the \*(L"last
column\*(R".
.PP
You should take great pains to try to pass the function the type of variable
it wants, when possible.  It will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
.SS "The Argument Stack"
.IX Subsection "The Argument Stack"
If we look at any of the C code generated by any of the examples except
example 1, you will notice a number of references to \s-1ST\s0(n), where n is
usually 0.  \*(L"\s-1ST\s0\*(R" is actually a macro that points to the n'th argument
on the argument stack.  \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) is thus the first argument on the stack and
therefore the first argument passed to the \s-1XSUB\s0, \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(1) is the second
argument, and so on.
.PP
When you list the arguments to the \s-1XSUB\s0 in the .xs file, that tells \fBxsubpp\fR
which argument corresponds to which of the argument stack (i.e., the first
one listed is the first argument, and so on).  You invite disaster if you
do not list them in the same order as the function expects them.
.PP
The actual values on the argument stack are pointers to the values passed
in.  When an argument is listed as being an \s-1OUTPUT\s0 value, its corresponding
value on the stack (i.e., \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) if it was the first argument) is changed.
You can verify this by looking at the C code generated for Example 3.
The code for the \fIround()\fR \s-1XSUB\s0 routine contains lines that look like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));
\&        /* Round the contents of the variable arg */
\&        sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);
.Ve
.PP
The arg variable is initially set by taking the value from \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), then is
stored back into \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) at the end of the routine.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to return lists, not just scalars.  This must be
done by manipulating stack values \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(1), etc, in a subtly
different way.  See perlxs for details.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to avoid automatic conversion of Perl function arguments
to C function arguments.  See perlxs for details.  Some people prefer
manual conversion by inspecting \f(CWST(i)\fR even in the cases when automatic
conversion will do, arguing that this makes the logic of an \s-1XSUB\s0 call clearer.
Compare with \*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R" for a similar tradeoff of
a complete separation of \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" and \*(L"workhorse\*(R" parts of an \s-1XSUB\s0.
.PP
While experts may argue about these idioms, a novice to Perl guts may
prefer a way which is as little Perl-guts-specific as possible, meaning
automatic conversion and automatic call generation, as in
\&\*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R".  This approach has the additional
benefit of protecting the \s-1XSUB\s0 writer from future changes to the Perl \s-1API\s0.
.SS "Extending your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Extending your Extension"
Sometimes you might want to provide some extra methods or subroutines
to assist in making the interface between Perl and your extension simpler
or easier to understand.  These routines should live in the .pm file.
Whether they are automatically loaded when the extension itself is loaded
or only loaded when called depends on where in the .pm file the subroutine
definition is placed.  You can also consult AutoLoader for an alternate
way to store and load your extra subroutines.
.SS "Documenting your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Documenting your Extension"
There is absolutely no excuse for not documenting your extension.
Documentation belongs in the .pm file.  This file will be fed to pod2man,
and the embedded documentation will be converted to the manpage format,
then placed in the blib directory.  It will be copied to Perl's
manpage directory when the extension is installed.
.PP
You may intersperse documentation and Perl code within the .pm file.
In fact, if you want to use method autoloading, you must do this,
as the comment inside the .pm file explains.
.PP
See perlpod for more information about the pod format.
.SS "Installing your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Installing your Extension"
Once your extension is complete and passes all its tests, installing it
is quite simple: you simply run \*(L"make install\*(R".  You will either need
to have write permission into the directories where Perl is installed,
or ask your system administrator to run the make for you.
.PP
Alternately, you can specify the exact directory to place the extension's
files by placing a \*(L"PREFIX=/destination/directory\*(R" after the make install.
(or in between the make and install if you have a brain-dead version of make).
This can be very useful if you are building an extension that will eventually
be distributed to multiple systems.  You can then just archive the files in
the destination directory and distribute them to your destination systems.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 5"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 5"
In this example, we'll do some more work with the argument stack.  The
previous examples have all returned only a single value.  We'll now
create an extension that returns an array.
.PP
This extension is very Unix-oriented (struct statfs and the statfs system
call).  If you are not running on a Unix system, you can substitute for
statfs any other function that returns multiple values, you can hard-code
values to be returned to the caller (although this will be a bit harder
to test the error case), or you can simply not do this example.  If you
change the \s-1XSUB\s0, be sure to fix the test cases to match the changes.
.PP
Return to the Mytest directory and add the following code to the end of
Mytest.xs:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        void
\&        statfs(path)

\&                        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVnv(buf.f_bfree)));

\&                        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVnv(buf.f_files)));
\&                        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVnv(buf.f_type)));
\&                } else {

\&                }
.Ve
.PP
You'll also need to add the following code to the top of the .xs file, just
after the include of \*(L"\s-1XSUB\s0.h\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
Also add the following code segment to Mytest.t while incrementing the \*(L"9\*(R"
tests to \*(L"11\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        @a = &Mytest::statfs("/blech");
\&        ok( scalar(@a) == 1 && $a[0] == 2 );
\&        @a = &Mytest::statfs("/");
\&        is( scalar(@a), 7 );
.Ve
.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
This example added quite a few new concepts.  We'll take them one at a time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1INIT:\s0 directive contains code that will be placed immediately after
the argument stack is decoded.  C does not allow variable declarations at
arbitrary locations inside a function,
so this is usually the best way to declare local variables needed by the \s-1XSUB\s0.
(Alternatively, one could put the whole \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR section into braces, and
put these declarations on top.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
This routine also returns a different number of arguments depending on the
success or failure of the call to statfs.  If there is an error, the error
number is returned as a single-element array.  If the call is successful,
then a 7\-element array is returned.  Since only one argument is passed into
this function, we need room on the stack to hold the 7 values which may be
returned.
.Sp
We do this by using the \s-1PPCODE:\s0 directive, rather than the \s-1CODE:\s0 directive.
This tells \fBxsubpp\fR that we will be managing the return values that will be
put on the argument stack by ourselves.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When we want to place values to be returned to the caller onto the stack,
we use the series of macros that begin with \*(L"\s-1XPUSH\s0\*(R".  There are five
different versions, for placing integers, unsigned integers, doubles,
strings, and Perl scalars on the stack.  In our example, we placed a
Perl scalar onto the stack.  (In fact this is the only macro which
can be used to return multiple values.)
.Sp
The XPUSH* macros will automatically extend the return stack to prevent
it from being overrun.  You push values onto the stack in the order you
want them seen by the calling program.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The values pushed onto the return stack of the \s-1XSUB\s0 are actually mortal \s-1SV\s0's.
They are made mortal so that once the values are copied by the calling
program, the \s-1SV\s0's that held the returned values can be deallocated.
If they were not mortal, then they would continue to exist after the \s-1XSUB\s0
routine returned, but would not be accessible.  This is a memory leak.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If we were interested in performance, not in code compactness, in the success
branch we would not use \f(CW\*(C`XPUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, but \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, and would
pre-extend the stack before pushing the return values:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXTEND(SP, 7);
.Ve
.Sp
The tradeoff is that one needs to calculate the number of return values
in advance (though overextending the stack will not typically hurt
anything but memory consumption).
.Sp
Similarly, in the failure branch we could use \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR \fIwithout\fR extending
the stack: the Perl function reference comes to an \s-1XSUB\s0 on the stack, thus
the stack is \fIalways\fR large enough to take one return value.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE\s0 6"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 6"
In this example, we will accept a reference to an array as an input
parameter, and return a reference to an array of hashes.  This will
demonstrate manipulation of complex Perl data types from an \s-1XSUB\s0.
.PP
This extension is somewhat contrived.  It is based on the code in
the previous example.  It calls the statfs function multiple times,
accepting a reference to an array of filenames as input, and returning
a reference to an array of hashes containing the data for each of the
filesystems.
.PP
Return to the Mytest directory and add the following code to the end of
Mytest.xs:

.Ve
.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
There are a number of new concepts introduced here, described below:
.IP "\(bu" 4
This function does not use a typemap.  Instead, we declare it as accepting
one SV* (scalar) parameter, and returning an SV* value, and we take care of
populating these scalars within the code.  Because we are only returning
one value, we don't need a \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR directive \- instead, we use \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR directives.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When dealing with references, it is important to handle them with caution.
The \f(CW\*(C`INIT:\*(C'\fR block first calls SvGETMAGIC(paths), in case
paths is a tied variable.  Then it checks that \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR returns
true, which indicates that paths is a valid reference.  (Simply
checking \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR won't trigger \s-1FETCH\s0 on a tied variable.)  It
then verifies that the object referenced by paths is an array, using \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR
to dereference paths, and \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR to discover its type.  As an added test,
it checks that the array referenced by paths is non-empty, using the \f(CW\*(C`av_len\*(C'\fR
function (which returns \-1 if the array is empty).  The \s-1XSRETURN_UNDEF\s0 macro
is used to abort the \s-1XSUB\s0 and return the undefined value whenever all three of
these conditions are not met.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We manipulate several arrays in this \s-1XSUB\s0.  Note that an array is represented
internally by an AV* pointer.  The functions and macros for manipulating
arrays are similar to the functions in Perl: \f(CW\*(C`av_len\*(C'\fR returns the highest
index in an AV*, much like $#array; \f(CW\*(C`av_fetch\*(C'\fR fetches a single scalar value
from an array, given its index; \f(CW\*(C`av_push\*(C'\fR pushes a scalar value onto the
end of the array, automatically extending the array as necessary.
.Sp
Specifically, we read pathnames one at a time from the input array, and
store the results in an output array (results) in the same order.  If
statfs fails, the element pushed onto the return array is the value of
errno after the failure.  If statfs succeeds, though, the value pushed
onto the return array is a reference to a hash containing some of the
information in the statfs structure.
.Sp
As with the return stack, it would be possible (and a small performance win)
to pre-extend the return array before pushing data into it, since we know
how many elements we will return:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        av_extend(results, numpaths);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
We are performing only one hash operation in this function, which is storing
a new scalar under a key using \f(CW\*(C`hv_store\*(C'\fR.  A hash is represented by an HV*
pointer.  Like arrays, the functions for manipulating hashes from an \s-1XSUB\s0
mirror the functionality available from Perl.  See perlguts and perlapi
for details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To create a reference, we use the \f(CW\*(C`newRV\*(C'\fR function.  Note that you can
cast an AV* or an HV* to type SV* in this case (and many others).  This
allows you to take references to arrays, hashes and scalars with the same
function.  Conversely, the \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR function always returns an SV*, which may
need to be cast to the appropriate type if it is something other than a
scalar (check with \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
At this point, xsubpp is doing very little work \- the differences between
Mytest.xs and Mytest.c are minimal.

\&                FILE *          stream
.Ve
.PP
The real work is done in the standard typemap.
.PP
\&\fBBut\fR you loose all the fine stuff done by the perlio layers. This
calls the stdio function \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, which knows nothing about them.
.PP
The standard typemap offers three variants of PerlIO *:
\&\f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR (T_IN), \f(CW\*(C`InOutStream\*(C'\fR (T_INOUT) and \f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR
(T_OUT). A bare \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR is considered a T_INOUT. If it matters
in your code (see below for why it might) #define or typedef
one of the specific names and use that as the argument or result
type in your \s-1XS\s0 file.
.PP
The standard typemap does not contain PerlIO * before perl 5.7,
but it has the three stream variants. Using a PerlIO * directly
is not backwards compatible unless you provide your own typemap.
.PP
For streams coming \fIfrom\fR perl the main difference is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR will get the output PerlIO * \- which may make
a difference on a socket. Like in our example...
.PP
For streams being handed \fIto\fR perl a new file handle is created
(i.e. a reference to a new glob) and associated with the PerlIO *
provided. If the read/write state of the PerlIO * is not correct then you
may get errors or warnings from when the file handle is used.
So if you opened the PerlIO * as \*(L"w\*(R" it should really be an
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR if open as \*(L"r\*(R" it should be an \f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Now, suppose you want to use perlio layers in your \s-1XS\s0. We'll use the
perlio \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR function as an example.
.PP
In the C part of the \s-1XS\s0 file (above the first \s-1MODULE\s0 line) you
have
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        #define OutputStream    PerlIO *
\&    or
\&        typedef PerlIO *        OutputStream;

And this is the \s-1XS\s0 code:
.PP
.Vb 8

We have to use a \f(CW\*(C`CODE\*(C'\fR section because \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR has the arguments
reversed compared to \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, and we want to keep the arguments the same.
.PP
Wanting to explore this thoroughly, we want to use the stdio \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR
on a PerlIO *. This means we have to ask the perlio system for a stdio
\&\f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 10

\&        perliofputs(s, stream)

\&                } else {

\&                }
\&        OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Note: \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will search the layers for a stdio
layer. If it can't find one, it will call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR to
generate a new stdio \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. Please only call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR if
you want a \fInew\fR \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. It will generate one on each call and push a
new stdio layer. So don't call it repeatedly on the same
file. \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will retrieve the stdio layer once it has been
generated by \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This applies to the perlio system only. For versions before 5.7,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR.

As mentioned at the top of this document, if you are having problems with
these example extensions, you might see if any of these help you.

In versions of 5.002 prior to the gamma version, the test script in Example
1 will not function properly.  You need to change the \*(L"use lib\*(R" line to
read:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        use lib \*(Aq./blib\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
In versions of 5.002 prior to version 5.002b1h, the test.pl file was not
automatically created by h2xs.  This means that you cannot say \*(L"make test\*(R"
to run the test script.  You will need to add the following line before the
\&\*(L"use extension\*(R" statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        use lib \*(Aq./blib\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
In versions 5.000 and 5.001, instead of using the above line, you will need
to use the following line:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib") }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
This document assumes that the executable named \*(L"perl\*(R" is Perl version 5.
Some systems may have installed Perl version 5 as \*(L"perl5\*(R".

.SH "NAME"
perlxstut \- Tutorial for writing XSUBs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This tutorial will educate the reader on the steps involved in creating
a Perl extension.  The reader is assumed to have access to perlguts,
perlapi and perlxs.
.PP
This tutorial starts with very simple examples and becomes more complex,
with each new example adding new features.  Certain concepts may not be
completely explained until later in the tutorial in order to slowly ease
the reader into building extensions.
.PP
This tutorial was written from a Unix point of view.  Where I know them
to be otherwise different for other platforms (e.g. Win32), I will list
them.  If you find something that was missed, please let me know.
.SH "SPECIAL NOTES"
.IX Header "SPECIAL NOTES"
.SS "make"
.IX Subsection "make"
This tutorial assumes that the make program that Perl is configured to
use is called \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR.  Instead of running \*(L"make\*(R" in the examples that
follow, you may have to substitute whatever make program Perl has been
configured to use.  Running \fBperl \-V:make\fR should tell you what it is.
.SS "Version caveat"
.IX Subsection "Version caveat"
When writing a Perl extension for general consumption, one should expect that
the extension will be used with versions of Perl different from the
version available on your machine.  Since you are reading this document,
the version of Perl on your machine is probably 5.005 or later, but the users
of your extension may have more ancient versions.
.PP
To understand what kinds of incompatibilities one may expect, and in the rare
case that the version of Perl on your machine is older than this document,
see the section on \*(L"Troubleshooting these Examples\*(R" for more information.
.PP
If your extension uses some features of Perl which are not available on older
releases of Perl, your users would appreciate an early meaningful warning.
You would probably put this information into the \fI\s-1README\s0\fR file, but nowadays
installation of extensions may be performed automatically, guided by \fI\s-1CPAN\s0.pm\fR
module or other tools.
.PP
In MakeMaker-based installations, \fIMakefile.PL\fR provides the earliest
opportunity to perform version checks.  One can put something like this
in \fIMakefile.PL\fR for this purpose:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    eval { require 5.007 }
\&        or die <<EOD;
\&    ############

.SS "Dynamic Loading versus Static Loading"
.IX Subsection "Dynamic Loading versus Static Loading"
It is commonly thought that if a system does not have the capability to
dynamically load a library, you cannot build XSUBs.  This is incorrect.
You \fIcan\fR build them, but you must link the XSUBs subroutines with the
rest of Perl, creating a new executable.  This situation is similar to
Perl 4.
.PP
This tutorial can still be used on such a system.  The \s-1XSUB\s0 build mechanism
will check the system and build a dynamically-loadable library if possible,
or else a static library and then, optionally, a new statically-linked
executable with that static library linked in.
.PP
Should you wish to build a statically-linked executable on a system which
can dynamically load libraries, you may, in all the following examples,
where the command "\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR\*(L" with no arguments is executed, run the command
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make perl\*(C'\fR" instead.
.PP
If you have generated such a statically-linked executable by choice, then
instead of saying "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L", you should say \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test_static\*(C'\fR\*(L".
On systems that cannot build dynamically-loadable libraries at all, simply
saying \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" is sufficient.
.SH "TUTORIAL"
.IX Header "TUTORIAL"
Now let's go on with the show!
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 1\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 1"
Our first extension will be very simple.  When we call the routine in the
extension, it will print out a well-known message and return.
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`h2xs \-A \-n Mytest\*(C'\fR".  This creates a directory named Mytest,
possibly under ext/ if that directory exists in the current working
directory.  Several files will be created under the Mytest dir, including
\&\s-1MANIFEST,\s0 Makefile.PL, lib/Mytest.pm, Mytest.xs, t/Mytest.t, and Changes.
.PP
The \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file contains the names of all the files just created in the
Mytest directory.
.PP
The file Makefile.PL should look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&    # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
\&    # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
\&    WriteMakefile(
\&        NAME         => \*(AqMytest\*(Aq,
\&        VERSION_FROM => \*(AqMytest.pm\*(Aq, # finds $VERSION
\&        LIBS         => [\*(Aq\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
\&        DEFINE       => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-DHAVE_SOMETHING\*(Aq
\&        INC          => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-I/usr/include/other\*(Aq
\&    );
.Ve
.PP
The file Mytest.pm should start with something like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package Mytest;
\&
\&    use 5.008008;
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&
\&    require Exporter;
\&
\&    our @ISA = qw(Exporter);
\&    our %EXPORT_TAGS = ( \*(Aqall\*(Aq => [ qw(
\&
\&    ) ] );
\&
\&    our @EXPORT_OK = ( @{ $EXPORT_TAGS{\*(Aqall\*(Aq} } );
\&
\&    our @EXPORT = qw(
\&
\&    );
\&
\&    our $VERSION = \*(Aq0.01\*(Aq;
\&
\&    require XSLoader;
\&    XSLoader::load(\*(AqMytest\*(Aq, $VERSION);
\&
\&    # Preloaded methods go here.
\&
\&    1;
\&    _\|_END_\|_
\&    # Below is the stub of documentation for your module. You better edit it!
.Ve
.PP
The rest of the .pm file contains sample code for providing documentation for
the extension.
.PP
Finally, the Mytest.xs file should look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    #include "EXTERN.h"
\&    #include "perl.h"
\&    #include "XSUB.h"
\&
\&    #include "ppport.h"
\&
\&    MODULE = Mytest             PACKAGE = Mytest
.Ve
.PP
Let's edit the .xs file by adding this to the end of the file:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    void
\&    hello()
\&        CODE:
\&            printf("Hello, world!\en");
.Ve
.PP
It is okay for the lines starting at the \*(L"\s-1CODE:\*(R"\s0 line to not be indented.
However, for readability purposes, it is suggested that you indent \s-1CODE:\s0
one level and the lines following one more level.
.PP
Now we'll run "\f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR".  This will create a real Makefile,
which make needs.  Its output looks something like:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    % perl Makefile.PL
\&    Checking if your kit is complete...
\&    Looks good
\&    Writing Makefile for Mytest
\&    %
.Ve
.PP
Now, running make will produce output that looks something like this (some
long lines have been shortened for clarity and some extraneous lines have
been deleted):
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    % make
\&    cp lib/Mytest.pm blib/lib/Mytest.pm
\&    perl xsubpp  \-typemap typemap  Mytest.xs > Mytest.xsc && mv Mytest.xsc Mytest.c
\&    Please specify prototyping behavior for Mytest.xs (see perlxs manual)
\&    cc \-c     Mytest.c
\&    Running Mkbootstrap for Mytest ()
\&    chmod 644 Mytest.bs
\&    rm \-f blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so
\&    cc  \-shared \-L/usr/local/lib Mytest.o  \-o blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so   \e
\&                \e
\&
\&    chmod 755 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so
\&    cp Mytest.bs blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs
\&    chmod 644 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs
\&    Manifying blib/man3/Mytest.3pm
\&    %
.Ve
.PP
You can safely ignore the line about \*(L"prototyping behavior\*(R" \- it is
explained in \*(L"The \s-1PROTOTYPES:\s0 Keyword\*(R" in perlxs.
.PP
Perl has its own special way of easily writing test scripts, but for this
example only, we'll create our own test script.  Create a file called hello
that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #! /opt/perl5/bin/perl
\&
\&    use ExtUtils::testlib;
\&
\&    use Mytest;
\&
\&    Mytest::hello();
.Ve
.PP
Now we make the script executable (\f(CW\*(C`chmod +x hello\*(C'\fR), run the script
and we should see the following output:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % ./hello
\&    Hello, world!
\&    %
.Ve
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 2\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 2"
Now let's add to our extension a subroutine that will take a single numeric
argument as input and return 1 if the number is even or 0 if the number
is odd.
.PP
Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    int
\&    is_even(input)
\&            int input
\&        CODE:
\&            RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
\&        OUTPUT:
\&            RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
There does not need to be whitespace at the start of the "\f(CW\*(C`int input\*(C'\fR\*(L"
line, but it is useful for improving readability.  Placing a semi-colon at
the end of that line is also optional.  Any amount and kind of whitespace
may be placed between the \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR\*(L" and \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR".
.PP
Now re-run make to rebuild our new shared library.
.PP
Now perform the same steps as before, generating a Makefile from the
Makefile.PL file, and running make.
.PP
In order to test that our extension works, we now need to look at the
file Mytest.t.  This file is set up to imitate the same kind of testing
structure that Perl itself has.  Within the test script, you perform a
number of tests to confirm the behavior of the extension, printing \*(L"ok\*(R"

.IX Subsection "What has gone on?"
The program h2xs is the starting point for creating extensions.  In later
examples we'll see how we can use h2xs to read header files and generate
templates to connect to C routines.
.PP
h2xs creates a number of files in the extension directory.  The file
Makefile.PL is a perl script which will generate a true Makefile to build
the extension.  We'll take a closer look at it later.
.PP
The .pm and .xs files contain the meat of the extension.  The .xs file holds
the C routines that make up the extension.  The .pm file contains routines
that tell Perl how to load your extension.
.PP
Generating the Makefile and running \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR created a directory called blib
(which stands for \*(L"build library\*(R") in the current working directory.  This
directory will contain the shared library that we will build.  Once we have
tested it, we can install it into its final location.
.PP
Invoking the test script via "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" did something very important.
It invoked perl with all those \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR arguments so that it could find the
various files that are part of the extension.  It is \fIvery\fR important that
while you are still testing extensions that you use "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L".  If you
try to run the test script all by itself, you will get a fatal error.
Another reason it is important to use \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L" to run your test
script is that if you are testing an upgrade to an already-existing version,
using \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" ensures that you will test your new extension, not the
already-existing version.
.PP
When Perl sees a \f(CW\*(C`use extension;\*(C'\fR, it searches for a file with the same name
as the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR'd extension that has a .pm suffix.  If that file cannot be found,
Perl dies with a fatal error.  The default search path is contained in the
\&\f(CW@INC\fR array.
.PP
In our case, Mytest.pm tells perl that it will need the Exporter and Dynamic
Loader extensions.  It then sets the \f(CW@ISA\fR and \f(CW@EXPORT\fR arrays and the
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR scalar; finally it tells perl to bootstrap the module.  Perl
will call its dynamic loader routine (if there is one) and load the shared
library.
.PP
The two arrays \f(CW@ISA\fR and \f(CW@EXPORT\fR are very important.  The \f(CW@ISA\fR
array contains a list of other packages in which to search for methods (or
subroutines) that do not exist in the current package.  This is usually
only important for object-oriented extensions (which we will talk about
much later), and so usually doesn't need to be modified.
.PP
The \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array tells Perl which of the extension's variables and
subroutines should be placed into the calling package's namespace.  Because
you don't know if the user has already used your variable and subroutine
names, it's vitally important to carefully select what to export.  Do \fInot\fR
export method or variable names \fIby default\fR without a good reason.
.PP
As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object-oriented then don't
export anything.  If it's just a collection of functions and variables, then
you can export them via another array, called \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR.  This array
does not automatically place its subroutine and variable names into the
namespace unless the user specifically requests that this be done.
.PP
See perlmod for more information.
.PP
The \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable is used to ensure that the .pm file and the shared
library are \*(L"in sync\*(R" with each other.  Any time you make changes to
the .pm or .xs files, you should increment the value of this variable.
.SS "Writing good test scripts"
.IX Subsection "Writing good test scripts"
The importance of writing good test scripts cannot be over-emphasized.  You
should closely follow the \*(L"ok/not ok\*(R" style that Perl itself uses, so that
it is very easy and unambiguous to determine the outcome of each test case.
When you find and fix a bug, make sure you add a test case for it.
.PP
By running "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR\*(L", you ensure that your Mytest.t script runs and uses
the correct version of your extension.  If you have many test cases,
save your test files in the \*(R"t\*(L" directory and use the suffix \*(R".t\*(L".
When you run \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR", all of these test files will be executed.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 3\s0"

Our third extension will take one argument as its input, round off that

.Ve
.PP
Generate the Makefile and run make.  Change the test number in Mytest.t to
\&\*(L"9\*(R" and add the following tests:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        $i = \-1.5; &Mytest::round($i); is( $i, \-2.0 );
\&        $i = \-1.1; &Mytest::round($i); is( $i, \-1.0 );
\&        $i = 0.0; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  0.0 );
\&        $i = 0.5; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  1.0 );
\&        $i = 1.2; &Mytest::round($i);  is( $i,  1.0 );
.Ve
.PP
Running "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" should now print out that all nine tests are okay.
.PP
Notice that in these new test cases, the argument passed to round was a
scalar variable.  You might be wondering if you can round a constant or
literal.  To see what happens, temporarily add the following line to Mytest.t:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        &Mytest::round(3);
.Ve
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and notice that Perl dies with a fatal error.  Perl won't
let you change the value of constants!
.SS "What's new here?"

.IP "\(bu" 4
We've made some changes to Makefile.PL.  In this case, we've specified an
extra library to be linked into the extension's shared library, the math
library libm in this case.  We'll talk later about how to write XSUBs that
can call every routine in a library.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The value of the function is not being passed back as the function's return
value, but by changing the value of the variable that was passed into the
function.  You might have guessed that when you saw that the return value
of round is of type \*(L"void\*(R".
.SS "Input and Output Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Input and Output Parameters"
You specify the parameters that will be passed into the \s-1XSUB\s0 on the line(s)
after you declare the function's return value and name.  Each input parameter
line starts with optional whitespace, and may have an optional terminating
semicolon.
.PP
The list of output parameters occurs at the very end of the function, just
after the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 directive.  The use of \s-1RETVAL\s0 tells Perl that you
wish to send this value back as the return value of the \s-1XSUB\s0 function.  In
Example 3, we wanted the \*(L"return value\*(R" placed in the original variable
which we passed in, so we listed it (and not \s-1RETVAL\s0) in the \s-1OUTPUT:\s0 section.
.SS "The \s-1XSUBPP\s0 Program"
.IX Subsection "The XSUBPP Program"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program takes the \s-1XS\s0 code in the .xs file and translates it into
C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code created makes
heavy use of the C functions within Perl.
.SS "The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 file"
.IX Subsection "The TYPEMAP file"
The \fBxsubpp\fR program uses rules to convert from Perl's data types (scalar,
array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char, etc.).  These rules are stored
in the typemap file ($PERLLIB/ExtUtils/typemap).  There's a brief discussion
below, but all the nitty-gritty details can be found in perlxstypemap.
If you have a new-enough version of perl (5.16 and up) or an upgraded
\&\s-1XS\s0 compiler (\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::ParseXS\*(C'\fR 3.13_01 or better), then you can inline
typemaps in your \s-1XS\s0 instead of writing separate files.
Either way, this typemap thing is split into three parts:
.PP
The first section maps various C data types to a name, which corresponds
somewhat with the various Perl types.  The second section contains C code
which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle input parameters.  The third section contains
C code which \fBxsubpp\fR uses to handle output parameters.
.PP
Let's take a look at a portion of the .c file created for our extension.
The file name is Mytest.c:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        XS(XS_Mytest_round)
\&        {
\&            dXSARGS;
\&            if (items != 1)
\&                Perl_croak(aTHX_ "Usage: Mytest::round(arg)");
\&            PERL_UNUSED_VAR(cv); /* \-W */
\&            {
\&                double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));      /* XXXXX */
\&                if (arg > 0.0) {
\&                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
\&                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
\&                        arg = ceil(arg \- 0.5);
\&                } else {
\&                        arg = 0.0;
\&                }
\&                sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);   /* XXXXX */
\&                SvSETMAGIC(ST(0));
\&            }
\&            XSRETURN_EMPTY;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Notice the two lines commented with \*(L"\s-1XXXXX\*(R". \s0 If you check the first part
of the typemap file (or section), you'll see that doubles are of type
T_DOUBLE.  In the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of the typemap, an argument that is T_DOUBLE
is assigned to the variable arg by calling the routine SvNV on something,
then casting it to double, then assigned to the variable arg.  Similarly,
in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section, once arg has its final value, it is passed to the
sv_setnv function to be passed back to the calling subroutine.  These two
functions are explained in perlguts; we'll talk more later about what
that \*(L"\s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0)\*(R" means in the section on the argument stack.
.SS "Warning about Output Arguments"
.IX Subsection "Warning about Output Arguments"
In general, it's not a good idea to write extensions that modify their input
parameters, as in Example 3.  Instead, you should probably return multiple
values in an array and let the caller handle them (we'll do this in a later
example).  However, in order to better accommodate calling pre-existing C
routines, which often do modify their input parameters, this behavior is
tolerated.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 4\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 4"
In this example, we'll now begin to write XSUBs that will interact with
pre-defined C libraries.  To begin with, we will build a small library of
our own, then let h2xs write our .pm and .xs files for us.
.PP
Create a new directory called Mytest2 at the same level as the directory
Mytest.  In the Mytest2 directory, create another directory called mylib,
and cd into that directory.
.PP
Here we'll create some files that will generate a test library.  These will
include a C source file and a header file.  We'll also create a Makefile.PL
in this directory.  Then we'll make sure that running make at the Mytest2
level will automatically run this Makefile.PL file and the resulting Makefile.
.PP
In the mylib directory, create a file mylib.h that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define TESTVAL 4
\&
\&        extern double   foo(int, long, const char*);
.Ve
.PP
Also create a file mylib.c that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        #include <stdlib.h>
\&        #include "./mylib.h"
\&
\&        double
\&        foo(int a, long b, const char *c)
\&        {
\&                return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
And finally create a file Makefile.PL that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&        $Verbose = 1;
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            NAME   => \*(AqMytest2::mylib\*(Aq,
\&            SKIP   => [qw(all static static_lib dynamic dynamic_lib)],
\&            clean  => {\*(AqFILES\*(Aq => \*(Aqlibmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq},
\&        );
\&
\&
\&        sub MY::top_targets {
\&                \*(Aq
\&        all :: static
\&
\&        pure_all :: static
\&
\&        static ::       libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        libmylib$(LIB_EXT): $(O_FILES)
\&                $(AR) cr libmylib$(LIB_EXT) $(O_FILES)
\&                $(RANLIB) libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
\&
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Make sure you use a tab and not spaces on the lines beginning with \*(L"$(\s-1AR\s0)\*(R"
and \*(L"$(\s-1RANLIB\s0)\*(R".  Make will not function properly if you use spaces.
It has also been reported that the \*(L"cr\*(R" argument to $(\s-1AR\s0) is unnecessary
on Win32 systems.
.PP
We will now create the main top-level Mytest2 files.  Change to the directory
above Mytest2 and run the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        % h2xs \-O \-n Mytest2 ./Mytest2/mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
This will print out a warning about overwriting Mytest2, but that's okay.
Our files are stored in Mytest2/mylib, and will be untouched.
.PP
The normal Makefile.PL that h2xs generates doesn't know about the mylib
directory.  We need to tell it that there is a subdirectory and that we
will be generating a library in it.  Let's add the argument \s-1MYEXTLIB\s0 to
the WriteMakefile call so that it looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        WriteMakefile(
\&            \*(AqNAME\*(Aq      => \*(AqMytest2\*(Aq,
\&            \*(AqVERSION_FROM\*(Aq => \*(AqMytest2.pm\*(Aq, # finds $VERSION
\&            \*(AqLIBS\*(Aq      => [\*(Aq\*(Aq],   # e.g., \*(Aq\-lm\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqDEFINE\*(Aq    => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-DHAVE_SOMETHING\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqINC\*(Aq       => \*(Aq\*(Aq,     # e.g., \*(Aq\-I/usr/include/other\*(Aq
\&            \*(AqMYEXTLIB\*(Aq => \*(Aqmylib/libmylib$(LIB_EXT)\*(Aq,
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
and then at the end add a subroutine (which will override the pre-existing
subroutine).  Remember to use a tab character to indent the line beginning
with \*(L"cd\*(R"!
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        sub MY::postamble {
\&        \*(Aq
\&        $(MYEXTLIB): mylib/Makefile
\&                cd mylib && $(MAKE) $(PASSTHRU)
\&        \*(Aq;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
Let's also fix the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file so that it accurately reflects the contents
of our extension.  The single line that says \*(L"mylib\*(R" should be replaced by
the following three lines:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        mylib/Makefile.PL
\&        mylib/mylib.c
\&        mylib/mylib.h
.Ve
.PP
To keep our namespace nice and unpolluted, edit the .pm file and change
the variable \f(CW@EXPORT\fR to \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR.  Finally, in the
\&.xs file, edit the #include line to read:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #include "mylib/mylib.h"
.Ve
.PP
And also add the following function definition to the end of the .xs file:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Now we also need to create a typemap because the default Perl doesn't
currently support the \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR type.  Include a new \s-1TYPEMAP\s0
section in your \s-1XS\s0 code before the above function:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        TYPEMAP: <<END;
\&        const char *    T_PV
\&        END
.Ve
.PP
Now run perl on the top-level Makefile.PL.  Notice that it also created a
Makefile in the mylib directory.  Run make and watch that it does cd into
the mylib directory and run make in there as well.
.PP
Now edit the Mytest2.t script and change the number of tests to \*(L"4\*(R",
and add the following lines to the end of the script:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "Hello, world!"), 7 );
\&        is( &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "0.0"), 7 );
\&        ok( abs(&Mytest2::foo(0, 0, "\-3.4") \- 0.6) <= 0.01 );
.Ve
.PP
(When dealing with floating-point comparisons, it is best to not check for
equality, but rather that the difference between the expected and actual
result is below a certain amount (called epsilon) which is 0.01 in this case)
.PP
Run "\f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR" and all should be well. There are some warnings on missing tests
for the Mytest2::mylib extension, but you can ignore them.
.SS "What has happened here?"
.IX Subsection "What has happened here?"
Unlike previous examples, we've now run h2xs on a real include file.  This
has caused some extra goodies to appear in both the .pm and .xs files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In the .xs file, there's now a #include directive with the absolute path to
the mylib.h header file.  We changed this to a relative path so that we
could move the extension directory if we wanted to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There's now some new C code that's been added to the .xs file.  The purpose
of the \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine is to make the values that are #define'd in the
header file accessible by the Perl script (by calling either \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW&Mytest2::TESTVAL\fR).  There's also some \s-1XS\s0 code to allow calls to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR routine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The .pm file originally exported the name \f(CW\*(C`TESTVAL\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.
This could lead to name clashes.  A good rule of thumb is that if the #define
is only going to be used by the C routines themselves, and not by the user,
they should be removed from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array.  Alternately, if you don't
mind using the \*(L"fully qualified name\*(R" of a variable, you could move most
or all of the items from the \f(CW@EXPORT\fR array into the \f(CW@EXPORT_OK\fR array.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If our include file had contained #include directives, these would not have
been processed by h2xs.  There is no good solution to this right now.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We've also told Perl about the library that we built in the mylib
subdirectory.  That required only the addition of the \f(CW\*(C`MYEXTLIB\*(C'\fR variable
to the WriteMakefile call and the replacement of the postamble subroutine
to cd into the subdirectory and run make.  The Makefile.PL for the
library is a bit more complicated, but not excessively so.  Again we
replaced the postamble subroutine to insert our own code.  This code
simply specified that the library to be created here was a static archive
library (as opposed to a dynamically loadable library) and provided the
commands to build it.
.SS "Anatomy of .xs file"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of .xs file"
The .xs file of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 4\*(R"\s0 contained some new elements.  To understand
the meaning of these elements, pay attention to the line which reads
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        MODULE = Mytest2                PACKAGE = Mytest2
.Ve
.PP
Anything before this line is plain C code which describes which headers
to include, and defines some convenience functions.  No translations are
performed on this part, apart from having embedded \s-1POD\s0 documentation
skipped over (see perlpod) it goes into the generated output C file as is.
.PP
Anything after this line is the description of \s-1XSUB\s0 functions.
These descriptions are translated by \fBxsubpp\fR into C code which
implements these functions using Perl calling conventions, and which
makes these functions visible from Perl interpreter.
.PP
Pay a special attention to the function \f(CW\*(C`constant\*(C'\fR.  This name appears
twice in the generated .xs file: once in the first part, as a static C
function, then another time in the second part, when an \s-1XSUB\s0 interface to
this static C function is defined.
.PP
This is quite typical for .xs files: usually the .xs file provides
an interface to an existing C function.  Then this C function is defined
somewhere (either in an external library, or in the first part of .xs file),
and a Perl interface to this function (i.e. \*(L"Perl glue\*(R") is described in the
second part of .xs file.  The situation in \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 1\*(R"\s0, \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0,
and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 3\*(R"\s0, when all the work is done inside the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R", is
somewhat of an exception rather than the rule.

Note that in contrast with \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 1\*(R"\s0, \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 3\*(R"\s0,
this description does not contain the actual \fIcode\fR for what is done
during a call to Perl function \fIfoo()\fR.  To understand what is going
on here, one can add a \s-1CODE\s0 section to this \s-1XSUB:\s0
.PP
.Vb 9
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a

\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
However, these two XSUBs provide almost identical generated C code: \fBxsubpp\fR
compiler is smart enough to figure out the \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR section from the first
two lines of the description of \s-1XSUB. \s0 What about \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section?  In
fact, that is absolutely the same!  The \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section can be removed
as well, \fIas far as \f(CI\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fI section or \f(CI\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fI section\fR is not
specified: \fBxsubpp\fR can see that it needs to generate a function call
section, and will autogenerate the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section too.  Thus one can
shortcut the \s-1XSUB\s0 to become:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        double
\&        foo(a,b,c)
\&                int             a
\&                long            b
\&                const char *    c
.Ve
.PP
Can we do the same with an \s-1XSUB\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
\&            CODE:
\&                RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
\&            OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
of \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE 2\*(R"\s0?  To do this, one needs to define a C function \f(CW\*(C`int
is_even(int input)\*(C'\fR.  As we saw in \*(L"Anatomy of .xs file\*(R", a proper place
for this definition is in the first part of .xs file.  In fact a C function
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        int
\&        is_even(int arg)
\&        {
\&                return (arg % 2 == 0);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
is probably overkill for this.  Something as simple as a \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR will
do too:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #define is_even(arg)    ((arg) % 2 == 0)
.Ve
.PP
After having this in the first part of .xs file, the \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" part becomes
as simple as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        is_even(input)
\&                int     input
.Ve
.PP
This technique of separation of the glue part from the workhorse part has
obvious tradeoffs: if you want to change a Perl interface, you need to
change two places in your code.  However, it removes a lot of clutter,
and makes the workhorse part independent from idiosyncrasies of Perl calling
convention.  (In fact, there is nothing Perl-specific in the above description,
a different version of \fBxsubpp\fR might have translated this to \s-1TCL\s0 glue or
Python glue as well.)
.SS "More about \s-1XSUB\s0 arguments"
.IX Subsection "More about XSUB arguments"
With the completion of Example 4, we now have an easy way to simulate some
real-life libraries whose interfaces may not be the cleanest in the world.
We shall now continue with a discussion of the arguments passed to the
\&\fBxsubpp\fR compiler.
.PP
When you specify arguments to routines in the .xs file, you are really
passing three pieces of information for each argument listed.  The first
piece is the order of that argument relative to the others (first, second,
etc).  The second is the type of argument, and consists of the type
declaration of the argument (e.g., int, char*, etc).  The third piece is
the calling convention for the argument in the call to the library function.
.PP
While Perl passes arguments to functions by reference,
C passes arguments by value; to implement a C function which modifies data
of one of the \*(L"arguments\*(R", the actual argument of this C function would be
a pointer to the data.  Thus two C functions with declarations
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        int string_length(char *s);
\&        int upper_case_char(char *cp);
.Ve
.PP
may have completely different semantics: the first one may inspect an array
of chars pointed by s, and the second one may immediately dereference \f(CW\*(C`cp\*(C'\fR
and manipulate \f(CW*cp\fR only (using the return value as, say, a success
indicator).  From Perl one would use these functions in
a completely different manner.
.PP
One conveys this info to \fBxsubpp\fR by replacing \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR before the
argument by \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR means that the argument should be passed to a library
function by its address.  The above two function may be XSUB-ified as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        int
\&        string_length(s)
\&                char *  s
\&
\&        int
\&        upper_case_char(cp)
\&                char    &cp
.Ve
.PP
For example, consider:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        int
\&        foo(a,b)
\&                char    &a
\&                char *  b
.Ve
.PP
The first Perl argument to this function would be treated as a char and assigned
to the variable a, and its address would be passed into the function foo.
The second Perl argument would be treated as a string pointer and assigned to the
variable b.  The \fIvalue\fR of b would be passed into the function foo.  The
actual call to the function foo that \fBxsubpp\fR generates would look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        foo(&a, b);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxsubpp\fR will parse the following function argument lists identically:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        char    &a
\&        char&a
\&        char    & a
.Ve
.PP
However, to help ease understanding, it is suggested that you place a \*(L"&\*(R"
next to the variable name and away from the variable type), and place a
\&\*(L"*\*(R" near the variable type, but away from the variable name (as in the
call to foo above).  By doing so, it is easy to understand exactly what
will be passed to the C function; it will be whatever is in the \*(L"last
column\*(R".
.PP
You should take great pains to try to pass the function the type of variable
it wants, when possible.  It will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
.SS "The Argument Stack"
.IX Subsection "The Argument Stack"
If we look at any of the C code generated by any of the examples except
example 1, you will notice a number of references to \s-1ST\s0(n), where n is
usually 0.  \*(L"\s-1ST\*(R"\s0 is actually a macro that points to the n'th argument
on the argument stack.  \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) is thus the first argument on the stack and
therefore the first argument passed to the \s-1XSUB, \fIST\s0\fR\|(1) is the second
argument, and so on.
.PP
When you list the arguments to the \s-1XSUB\s0 in the .xs file, that tells \fBxsubpp\fR
which argument corresponds to which of the argument stack (i.e., the first
one listed is the first argument, and so on).  You invite disaster if you
do not list them in the same order as the function expects them.
.PP
The actual values on the argument stack are pointers to the values passed
in.  When an argument is listed as being an \s-1OUTPUT\s0 value, its corresponding
value on the stack (i.e., \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) if it was the first argument) is changed.
You can verify this by looking at the C code generated for Example 3.
The code for the \fIround()\fR \s-1XSUB\s0 routine contains lines that look like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));
\&        /* Round the contents of the variable arg */
\&        sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);
.Ve
.PP
The arg variable is initially set by taking the value from \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), then is
stored back into \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0) at the end of the routine.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to return lists, not just scalars.  This must be
done by manipulating stack values \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(0), \s-1\fIST\s0\fR\|(1), etc, in a subtly
different way.  See perlxs for details.
.PP
XSUBs are also allowed to avoid automatic conversion of Perl function arguments
to C function arguments.  See perlxs for details.  Some people prefer
manual conversion by inspecting \f(CWST(i)\fR even in the cases when automatic
conversion will do, arguing that this makes the logic of an \s-1XSUB\s0 call clearer.
Compare with \*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R" for a similar tradeoff of
a complete separation of \*(L"Perl glue\*(R" and \*(L"workhorse\*(R" parts of an \s-1XSUB.\s0
.PP
While experts may argue about these idioms, a novice to Perl guts may
prefer a way which is as little Perl-guts-specific as possible, meaning
automatic conversion and automatic call generation, as in
\&\*(L"Getting the fat out of XSUBs\*(R".  This approach has the additional
benefit of protecting the \s-1XSUB\s0 writer from future changes to the Perl \s-1API.\s0
.SS "Extending your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Extending your Extension"
Sometimes you might want to provide some extra methods or subroutines
to assist in making the interface between Perl and your extension simpler
or easier to understand.  These routines should live in the .pm file.
Whether they are automatically loaded when the extension itself is loaded
or only loaded when called depends on where in the .pm file the subroutine
definition is placed.  You can also consult AutoLoader for an alternate
way to store and load your extra subroutines.
.SS "Documenting your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Documenting your Extension"
There is absolutely no excuse for not documenting your extension.
Documentation belongs in the .pm file.  This file will be fed to pod2man,
and the embedded documentation will be converted to the manpage format,
then placed in the blib directory.  It will be copied to Perl's
manpage directory when the extension is installed.
.PP
You may intersperse documentation and Perl code within the .pm file.
In fact, if you want to use method autoloading, you must do this,
as the comment inside the .pm file explains.
.PP
See perlpod for more information about the pod format.
.SS "Installing your Extension"
.IX Subsection "Installing your Extension"
Once your extension is complete and passes all its tests, installing it
is quite simple: you simply run \*(L"make install\*(R".  You will either need
to have write permission into the directories where Perl is installed,
or ask your system administrator to run the make for you.
.PP
Alternately, you can specify the exact directory to place the extension's
files by placing a \*(L"PREFIX=/destination/directory\*(R" after the make install.
(or in between the make and install if you have a brain-dead version of make).
This can be very useful if you are building an extension that will eventually
be distributed to multiple systems.  You can then just archive the files in
the destination directory and distribute them to your destination systems.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 5\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 5"
In this example, we'll do some more work with the argument stack.  The
previous examples have all returned only a single value.  We'll now
create an extension that returns an array.
.PP
This extension is very Unix-oriented (struct statfs and the statfs system
call).  If you are not running on a Unix system, you can substitute for
statfs any other function that returns multiple values, you can hard-code
values to be returned to the caller (although this will be a bit harder
to test the error case), or you can simply not do this example.  If you
change the \s-1XSUB,\s0 be sure to fix the test cases to match the changes.
.PP
Return to the Mytest directory and add the following code to the end of
Mytest.xs:

\&        is( scalar(@a), 7 );
.Ve
.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
This example added quite a few new concepts.  We'll take them one at a time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1INIT:\s0 directive contains code that will be placed immediately after
the argument stack is decoded.  C does not allow variable declarations at
arbitrary locations inside a function,
so this is usually the best way to declare local variables needed by the \s-1XSUB.
\&\s0(Alternatively, one could put the whole \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR section into braces, and
put these declarations on top.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
This routine also returns a different number of arguments depending on the
success or failure of the call to statfs.  If there is an error, the error
number is returned as a single-element array.  If the call is successful,
then a 7\-element array is returned.  Since only one argument is passed into
this function, we need room on the stack to hold the 7 values which may be
returned.
.Sp
We do this by using the \s-1PPCODE:\s0 directive, rather than the \s-1CODE:\s0 directive.
This tells \fBxsubpp\fR that we will be managing the return values that will be
put on the argument stack by ourselves.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When we want to place values to be returned to the caller onto the stack,
we use the series of macros that begin with \*(L"\s-1XPUSH\*(R". \s0 There are five
different versions, for placing integers, unsigned integers, doubles,
strings, and Perl scalars on the stack.  In our example, we placed a
Perl scalar onto the stack.  (In fact this is the only macro which
can be used to return multiple values.)
.Sp
The XPUSH* macros will automatically extend the return stack to prevent
it from being overrun.  You push values onto the stack in the order you
want them seen by the calling program.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The values pushed onto the return stack of the \s-1XSUB\s0 are actually mortal \s-1SV\s0's.
They are made mortal so that once the values are copied by the calling
program, the \s-1SV\s0's that held the returned values can be deallocated.
If they were not mortal, then they would continue to exist after the \s-1XSUB\s0
routine returned, but would not be accessible.  This is a memory leak.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If we were interested in performance, not in code compactness, in the success
branch we would not use \f(CW\*(C`XPUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, but \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR macros, and would
pre-extend the stack before pushing the return values:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXTEND(SP, 7);
.Ve
.Sp
The tradeoff is that one needs to calculate the number of return values
in advance (though overextending the stack will not typically hurt
anything but memory consumption).
.Sp
Similarly, in the failure branch we could use \f(CW\*(C`PUSHs\*(C'\fR \fIwithout\fR extending
the stack: the Perl function reference comes to an \s-1XSUB\s0 on the stack, thus
the stack is \fIalways\fR large enough to take one return value.
.SS "\s-1EXAMPLE 6\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXAMPLE 6"
In this example, we will accept a reference to an array as an input
parameter, and return a reference to an array of hashes.  This will
demonstrate manipulation of complex Perl data types from an \s-1XSUB.\s0
.PP
This extension is somewhat contrived.  It is based on the code in
the previous example.  It calls the statfs function multiple times,
accepting a reference to an array of filenames as input, and returning
a reference to an array of hashes containing the data for each of the
filesystems.
.PP
Return to the Mytest directory and add the following code to the end of
Mytest.xs:

.SS "New Things in this Example"
.IX Subsection "New Things in this Example"
There are a number of new concepts introduced here, described below:
.IP "\(bu" 4
This function does not use a typemap.  Instead, we declare it as accepting
one SV* (scalar) parameter, and returning an SV* value, and we take care of
populating these scalars within the code.  Because we are only returning
one value, we don't need a \f(CW\*(C`PPCODE:\*(C'\fR directive \- instead, we use \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR directives.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When dealing with references, it is important to handle them with caution.
The \f(CW\*(C`INIT:\*(C'\fR block first calls SvGETMAGIC(paths), in case
paths is a tied variable.  Then it checks that \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR returns
true, which indicates that paths is a valid reference.  (Simply
checking \f(CW\*(C`SvROK\*(C'\fR won't trigger \s-1FETCH\s0 on a tied variable.)  It
then verifies that the object referenced by paths is an array, using \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR
to dereference paths, and \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR to discover its type.  As an added test,
it checks that the array referenced by paths is non-empty, using the \f(CW\*(C`av_top_index\*(C'\fR
function (which returns \-1 if the array is empty).  The \s-1XSRETURN_UNDEF\s0 macro
is used to abort the \s-1XSUB\s0 and return the undefined value whenever all three of
these conditions are not met.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We manipulate several arrays in this \s-1XSUB. \s0 Note that an array is represented
internally by an AV* pointer.  The functions and macros for manipulating
arrays are similar to the functions in Perl: \f(CW\*(C`av_top_index\*(C'\fR returns the highest
index in an AV*, much like $#array; \f(CW\*(C`av_fetch\*(C'\fR fetches a single scalar value
from an array, given its index; \f(CW\*(C`av_push\*(C'\fR pushes a scalar value onto the
end of the array, automatically extending the array as necessary.
.Sp
Specifically, we read pathnames one at a time from the input array, and
store the results in an output array (results) in the same order.  If
statfs fails, the element pushed onto the return array is the value of
errno after the failure.  If statfs succeeds, though, the value pushed
onto the return array is a reference to a hash containing some of the
information in the statfs structure.
.Sp
As with the return stack, it would be possible (and a small performance win)
to pre-extend the return array before pushing data into it, since we know
how many elements we will return:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        av_extend(results, numpaths);
.Ve

We are performing only one hash operation in this function, which is storing
a new scalar under a key using \f(CW\*(C`hv_store\*(C'\fR.  A hash is represented by an HV*
pointer.  Like arrays, the functions for manipulating hashes from an \s-1XSUB\s0
mirror the functionality available from Perl.  See perlguts and perlapi
for details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To create a reference, we use the \f(CW\*(C`newRV\*(C'\fR function.  Note that you can
cast an AV* or an HV* to type SV* in this case (and many others).  This
allows you to take references to arrays, hashes and scalars with the same
function.  Conversely, the \f(CW\*(C`SvRV\*(C'\fR function always returns an SV*, which may
need to be cast to the appropriate type if it is something other than a
scalar (check with \f(CW\*(C`SvTYPE\*(C'\fR).

At this point, xsubpp is doing very little work \- the differences between
Mytest.xs and Mytest.c are minimal.

You would think passing files to an \s-1XS\s0 is difficult, with all the
typeglobs and stuff. Well, it isn't.
.PP
Suppose that for some strange reason we need a wrapper around the
standard C library function \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR. This is all we need:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        #define PERLIO_NOT_STDIO 0
\&        #include "EXTERN.h"
\&        #include "perl.h"
\&        #include "XSUB.h"
\&
\&        #include <stdio.h>
\&
\&        int
\&        fputs(s, stream)
\&                char *          s
\&                FILE *          stream
.Ve
.PP
The real work is done in the standard typemap.
.PP
\&\fBBut\fR you lose all the fine stuff done by the perlio layers. This
calls the stdio function \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, which knows nothing about them.
.PP
The standard typemap offers three variants of PerlIO *:
\&\f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR (T_IN), \f(CW\*(C`InOutStream\*(C'\fR (T_INOUT) and \f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR
(T_OUT). A bare \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR is considered a T_INOUT. If it matters
in your code (see below for why it might) #define or typedef
one of the specific names and use that as the argument or result
type in your \s-1XS\s0 file.
.PP
The standard typemap does not contain PerlIO * before perl 5.7,
but it has the three stream variants. Using a PerlIO * directly
is not backwards compatible unless you provide your own typemap.
.PP
For streams coming \fIfrom\fR perl the main difference is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR will get the output PerlIO * \- which may make
a difference on a socket. Like in our example...
.PP
For streams being handed \fIto\fR perl a new file handle is created
(i.e. a reference to a new glob) and associated with the PerlIO *
provided. If the read/write state of the PerlIO * is not correct then you
may get errors or warnings from when the file handle is used.
So if you opened the PerlIO * as \*(L"w\*(R" it should really be an
\&\f(CW\*(C`OutputStream\*(C'\fR if open as \*(L"r\*(R" it should be an \f(CW\*(C`InputStream\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Now, suppose you want to use perlio layers in your \s-1XS.\s0 We'll use the
perlio \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR function as an example.
.PP
In the C part of the \s-1XS\s0 file (above the first \s-1MODULE\s0 line) you
have
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        #define OutputStream    PerlIO *
\&    or
\&        typedef PerlIO *        OutputStream;
.Ve
.PP
And this is the \s-1XS\s0 code:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        int
\&        perlioputs(s, stream)
\&                char *          s
\&                OutputStream    stream
\&        CODE:
\&                RETVAL = PerlIO_puts(stream, s);
\&        OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
We have to use a \f(CW\*(C`CODE\*(C'\fR section because \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_puts()\*(C'\fR has the arguments
reversed compared to \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR, and we want to keep the arguments the same.
.PP
Wanting to explore this thoroughly, we want to use the stdio \f(CW\*(C`fputs()\*(C'\fR
on a PerlIO *. This means we have to ask the perlio system for a stdio
\&\f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        int
\&        perliofputs(s, stream)
\&                char *          s
\&                OutputStream    stream
\&        PREINIT:
\&                FILE *fp = PerlIO_findFILE(stream);
\&        CODE:
\&                if (fp != (FILE*) 0) {
\&                        RETVAL = fputs(s, fp);
\&                } else {
\&                        RETVAL = \-1;
\&                }
\&        OUTPUT:
\&                RETVAL
.Ve
.PP
Note: \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will search the layers for a stdio
layer. If it can't find one, it will call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR to
generate a new stdio \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. Please only call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR if
you want a \fInew\fR \f(CW\*(C`FILE\*(C'\fR. It will generate one on each call and push a
new stdio layer. So don't call it repeatedly on the same
file. \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR will retrieve the stdio layer once it has been
generated by \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This applies to the perlio system only. For versions before 5.7,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_exportFILE()\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_findFILE()\*(C'\fR.

.SH "NAME"
perlxstypemap \- Perl XS C/Perl type mapping
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into
converting between the data structures that are native to either of
the languages involved.  This trumps other matter such as differing
calling conventions because the problem space is so much greater.
There are simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are
ways to implement a function call.
.PP
Perl \s-1XS\s0' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps.
At an abstract level, a Perl \s-1XS\s0 typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C
data structure and vice versa.  Since there can be C types that
are sufficiently similar to warrant converting with the same logic,
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemaps are represented by a unique identifier, henceforth
called an   <\s-1XS\s0 type> in this document.  You can then tell the \s-1XS\s0
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemap.
.PP
In your \s-1XS\s0 code, when you define an argument with a C type or when
you are using a \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section together with a
C return type of your \s-1XSUB,\s0 it'll be the typemapping mechanism that
makes this easy.
.SS "Anatomy of a typemap"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of a typemap"
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the \fBxsubpp\fR compiler to map C function
parameters and values to Perl values.  The typemap file may consist
of three sections labelled \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR.
An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section.
The \s-1INPUT\s0 section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section tells the
compiler how to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand.  The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 section tells the compiler which
of the \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 code fragments should be used to map a given
C type to a Perl value.  The section labels \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR must begin in the first column on a line by themselves,
and must be in uppercase.
.PP
Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times
and does not have to appear at all.  For example, a typemap may
commonly lack \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections if all it needs to
do is associate additional C types with core \s-1XS\s0 types like T_PTROBJ.
Lines that start with a hash \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are considered comments and ignored
in the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section, but are considered significant in \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR. Blank lines are generally ignored.
.PP
Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
conventionally called \f(CW\*(C`typemap\*(C'\fR in a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution.  With
ExtUtils::ParseXS (the \s-1XS\s0 compiler) version 3.12 or better which
comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded directly into
\&\s-1XS\s0 code using a HERE-doc like syntax:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  TYPEMAP: <<HERE
\&  ...
\&  HERE
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW\*(C`HERE\*(C'\fR can be replaced by other identifiers like with normal
Perl HERE-docs.  All details below about the typemap textual format
remain valid.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section should contain one pair of C type and
\&\s-1XS\s0 type per line as follows.  An example from the core typemap file:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
\&  char *          T_PV
\&  const char *    T_PV
\&  unsigned char * T_PV
\&  ...
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections have identical formats, that is,
each unindented line starts a new in\- or output map respectively.
A new in\- or output map must start with the name of the \s-1XS\s0 type to
map on a line by itself, followed by the code that implements it
indented on the following lines. Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&  T_PTR
\&    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))
.Ve
.PP
We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a
little bit.
.PP
Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C
strings of the \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR type to Perl scalars/strings:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  char *  T_PV
\&
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);
.Ve
.PP
Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
\&\f(CW\*(C`struct netconfig\*(C'\fR to be blessed into the class \f(CW\*(C`Net::Config\*(C'\fR.
One way to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package
names, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
.Ve
.PP
And then provide a typemap entry \f(CW\*(C`T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL\*(C'\fR that maps
underscores to double-colons (::), and declare \f(CW\*(C`Net_Config\*(C'\fR to be of
that type:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")){
\&      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
\&      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
\&    }
\&    else
\&      croak(\e"$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")
\&
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    sv_setref_pv($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e",
\&                 (void*)$var);
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections substitute underscores for double-colons
on the fly, giving the desired effect.  This example demonstrates some
of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INT2PTR\*(C'\fR macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer
of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers
and pointers.  There are also \f(CW\*(C`PTR2IV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2UV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2NV\*(C'\fR macros,
to map the other way, which may be useful in \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections.
.SS "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
.IX Subsection "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
The default typemap in the \fIlib/ExtUtils\fR directory of the Perl source
contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some
extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
These additional typemaps may reference \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 maps in the main
typemap.  The \fBxsubpp\fR compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.  Instead of using
an additional \fItypemap\fR file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in \s-1XS\s0
with a heredoc-like syntax.  See the documentation on the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP:\*(C'\fR \s-1XS\s0
keyword.
.PP
For \s-1CPAN\s0 distributions, you can assume that the \s-1XS\s0 types defined by
the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap
has default \s-1XS\s0 types for a large number of C types.  For example, if
you simply return a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR from your \s-1XSUB,\s0 the core typemap will
have this C type associated with the T_PV \s-1XS\s0 type.  That means your
C string will be copied into the \s-1PV \s0(pointer value) slot of a new scalar
that will be returned from your \s-1XSUB\s0 to to Perl.
.PP
If you're developing a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution using \s-1XS,\s0 you may add your own
file called \fItypemap\fR to the distribution.  That file may contain
typemaps that either map types that are specific to your code or that
override the core typemap file's mappings for common C types.
.SS "Sharing typemaps Between \s-1CPAN\s0 Distributions"
.IX Subsection "Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions"
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16
and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that
offers a certain \s-1API\s0 and have the dependent modules declare that as a
built-time requirement and import the typemap into the \s-1XS.\s0 An example
of such a typemap-sharing module on \s-1CPAN\s0 is
\&\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR. Two steps to getting that module's
typemaps available in your code:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Declare \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR as a build-time dependency
in \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR (use \f(CW\*(C`BUILD_REQUIRES\*(C'\fR), or in your \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR
(use \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Include the following line in the \s-1XS\s0 section of your \s-1XS\s0 file:
(don't break the line)
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X \-MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
\&                   \-e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})"
.Ve
.SS "Writing typemap Entries"
.IX Subsection "Writing typemap Entries"
Each \s-1INPUT\s0 or \s-1OUTPUT\s0 typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string that
will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the
final C code for mapping a certain C type.
.PP
This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here }\*(C'\fR. A common
use case is to generate error messages that refer to the true function
name even when using the \s-1ALIAS XS\s0 feature:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ${ $ALIAS ? \eq[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \eqq[\e"$pname\e"] }
.Ve
.PP
For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be
found in the perl source tree at \fIlib/ExtUtils/typemap\fR.
.PP
The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps
are the following:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$var\fI\fR \- the name of the input or output variable, eg. \s-1RETVAL\s0 for
return values.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$type\fI\fR \- the raw C type of the parameter, any \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR replaced with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR \- the supplied type with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR replaced with \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR.
e.g. for a type of \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR, \fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR is \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$arg\fI\fR \- the stack entry, that the parameter is input from or output
to, e.g. \f(CWST(0)\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$argoff\fI\fR \- the argument stack offset of the argument.  ie. 0 for the
first argument, etc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$pname\fI\fR \- the full name of the \s-1XSUB,\s0 with including the \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
name, with any \f(CW\*(C`PREFIX\*(C'\fR stripped.  This is the non-ALIAS name.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$Package\fI\fR \- the package specified by the most recent \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ALIAS\fI\fR \- non-zero if the current \s-1XSUB\s0 has any aliases declared with
\&\f(CW\*(C`ALIAS\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
.IX Subsection "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
Each C type is represented by an entry in the typemap file that
is responsible for converting perl variables (\s-1SV, AV, HV, CV,\s0 etc.)
to and from that type. The following sections list all \s-1XS\s0 types
that come with perl by default.
.IP "T_SV" 4
.IX Item "T_SV"
This simply passes the C representation of the Perl variable (an SV*)
in and out of the \s-1XS\s0 layer. This can be used if the C code wants
to deal directly with the Perl variable.
.IP "T_SVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning the reference to an SV*.
See also: T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_SVREF_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF_FIXED"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV.\s0
This is a fixed
variant of T_SVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning a reference to an SV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_AVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an AV*. See also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV.\s0 This is a fixed
variant of T_AVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an AV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_HVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV.\s0 This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_CVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV.\s0
.Sp
This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_SYSRET" 4
.IX Item "T_SYSRET"
The T_SYSRET typemap is used to process return values from system calls.
It is only meaningful when passing values from C to perl (there is
no concept of passing a system return value from Perl to C).
.Sp
System calls return \-1 on error (setting \s-1ERRNO\s0 with the reason)
and (usually) 0 on success. If the return value is \-1 this typemap
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR. If the return value is not \-1, this typemap
translates a 0 (perl false) to \*(L"0 but true\*(R" (which
is perl true) or returns the value itself, to indicate that the
command succeeded.
.Sp
The \s-1POSIX\s0 module makes extensive use of this type.
.IP "T_UV" 4
.IX Item "T_UV"
An unsigned integer.
.IP "T_IV" 4
.IX Item "T_IV"
A signed integer. This is cast to the required integer type when
passed to C and converted to an \s-1IV\s0 when passed back to Perl.
.IP "T_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_INT"
A signed integer. This typemap converts the Perl value to a native
integer type (the \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type on the current platform). When returning
the value to perl it is processed in the same way as for T_IV.
.Sp
Its behaviour is identical to using an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type in \s-1XS\s0 with T_IV.
.IP "T_ENUM" 4
.IX Item "T_ENUM"
An enum value. Used to transfer an enum component
from C. There is no reason to pass an enum value to C since
it is stored as an \s-1IV\s0 inside perl.
.IP "T_BOOL" 4
.IX Item "T_BOOL"
A boolean type. This can be used to pass true and false values to and
from C.
.IP "T_U_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_INT"
This is for unsigned integers. It is equivalent to using T_UV
but explicitly casts the variable to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR.
The default type for \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.IP "T_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_SHORT"
Short integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_SHORT"
Unsigned short integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_SHORT is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U16\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_LONG"
Long integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_U_LONG"
Unsigned long integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_LONG is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U32\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_CHAR"
Single 8\-bit characters.
.IP "T_U_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_U_CHAR"
An unsigned byte.
.IP "T_FLOAT" 4
.IX Item "T_FLOAT"
A floating point number. This typemap guarantees to return a variable
cast to a \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_NV" 4
.IX Item "T_NV"
A Perl floating point number. Similar to T_IV and T_UV in that the
return type is cast to the requested numeric type rather than
to a specific type.
.IP "T_DOUBLE" 4
.IX Item "T_DOUBLE"
A double precision floating point number. This typemap guarantees to
return a variable cast to a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PV" 4
.IX Item "T_PV"
A string (char *).
.IP "T_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_PTR"
A memory address (pointer). Typically associated with a \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR
type.
.IP "T_PTRREF" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRREF"
Similar to T_PTR except that the pointer is stored in a scalar and the
reference to that scalar is returned to the caller. This can be used
to hide the actual pointer value from the programmer since it is usually
not required directly from within perl.
.Sp
The typemap checks that a scalar reference is passed from perl to \s-1XS.\s0
.IP "T_PTROBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_PTROBJ"
Similar to T_PTRREF except that the reference is blessed into a class.
This allows the pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to
deal with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object passed
into the \s-1XS\s0 routine is of the correct class (or part of a subclass).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_REF_IV_REF" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_REF"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_REF_IV_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_PTR"
Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the pointer is blessed into a scalar object.
The difference is that when the object is passed back into \s-1XS\s0 it must be
of the correct type (inheritance is not supported).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_PTRDESC" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRDESC"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_REFREF" 4
.IX Item "T_REFREF"
Similar to T_PTRREF, except the pointer stored in the referenced scalar
is dereferenced and copied to the output variable. This means that
T_REFREF is to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?
.Sp
Only the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of this is implemented (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) and there
are no known users in core or on \s-1CPAN.\s0
.IP "T_REFOBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_REFOBJ"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_OPAQUEPTR" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUEPTR"
This can be used to store bytes in the string component of the
\&\s-1SV.\s0 Here the representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the
bytes themselves are just stored in the \s-1SV.\s0 It is assumed that the C
variable is a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory
location).  If the pointer is pointing to something that is
represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the \s-1SV \s0(and
\&\fIlength()\fR will report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.
.Sp
In principle the \fIunpack()\fR command can be used to convert the bytes
back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a number).
.Sp
This entry can be used to store a C structure (the number
of bytes to be copied is calculated using the C \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR function)
and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF without having to worry
about a memory leak (since Perl will clean up the \s-1SV\s0).
.IP "T_OPAQUE" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUE"
This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the string
part of an \s-1SV.\s0 It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the
typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather than assuming it
is being supplied. For example, if an integer is imported into
Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing
the integer will be stored in the \s-1SV\s0 but the actual integer value will
not be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.
.Sp
The data may be retrieved using the \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR function if the
underlying type of the byte stream is known.
.Sp
T_OPAQUE supports input and output of simple types.
T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer
is acceptable.
.IP "Implicit array" 4
.IX Item "Implicit array"
xsubpp supports a special syntax for returning
packed C arrays to perl. If the \s-1XS\s0 return type is given as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  array(type, nelem)
.Ve
.Sp
xsubpp will copy the contents of \f(CW\*(C`nelem * sizeof(type)\*(C'\fR bytes from
\&\s-1RETVAL\s0 to an \s-1SV\s0 and push it onto the stack. This is only really useful
if the number of items to be returned is known at compile time and you
don't mind having a string of bytes in your \s-1SV. \s0 Use T_ARRAY to push a
variable number of arguments onto the return stack (they won't be
packed as a single string though).
.Sp
This is similar to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more
than one element.
.IP "T_PACKED" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKED"
Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR
(\s-1XSUB\s0 to Perl), a function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called
with the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from.
\&\f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type that is to be mapped to
Perl. Normalized means that all \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR are replaced by the
string \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR. The return value of the function is ignored.
.Sp
Conversely for \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) mapping, the
function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called with the input Perl
scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the mapped
C type and assigned to the output C variable.
.Sp
An example conversion function for a typemapped struct
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t *\*(C'\fR might be:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
\&  {
\&    dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */
\&    HV* hash = newHV();
\&    hv_stores(hash, "int_member", newSViv(in\->int_member));
\&    hv_stores(hash, "float_member", newSVnv(in\->float_member));
\&    /* ... */
\&
\&    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
\&    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
The conversion from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader,
but the prototype would be:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static foo_t *
\&  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);
.Ve
.Sp
Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread context
using \f(CW\*(C`dTHX\*(C'\fR, you can define macros of the same name and avoid the
overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly free the memory allocated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_foo_tPtr\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PACKEDARRAY" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKEDARRAY"
T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl
to \s-1XSUB\s0) typemap is indentical, but the \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR typemap passes
an additional argument to the \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR function. This
third parameter indicates the number of elements in the output
so that the function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable
needs to be declared by the user and must have the name
\&\f(CW\*(C`count_$ntype\*(C'\fR where \f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type name
as explained above. The signature of the function would be for
the example above and \f(CW\*(C`foo_t **\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);
.Ve
.Sp
The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap
is concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared variable.
.Sp
Of course, unless you know the number of elements in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`sometype **\*(C'\fR C array, within your \s-1XSUB,\s0 the return value from
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t ** XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)\*(C'\fR will be hard to decypher.
Since the details are all up to the \s-1XS\s0 author (the typemap user),
there are several solutions, none of which particularly elegant.
The most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for
N+1 pointers and assign \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR to the (N+1)th to facilitate
iteration.
.Sp
Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in
the first place is probably preferrable.

.IX Item "T_ARRAY"
This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array
and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl
argument stack.
.Sp
The usual calling signature is
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  @out = array_func( @in );
.Ve
.Sp
Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array but
the input and output arrays must be the last elements in the list.
.Sp
When used to pass a perl list to C the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide a
function (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for
\&'*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer
should be returned. It is up to the \s-1XS\s0 writer to free the memory on
exit from the function. The variable \f(CW\*(C`ix_$var\*(C'\fR is set to the number
of elements in the new array.
.Sp
When returning a C array to Perl the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide an integer
variable called \f(CW\*(C`size_$var\*(C'\fR containing the number of elements in the
array. This is used to determine how many elements should be pushed
onto the return argument stack. This is not required on input since
Perl knows how many arguments are on the stack when the routine is
called. Ordinarily this variable would be called \f(CW\*(C`size_RETVAL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the type of
the array. If the array uses type \f(CW\*(C`intArray *\*(C'\fR xsubpp will
automatically work out that it contains variables of type \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR and
use that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element. All
pointer '*' and 'Array' tags are removed from the name to determine
the subtype.
.IP "T_STDIO" 4

This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using

.IX Item "T_INOUT"
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using

writing. This corresponds to the \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR mode, see also T_IN
and T_OUT.
.Sp
See perliol for more information on the Perl \s-1IO\s0 abstraction
layer. Perl must have been built with \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseperlio\*(C'\fR.

There is no check to assert that the filehandle passed from Perl
to C was created with the right \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR mode.

.SH "NAME"
perlxstypemap \- Perl XS C/Perl type mapping
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into
converting between the data structures that are native to either of
the languages involved.  This trumps other matter such as differing
calling conventions because the problem space is so much greater.
There are simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are
ways to implement a function call.
.PP
Perl \s-1XS\s0' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps.
At an abstract level, a Perl \s-1XS\s0 typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C
data structure and vice versa.  Since there can be C types that
are sufficiently similar to warrant converting with the same logic,
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemaps are represented by a unique identifier, henceforth
called an   <\s-1XS\s0 type> in this document.  You can then tell the \s-1XS\s0
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemap.
.PP
In your \s-1XS\s0 code, when you define an argument with a C type or when
you are using a \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section together with a
C return type of your \s-1XSUB\s0, it'll be the typemapping mechanism that
makes this easy.
.SS "Anatomy of a typemap"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of a typemap"
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the \fBxsubpp\fR compiler to map C function
parameters and values to Perl values.  The typemap file may consist
of three sections labelled \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR.
An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section.
The \s-1INPUT\s0 section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section tells the
compiler how to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand.  The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 section tells the compiler which
of the \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 code fragments should be used to map a given
C type to a Perl value.  The section labels \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR must begin in the first column on a line by themselves,
and must be in uppercase.
.PP
Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times
and does not have to appear at all.  For example, a typemap may
commonly lack \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections if all it needs to
do is associate additional C types with core \s-1XS\s0 types like T_PTROBJ.
Lines that start with a hash \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are considered comments and ignored
in the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section, but are considered significant in \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR. Blank lines are generally ignored.
.PP
Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
conventionally called \f(CW\*(C`typemap\*(C'\fR in a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution.  With
ExtUtils::ParseXS (the \s-1XS\s0 compiler) version 3.12 or better which
comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded directly into
\&\s-1XS\s0 code using a HERE-doc like syntax:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  TYPEMAP: <<HERE
\&  ...
\&  HERE
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW\*(C`HERE\*(C'\fR can be replaced by other identifiers like with normal
Perl HERE-docs.  All details below about the typemap textual format
remain valid.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section should contain one pair of C type and
\&\s-1XS\s0 type per line as follows.  An example from the core typemap file:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
\&  char *          T_PV
\&  const char *    T_PV
\&  unsigned char * T_PV
\&  ...
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections have identical formats, that is,
each unindented line starts a new in\- or output map respectively.
A new in\- or output map must start with the name of the \s-1XS\s0 type to
map on a line by itself, followed by the code that implements it
indented on the following lines. Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&  T_PTR
\&    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))
.Ve
.PP
We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a
little bit.
.PP
Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C
strings of the \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR type to Perl scalars/strings:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  char *  T_PV
\&  
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&  
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);
.Ve
.PP
Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
\&\f(CW\*(C`struct netconfig\*(C'\fR to be blessed into the class \f(CW\*(C`Net::Config\*(C'\fR.
One way to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package
names, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
.Ve
.PP
And then provide a typemap entry \f(CW\*(C`T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL\*(C'\fR that maps
underscores to double-colons (::), and declare \f(CW\*(C`Net_Config\*(C'\fR to be of
that type:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&  
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")){
\&      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
\&      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
\&    }
\&    else
\&      croak(\e"$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")
\&  
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    sv_setref_pv($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e",
\&                 (void*)$var);
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections substitute underscores for double-colons
on the fly, giving the desired effect.  This example demonstrates some
of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INT2PTR\*(C'\fR macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer
of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers
and pointers.  There are also \f(CW\*(C`PTR2IV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2UV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2NV\*(C'\fR macros,
to map the other way, which may be useful in \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections.
.SS "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
.IX Subsection "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
The default typemap in the \fIlib/ExtUtils\fR directory of the Perl source
contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some
extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
These additional typemaps may reference \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 maps in the main
typemap.  The \fBxsubpp\fR compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.  Instead of using
an additional \fItypemap\fR file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in \s-1XS\s0
with a heredoc-like syntax.  See the documentation on the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP:\*(C'\fR \s-1XS\s0
keyword.
.PP
For \s-1CPAN\s0 distributions, you can assume that the \s-1XS\s0 types defined by
the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap
has default \s-1XS\s0 types for a large number of C types.  For example, if
you simply return a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR from your \s-1XSUB\s0, the core typemap will
have this C type associated with the T_PV \s-1XS\s0 type.  That means your
C string will be copied into the \s-1PV\s0 (pointer value) slot of a new scalar
that will be returned from your \s-1XSUB\s0 to to Perl.
.PP
If you're developing a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution using \s-1XS\s0, you may add your own
file called \fItypemap\fR to the distribution.  That file may contain
typemaps that either map types that are specific to your code or that
override the core typemap file's mappings for common C types.
.SS "Sharing typemaps Between \s-1CPAN\s0 Distributions"
.IX Subsection "Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions"
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16
and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that
offers a certain \s-1API\s0 and have the dependent modules declare that as a
built-time requirement and import the typemap into the \s-1XS\s0. An example
of such a typemap-sharing module on \s-1CPAN\s0 is
\&\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR. Two steps to getting that module's
typemaps available in your code:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Declare \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR as a build-time dependency
in \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR (use \f(CW\*(C`BUILD_REQUIRES\*(C'\fR), or in your \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR
(use \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Include the following line in the \s-1XS\s0 section of your \s-1XS\s0 file:
(don't break the line)
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X \-MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
\&                   \-e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})"
.Ve
.SS "Writing typemap Entries"
.IX Subsection "Writing typemap Entries"
Each \s-1INPUT\s0 or \s-1OUTPUT\s0 typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string that
will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the
final C code for mapping a certain C type.
.PP
This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here }\*(C'\fR. A common
use case is to generate error messages that refer to the true function
name even when using the \s-1ALIAS\s0 \s-1XS\s0 feature:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ${ $ALIAS ? \eq[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \eqq[\e"$pname\e"] }
.Ve
.PP
For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be
found in the perl source tree at \fIlib/ExtUtils/typemap\fR.
.PP
The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps
are the following:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$var\fI\fR \- the name of the input or output variable, eg. \s-1RETVAL\s0 for
return values.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$type\fI\fR \- the raw C type of the parameter, any \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR replaced with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR \- the supplied type with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR replaced with \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR.
e.g. for a type of \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR, \fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR is \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$arg\fI\fR \- the stack entry, that the parameter is input from or output
to, e.g. \f(CWST(0)\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$argoff\fI\fR \- the argument stack offset of the argument.  ie. 0 for the
first argument, etc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$pname\fI\fR \- the full name of the \s-1XSUB\s0, with including the \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
name, with any \f(CW\*(C`PREFIX\*(C'\fR stripped.  This is the non-ALIAS name.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$Package\fI\fR \- the package specified by the most recent \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ALIAS\fI\fR \- non-zero if the current \s-1XSUB\s0 has any aliases declared with
\&\f(CW\*(C`ALIAS\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
.IX Subsection "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
Each C type is represented by an entry in the typemap file that
is responsible for converting perl variables (\s-1SV\s0, \s-1AV\s0, \s-1HV\s0, \s-1CV\s0, etc.)
to and from that type. The following sections list all \s-1XS\s0 types
that come with perl by default.
.IP "T_SV" 4
.IX Item "T_SV"
This simply passes the C representation of the Perl variable (an SV*)
in and out of the \s-1XS\s0 layer. This can be used if the C code wants
to deal directly with the Perl variable.
.IP "T_SVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV\s0.
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning the reference to an SV*.
See also: T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_SVREF_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF_FIXED"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV\s0.
This is a fixed
variant of T_SVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning a reference to an SV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_AVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV\s0.
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an AV*. See also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV\s0. This is a fixed
variant of T_AVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an AV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_HVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV\s0.
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV\s0. This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_CVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV\s0.
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV\s0.
.Sp
This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_SYSRET" 4
.IX Item "T_SYSRET"
The T_SYSRET typemap is used to process return values from system calls.
It is only meaningful when passing values from C to perl (there is
no concept of passing a system return value from Perl to C).
.Sp
System calls return \-1 on error (setting \s-1ERRNO\s0 with the reason)
and (usually) 0 on success. If the return value is \-1 this typemap
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR. If the return value is not \-1, this typemap
translates a 0 (perl false) to \*(L"0 but true\*(R" (which
is perl true) or returns the value itself, to indicate that the
command succeeded.
.Sp
The \s-1POSIX\s0 module makes extensive use of this type.
.IP "T_UV" 4
.IX Item "T_UV"
An unsigned integer.
.IP "T_IV" 4
.IX Item "T_IV"
A signed integer. This is cast to the required integer type when
passed to C and converted to an \s-1IV\s0 when passed back to Perl.
.IP "T_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_INT"
A signed integer. This typemap converts the Perl value to a native
integer type (the \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type on the current platform). When returning
the value to perl it is processed in the same way as for T_IV.
.Sp
Its behaviour is identical to using an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type in \s-1XS\s0 with T_IV.
.IP "T_ENUM" 4
.IX Item "T_ENUM"
An enum value. Used to transfer an enum component
from C. There is no reason to pass an enum value to C since
it is stored as an \s-1IV\s0 inside perl.
.IP "T_BOOL" 4
.IX Item "T_BOOL"
A boolean type. This can be used to pass true and false values to and
from C.
.IP "T_U_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_INT"
This is for unsigned integers. It is equivalent to using T_UV
but explicitly casts the variable to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR.
The default type for \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.IP "T_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_SHORT"
Short integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_SHORT"
Unsigned short integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_SHORT is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U16\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_LONG"
Long integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_U_LONG"
Unsigned long integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_LONG is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U32\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_CHAR"
Single 8\-bit characters.
.IP "T_U_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_U_CHAR"
An unsigned byte.
.IP "T_FLOAT" 4
.IX Item "T_FLOAT"
A floating point number. This typemap guarantees to return a variable
cast to a \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_NV" 4
.IX Item "T_NV"
A Perl floating point number. Similar to T_IV and T_UV in that the
return type is cast to the requested numeric type rather than
to a specific type.
.IP "T_DOUBLE" 4
.IX Item "T_DOUBLE"
A double precision floating point number. This typemap guarantees to
return a variable cast to a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PV" 4
.IX Item "T_PV"
A string (char *).
.IP "T_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_PTR"
A memory address (pointer). Typically associated with a \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR
type.
.IP "T_PTRREF" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRREF"
Similar to T_PTR except that the pointer is stored in a scalar and the
reference to that scalar is returned to the caller. This can be used
to hide the actual pointer value from the programmer since it is usually
not required directly from within perl.
.Sp
The typemap checks that a scalar reference is passed from perl to \s-1XS\s0.
.IP "T_PTROBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_PTROBJ"
Similar to T_PTRREF except that the reference is blessed into a class.
This allows the pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to
deal with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object passed
into the \s-1XS\s0 routine is of the correct class (or part of a subclass).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_REF_IV_REF" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_REF"
\&\s-1NOT\s0 \s-1YET\s0
.IP "T_REF_IV_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_PTR"
Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the pointer is blessed into a scalar object.
The difference is that when the object is passed back into \s-1XS\s0 it must be
of the correct type (inheritance is not supported).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_PTRDESC" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRDESC"
\&\s-1NOT\s0 \s-1YET\s0
.IP "T_REFREF" 4
.IX Item "T_REFREF"
Similar to T_PTRREF, except the pointer stored in the referenced scalar
is dereferenced and copied to the output variable. This means that
T_REFREF is to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?
.Sp
Only the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of this is implemented (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) and there
are no known users in core or on \s-1CPAN\s0.
.IP "T_REFOBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_REFOBJ"
\&\s-1NOT\s0 \s-1YET\s0
.IP "T_OPAQUEPTR" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUEPTR"
This can be used to store bytes in the string component of the
\&\s-1SV\s0. Here the representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the
bytes themselves are just stored in the \s-1SV\s0. It is assumed that the C
variable is a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory
location).  If the pointer is pointing to something that is
represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the \s-1SV\s0 (and
\&\fIlength()\fR will report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.
.Sp
In principle the \fIunpack()\fR command can be used to convert the bytes
back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a number).
.Sp
This entry can be used to store a C structure (the number
of bytes to be copied is calculated using the C \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR function)
and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF without having to worry
about a memory leak (since Perl will clean up the \s-1SV\s0).
.IP "T_OPAQUE" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUE"
This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the string
part of an \s-1SV\s0. It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the
typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather than assuming it
is being supplied. For example, if an integer is imported into
Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing
the integer will be stored in the \s-1SV\s0 but the actual integer value will
not be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.
.Sp
The data may be retrieved using the \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR function if the
underlying type of the byte stream is known.
.Sp
T_OPAQUE supports input and output of simple types.
T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer
is acceptable.
.IP "Implicit array" 4
.IX Item "Implicit array"
xsubpp supports a special syntax for returning
packed C arrays to perl. If the \s-1XS\s0 return type is given as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  array(type, nelem)
.Ve
.Sp
xsubpp will copy the contents of \f(CW\*(C`nelem * sizeof(type)\*(C'\fR bytes from
\&\s-1RETVAL\s0 to an \s-1SV\s0 and push it onto the stack. This is only really useful
if the number of items to be returned is known at compile time and you
don't mind having a string of bytes in your \s-1SV\s0.  Use T_ARRAY to push a
variable number of arguments onto the return stack (they won't be
packed as a single string though).
.Sp
This is similar to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more
than one element.
.IP "T_PACKED" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKED"
Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR
(\s-1XSUB\s0 to Perl), a function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called
with the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from.
\&\f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type that is to be mapped to
Perl. Normalized means that all \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR are replaced by the
string \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR. The return value of the function is ignored.
.Sp
Conversely for \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) mapping, the
function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called with the input Perl
scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the mapped
C type and assigned to the output C variable.
.Sp
An example conversion function for a typemapped struct
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t *\*(C'\fR might be:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
\&  {
\&    dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */
\&    HV* hash = newHV();
\&    hv_stores(hash, "int_member", newSViv(in\->int_member));
\&    hv_stores(hash, "float_member", newSVnv(in\->float_member));
\&    /* ... */
\&
\&    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
\&    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
The conversion from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader,
but the prototype would be:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static foo_t *
\&  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);
.Ve
.Sp
Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread context
using \f(CW\*(C`dTHX\*(C'\fR, you can define macros of the same name and avoid the
overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly free the memory allocated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_foo_tPtr\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PACKEDARRAY" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKEDARRAY"
T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl
to \s-1XSUB\s0) typemap is indentical, but the \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR typemap passes
an additional argument to the \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR function. This
third parameter indicates the number of elements in the output
so that the function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable
needs to be declared by the user and must have the name
\&\f(CW\*(C`count_$ntype\*(C'\fR where \f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type name
as explained above. The signature of the function would be for
the example above and \f(CW\*(C`foo_t **\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);
.Ve
.Sp
The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap
is concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared variable.
.Sp
Of course, unless you know the number of elements in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`sometype **\*(C'\fR C array, within your \s-1XSUB\s0, the return value from
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t ** XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)\*(C'\fR will be hard to decypher.
Since the details are all up to the \s-1XS\s0 author (the typemap user),
there are several solutions, none of which particularly elegant.
The most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for
N+1 pointers and assign \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR to the (N+1)th to facilitate
iteration.
.Sp
Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in
the first place is probably preferrable.

\&\s-1NOT\s0 \s-1YET\s0
.IP "T_ARRAY" 4
.IX Item "T_ARRAY"
This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array
and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl
argument stack.
.Sp
The usual calling signature is
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  @out = array_func( @in );
.Ve
.Sp
Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array but
the input and output arrays must be the last elements in the list.
.Sp
When used to pass a perl list to C the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide a
function (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for
\&'*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer
should be returned. It is up to the \s-1XS\s0 writer to free the memory on
exit from the function. The variable \f(CW\*(C`ix_$var\*(C'\fR is set to the number
of elements in the new array.
.Sp
When returning a C array to Perl the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide an integer
variable called \f(CW\*(C`size_$var\*(C'\fR containing the number of elements in the
array. This is used to determine how many elements should be pushed
onto the return argument stack. This is not required on input since
Perl knows how many arguments are on the stack when the routine is
called. Ordinarily this variable would be called \f(CW\*(C`size_RETVAL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the type of
the array. If the array uses type \f(CW\*(C`intArray *\*(C'\fR xsubpp will
automatically work out that it contains variables of type \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR and
use that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element. All
pointer '*' and 'Array' tags are removed from the name to determine
the subtype.
.IP "T_STDIO" 4
.IX Item "T_STDIO"
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using
\&\f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR structures.
.IP "T_INOUT" 4
.IX Item "T_INOUT"
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR structures. The file handle can used for reading and
writing. This corresponds to the \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR mode, see also T_IN
and T_OUT.
.Sp
See perliol for more information on the Perl \s-1IO\s0 abstraction
layer. Perl must have been built with \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseperlio\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
There is no check to assert that the filehandle passed from Perl
to C was created with the right \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR mode.
.Sp
Hint: The perlxstut tutorial covers the T_INOUT, T_IN, and T_OUT
\&\s-1XS\s0 types nicely.
.IP "T_IN" 4
.IX Item "T_IN"
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C to Perl
can only be used for reading (mode \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR).
.IP "T_OUT" 4
.IX Item "T_OUT"
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C to Perl
is set to use the open mode \f(CW\*(C`+>\*(C'\fR.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into
converting between the data structures that are native to either of
the languages involved.  This trumps other matter such as differing
calling conventions because the problem space is so much greater.
There are simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are
ways to implement a function call.
.PP
Perl \s-1XS\s0' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps.
At an abstract level, a Perl \s-1XS\s0 typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C
data structure and vice versa.  Since there can be C types that
are sufficiently similar to warrant converting with the same logic,
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemaps are represented by a unique identifier, henceforth
called an   <\s-1XS\s0 type> in this document.  You can then tell the \s-1XS\s0
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same
\&\s-1XS\s0 typemap.
.PP
In your \s-1XS\s0 code, when you define an argument with a C type or when
you are using a \f(CW\*(C`CODE:\*(C'\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fR section together with a
C return type of your \s-1XSUB,\s0 it'll be the typemapping mechanism that
makes this easy.
.SS "Anatomy of a typemap"
.IX Subsection "Anatomy of a typemap"
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the \fBxsubpp\fR compiler to map C function
parameters and values to Perl values.  The typemap file may consist
of three sections labelled \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR.
An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section.
The \s-1INPUT\s0 section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The \s-1OUTPUT\s0 section tells the
compiler how to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand.  The \s-1TYPEMAP\s0 section tells the compiler which
of the \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 code fragments should be used to map a given
C type to a Perl value.  The section labels \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR must begin in the first column on a line by themselves,
and must be in uppercase.
.PP
Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times
and does not have to appear at all.  For example, a typemap may
commonly lack \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections if all it needs to
do is associate additional C types with core \s-1XS\s0 types like T_PTROBJ.
Lines that start with a hash \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are considered comments and ignored
in the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section, but are considered significant in \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR. Blank lines are generally ignored.
.PP
Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
conventionally called \f(CW\*(C`typemap\*(C'\fR in a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution.  With
ExtUtils::ParseXS (the \s-1XS\s0 compiler) version 3.12 or better which
comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded directly into
\&\s-1XS\s0 code using a HERE-doc like syntax:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  TYPEMAP: <<HERE
\&  ...
\&  HERE
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW\*(C`HERE\*(C'\fR can be replaced by other identifiers like with normal
Perl HERE-docs.  All details below about the typemap textual format
remain valid.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP\*(C'\fR section should contain one pair of C type and
\&\s-1XS\s0 type per line as follows.  An example from the core typemap file:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
\&  char *          T_PV
\&  const char *    T_PV
\&  unsigned char * T_PV
\&  ...
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR sections have identical formats, that is,
each unindented line starts a new in\- or output map respectively.
A new in\- or output map must start with the name of the \s-1XS\s0 type to
map on a line by itself, followed by the code that implements it
indented on the following lines. Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&  T_PTR
\&    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))
.Ve
.PP
We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a
little bit.
.PP
Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C
strings of the \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR type to Perl scalars/strings:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  char *  T_PV
\&
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
\&
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PV
\&    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);
.Ve
.PP
Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
\&\f(CW\*(C`struct netconfig\*(C'\fR to be blessed into the class \f(CW\*(C`Net::Config\*(C'\fR.
One way to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package
names, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
.Ve
.PP
And then provide a typemap entry \f(CW\*(C`T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL\*(C'\fR that maps
underscores to double-colons (::), and declare \f(CW\*(C`Net_Config\*(C'\fR to be of
that type:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  TYPEMAP
\&  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&
\&  INPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")){
\&      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
\&      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
\&    }
\&    else
\&      croak(\e"$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e")
\&
\&  OUTPUT
\&  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
\&    sv_setref_pv($arg, \e"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\e$ntt}\e",
\&                 (void*)$var);
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections substitute underscores for double-colons
on the fly, giving the desired effect.  This example demonstrates some
of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`INT2PTR\*(C'\fR macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer
of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers
and pointers.  There are also \f(CW\*(C`PTR2IV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2UV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PTR2NV\*(C'\fR macros,
to map the other way, which may be useful in \s-1OUTPUT\s0 sections.
.SS "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
.IX Subsection "The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"
The default typemap in the \fIlib/ExtUtils\fR directory of the Perl source
contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some
extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
These additional typemaps may reference \s-1INPUT\s0 and \s-1OUTPUT\s0 maps in the main
typemap.  The \fBxsubpp\fR compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.  Instead of using
an additional \fItypemap\fR file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in \s-1XS\s0
with a heredoc-like syntax.  See the documentation on the \f(CW\*(C`TYPEMAP:\*(C'\fR \s-1XS\s0
keyword.
.PP
For \s-1CPAN\s0 distributions, you can assume that the \s-1XS\s0 types defined by
the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap
has default \s-1XS\s0 types for a large number of C types.  For example, if
you simply return a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR from your \s-1XSUB,\s0 the core typemap will
have this C type associated with the T_PV \s-1XS\s0 type.  That means your
C string will be copied into the \s-1PV \s0(pointer value) slot of a new scalar
that will be returned from your \s-1XSUB\s0 to to Perl.
.PP
If you're developing a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution using \s-1XS,\s0 you may add your own
file called \fItypemap\fR to the distribution.  That file may contain
typemaps that either map types that are specific to your code or that
override the core typemap file's mappings for common C types.
.SS "Sharing typemaps Between \s-1CPAN\s0 Distributions"
.IX Subsection "Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions"
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16
and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that
offers a certain \s-1API\s0 and have the dependent modules declare that as a
built-time requirement and import the typemap into the \s-1XS.\s0 An example
of such a typemap-sharing module on \s-1CPAN\s0 is
\&\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR. Two steps to getting that module's
typemaps available in your code:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Declare \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic\*(C'\fR as a build-time dependency
in \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR (use \f(CW\*(C`BUILD_REQUIRES\*(C'\fR), or in your \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR
(use \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Include the following line in the \s-1XS\s0 section of your \s-1XS\s0 file:
(don't break the line)
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X \-MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
\&                   \-e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})"
.Ve
.SS "Writing typemap Entries"
.IX Subsection "Writing typemap Entries"
Each \s-1INPUT\s0 or \s-1OUTPUT\s0 typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string that
will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the
final C code for mapping a certain C type.
.PP
This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here }\*(C'\fR. A common
use case is to generate error messages that refer to the true function
name even when using the \s-1ALIAS XS\s0 feature:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ${ $ALIAS ? \eq[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \eqq[\e"$pname\e"] }
.Ve
.PP
For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be
found in the perl source tree at \fIlib/ExtUtils/typemap\fR.
.PP
The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps
are the following:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$var\fI\fR \- the name of the input or output variable, eg. \s-1RETVAL\s0 for
return values.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$type\fI\fR \- the raw C type of the parameter, any \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR replaced with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR \- the supplied type with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR replaced with \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR.
e.g. for a type of \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR, \fI\f(CI$ntype\fI\fR is \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$arg\fI\fR \- the stack entry, that the parameter is input from or output
to, e.g. \f(CWST(0)\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$argoff\fI\fR \- the argument stack offset of the argument.  ie. 0 for the
first argument, etc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$pname\fI\fR \- the full name of the \s-1XSUB,\s0 with including the \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
name, with any \f(CW\*(C`PREFIX\*(C'\fR stripped.  This is the non-ALIAS name.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$Package\fI\fR \- the package specified by the most recent \f(CW\*(C`PACKAGE\*(C'\fR
keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$ALIAS\fI\fR \- non-zero if the current \s-1XSUB\s0 has any aliases declared with
\&\f(CW\*(C`ALIAS\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
.IX Subsection "Full Listing of Core Typemaps"
Each C type is represented by an entry in the typemap file that
is responsible for converting perl variables (\s-1SV, AV, HV, CV,\s0 etc.)
to and from that type. The following sections list all \s-1XS\s0 types
that come with perl by default.
.IP "T_SV" 4
.IX Item "T_SV"
This simply passes the C representation of the Perl variable (an SV*)
in and out of the \s-1XS\s0 layer. This can be used if the C code wants
to deal directly with the Perl variable.
.IP "T_SVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning the reference to an SV*.
See also: T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_SVREF_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_SVREF_FIXED"
Used to pass in and return a reference to an \s-1SV.\s0
This is a fixed
variant of T_SVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning a reference to an SV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_AVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an AV*. See also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1AV.\s0 This is a fixed
variant of T_AVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an AV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_HVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash.
From the C level this is a pointer to an \s-1HV.\s0 This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_CVREF" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV.\s0
.Sp
Note that this typemap does not decrement the reference count
when returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED
.IP "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED" 4
.IX Item "T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED"
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. \f(CW$sub\fR = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a \s-1CV.\s0
.Sp
This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately
when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.
.IP "T_SYSRET" 4
.IX Item "T_SYSRET"
The T_SYSRET typemap is used to process return values from system calls.
It is only meaningful when passing values from C to perl (there is
no concept of passing a system return value from Perl to C).
.Sp
System calls return \-1 on error (setting \s-1ERRNO\s0 with the reason)
and (usually) 0 on success. If the return value is \-1 this typemap
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR. If the return value is not \-1, this typemap
translates a 0 (perl false) to \*(L"0 but true\*(R" (which
is perl true) or returns the value itself, to indicate that the
command succeeded.
.Sp
The \s-1POSIX\s0 module makes extensive use of this type.
.IP "T_UV" 4
.IX Item "T_UV"
An unsigned integer.
.IP "T_IV" 4
.IX Item "T_IV"
A signed integer. This is cast to the required integer type when
passed to C and converted to an \s-1IV\s0 when passed back to Perl.
.IP "T_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_INT"
A signed integer. This typemap converts the Perl value to a native
integer type (the \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type on the current platform). When returning
the value to perl it is processed in the same way as for T_IV.
.Sp
Its behaviour is identical to using an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR type in \s-1XS\s0 with T_IV.
.IP "T_ENUM" 4
.IX Item "T_ENUM"
An enum value. Used to transfer an enum component
from C. There is no reason to pass an enum value to C since
it is stored as an \s-1IV\s0 inside perl.
.IP "T_BOOL" 4
.IX Item "T_BOOL"
A boolean type. This can be used to pass true and false values to and
from C.
.IP "T_U_INT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_INT"
This is for unsigned integers. It is equivalent to using T_UV
but explicitly casts the variable to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR.
The default type for \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.IP "T_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_SHORT"
Short integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_SHORT" 4
.IX Item "T_U_SHORT"
Unsigned short integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_SHORT is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U16\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_LONG"
Long integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts
the return to type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR
is T_IV.
.IP "T_U_LONG" 4
.IX Item "T_U_LONG"
Unsigned long integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly
casts the return to type \f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR. The default typemap for
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned long\*(C'\fR is T_UV.
.Sp
T_U_LONG is used for type \f(CW\*(C`U32\*(C'\fR in the standard typemap.
.IP "T_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_CHAR"
Single 8\-bit characters.
.IP "T_U_CHAR" 4
.IX Item "T_U_CHAR"
An unsigned byte.
.IP "T_FLOAT" 4
.IX Item "T_FLOAT"
A floating point number. This typemap guarantees to return a variable
cast to a \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_NV" 4
.IX Item "T_NV"
A Perl floating point number. Similar to T_IV and T_UV in that the
return type is cast to the requested numeric type rather than
to a specific type.
.IP "T_DOUBLE" 4
.IX Item "T_DOUBLE"
A double precision floating point number. This typemap guarantees to
return a variable cast to a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PV" 4
.IX Item "T_PV"
A string (char *).
.IP "T_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_PTR"
A memory address (pointer). Typically associated with a \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR
type.
.IP "T_PTRREF" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRREF"
Similar to T_PTR except that the pointer is stored in a scalar and the
reference to that scalar is returned to the caller. This can be used
to hide the actual pointer value from the programmer since it is usually
not required directly from within perl.
.Sp
The typemap checks that a scalar reference is passed from perl to \s-1XS.\s0
.IP "T_PTROBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_PTROBJ"
Similar to T_PTRREF except that the reference is blessed into a class.
This allows the pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to
deal with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object passed
into the \s-1XS\s0 routine is of the correct class (or part of a subclass).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_REF_IV_REF" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_REF"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_REF_IV_PTR" 4
.IX Item "T_REF_IV_PTR"
Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the pointer is blessed into a scalar object.
The difference is that when the object is passed back into \s-1XS\s0 it must be
of the correct type (inheritance is not supported).
.Sp
The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the name
of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
\&'Ptr'.
.IP "T_PTRDESC" 4
.IX Item "T_PTRDESC"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_REFREF" 4
.IX Item "T_REFREF"
Similar to T_PTRREF, except the pointer stored in the referenced scalar
is dereferenced and copied to the output variable. This means that
T_REFREF is to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?
.Sp
Only the \s-1INPUT\s0 part of this is implemented (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) and there
are no known users in core or on \s-1CPAN.\s0
.IP "T_REFOBJ" 4
.IX Item "T_REFOBJ"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_OPAQUEPTR" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUEPTR"
This can be used to store bytes in the string component of the
\&\s-1SV.\s0 Here the representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the
bytes themselves are just stored in the \s-1SV.\s0 It is assumed that the C
variable is a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory
location).  If the pointer is pointing to something that is
represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the \s-1SV \s0(and
\&\fIlength()\fR will report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.
.Sp
In principle the \fIunpack()\fR command can be used to convert the bytes
back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a number).
.Sp
This entry can be used to store a C structure (the number
of bytes to be copied is calculated using the C \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR function)
and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF without having to worry
about a memory leak (since Perl will clean up the \s-1SV\s0).
.IP "T_OPAQUE" 4
.IX Item "T_OPAQUE"
This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the string
part of an \s-1SV.\s0 It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the
typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather than assuming it
is being supplied. For example, if an integer is imported into
Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing
the integer will be stored in the \s-1SV\s0 but the actual integer value will
not be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.
.Sp
The data may be retrieved using the \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR function if the
underlying type of the byte stream is known.
.Sp
T_OPAQUE supports input and output of simple types.
T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer
is acceptable.
.IP "Implicit array" 4
.IX Item "Implicit array"
xsubpp supports a special syntax for returning
packed C arrays to perl. If the \s-1XS\s0 return type is given as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  array(type, nelem)
.Ve
.Sp
xsubpp will copy the contents of \f(CW\*(C`nelem * sizeof(type)\*(C'\fR bytes from
\&\s-1RETVAL\s0 to an \s-1SV\s0 and push it onto the stack. This is only really useful
if the number of items to be returned is known at compile time and you
don't mind having a string of bytes in your \s-1SV. \s0 Use T_ARRAY to push a
variable number of arguments onto the return stack (they won't be
packed as a single string though).
.Sp
This is similar to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more
than one element.
.IP "T_PACKED" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKED"
Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR
(\s-1XSUB\s0 to Perl), a function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called
with the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from.
\&\f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type that is to be mapped to
Perl. Normalized means that all \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR are replaced by the
string \f(CW\*(C`Ptr\*(C'\fR. The return value of the function is ignored.
.Sp
Conversely for \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl to \s-1XSUB\s0) mapping, the
function named \f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_$ntype\*(C'\fR is called with the input Perl
scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the mapped
C type and assigned to the output C variable.
.Sp
An example conversion function for a typemapped struct
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t *\*(C'\fR might be:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
\&  {
\&    dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */
\&    HV* hash = newHV();
\&    hv_stores(hash, "int_member", newSViv(in\->int_member));
\&    hv_stores(hash, "float_member", newSVnv(in\->float_member));
\&    /* ... */
\&
\&    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
\&    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
The conversion from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader,
but the prototype would be:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static foo_t *
\&  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);
.Ve
.Sp
Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread context
using \f(CW\*(C`dTHX\*(C'\fR, you can define macros of the same name and avoid the
overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly free the memory allocated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`XS_unpack_foo_tPtr\*(C'\fR.
.IP "T_PACKEDARRAY" 4
.IX Item "T_PACKEDARRAY"
T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR (Perl
to \s-1XSUB\s0) typemap is indentical, but the \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT\*(C'\fR typemap passes
an additional argument to the \f(CW\*(C`XS_pack_$ntype\*(C'\fR function. This
third parameter indicates the number of elements in the output
so that the function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable
needs to be declared by the user and must have the name
\&\f(CW\*(C`count_$ntype\*(C'\fR where \f(CW$ntype\fR is the normalized C type name
as explained above. The signature of the function would be for
the example above and \f(CW\*(C`foo_t **\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  static void
\&  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);
.Ve
.Sp
The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap
is concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared variable.
.Sp
Of course, unless you know the number of elements in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`sometype **\*(C'\fR C array, within your \s-1XSUB,\s0 the return value from
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo_t ** XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)\*(C'\fR will be hard to decypher.
Since the details are all up to the \s-1XS\s0 author (the typemap user),
there are several solutions, none of which particularly elegant.
The most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for
N+1 pointers and assign \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR to the (N+1)th to facilitate
iteration.
.Sp
Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in
the first place is probably preferrable.

.IX Item "T_DATAUNIT"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_CALLBACK" 4
.IX Item "T_CALLBACK"
\&\s-1NOT YET\s0
.IP "T_ARRAY" 4
.IX Item "T_ARRAY"
This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array
and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl
argument stack.
.Sp
The usual calling signature is
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  @out = array_func( @in );
.Ve
.Sp
Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array but
the input and output arrays must be the last elements in the list.
.Sp
When used to pass a perl list to C the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide a
function (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for
\&'*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer
should be returned. It is up to the \s-1XS\s0 writer to free the memory on
exit from the function. The variable \f(CW\*(C`ix_$var\*(C'\fR is set to the number
of elements in the new array.
.Sp
When returning a C array to Perl the \s-1XS\s0 writer must provide an integer
variable called \f(CW\*(C`size_$var\*(C'\fR containing the number of elements in the
array. This is used to determine how many elements should be pushed
onto the return argument stack. This is not required on input since
Perl knows how many arguments are on the stack when the routine is
called. Ordinarily this variable would be called \f(CW\*(C`size_RETVAL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the type of
the array. If the array uses type \f(CW\*(C`intArray *\*(C'\fR xsubpp will
automatically work out that it contains variables of type \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR and
use that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element. All
pointer '*' and 'Array' tags are removed from the name to determine
the subtype.
.IP "T_STDIO" 4
.IX Item "T_STDIO"
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using
\&\f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR structures.
.IP "T_INOUT" 4
.IX Item "T_INOUT"
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C using
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR structures. The file handle can used for reading and
writing. This corresponds to the \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR mode, see also T_IN
and T_OUT.
.Sp
See perliol for more information on the Perl \s-1IO\s0 abstraction
layer. Perl must have been built with \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseperlio\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
There is no check to assert that the filehandle passed from Perl
to C was created with the right \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR mode.
.Sp
Hint: The perlxstut tutorial covers the T_INOUT, T_IN, and T_OUT
\&\s-1XS\s0 types nicely.
.IP "T_IN" 4
.IX Item "T_IN"
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C to Perl
can only be used for reading (mode \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR).
.IP "T_OUT" 4
.IX Item "T_OUT"
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C to Perl
is set to use the open mode \f(CW\*(C`+>\*(C'\fR.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pgrep
command searches the process table on the running system and prints the
process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on the command
line.
.Pp
The
.Nm pkill
command searches the process table on the running system and signals all
processes that match the criteria given on the command line.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl F Ar pidfile"
.It Fl F Ar pidfile
Restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
.Ar pidfile
file.
.It Fl G Ar gid
Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar gid .
.It Fl I
Request confirmation before attempting to signal each process.
.It Fl L
The
.Ar pidfile
file given for the
.Fl F
option must be locked with the
.Xr flock 2
syscall or created with
.Xr pidfile 3 .
.It Fl P Ar ppid
Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar ppid .
.It Fl U Ar uid
Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar uid .
.It Fl d Ar delim
Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process ID.
The default is a newline.
This option can only be used with the
.Nm pgrep
command.
.It Fl a
Include process ancestors in the match list.
By default, the current
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
process and all of its ancestors are excluded (unless
.Fl v
is used).
.It Fl f
Match against full argument lists.
The default is to match against process names.
.It Fl g Ar pgrp
Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar pgrp .
The value zero is taken to mean the process group ID of the running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
command.
.It Fl i
Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and the supplied pattern.
.It Fl l
Long output.
For
.Nm pgrep ,
print the process name in addition to the process ID for each matching
process.
If used in conjunction with
.Fl f ,
print the process ID and the full argument list for each matching process.
For
.Nm pkill ,
display the kill command used for each process killed.
.It Fl n
Select only the newest (most recently started) of the matching processes.
.It Fl o
Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the matching processes.
.It Fl q
Do not write anything to standard output.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Restrict matches to processes associated with a terminal in the
comma-separated list
.Ar tty .
Terminal names may be of the form
.Pa tty Ns Ar xx
or the shortened form
.Ar xx .
A single dash
.Pq Ql -
matches processes not associated with a terminal.
.It Fl u Ar euid
Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar euid .
.It Fl v
Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes that do not match the
given criteria.
.It Fl x
Require an exact match of the process name, or argument list if
.Fl f
is given.
The default is to match any substring.
.It Fl Ns Ar signal
A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name specifying the signal
to be sent instead of the default
.Dv TERM .
This option is valid only when given as the first argument to
.Nm pkill .
.El
.Pp
If any
.Ar pattern
operands are specified, they are used as regular expressions to match
the command name or full argument list of each process.
.Pp
Note that a running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
process will never consider itself as
a potential match.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm pgrep
and
.Nm pkill
utilities
return one of the following values upon exit:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
One or more processes were matched.

Name of \fIentry\fP to work on (must include PHAR internal
directory name if any).
.TP
.PD
.B -k \fIindex\fP
Subscription \fIindex\fP to work on.

.SH meta-get command
Get meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package in serialized from. If
no output file is specified for meta data then stdout is being used.
You can also specify a particular index using -k. In that case the
metadata is expected to be an array and the value of the given index
is returned using echo rather than using serialize. If that index does
not exist or no meta data is present then the return value is 1.
.P
Required arguments:
.TP 15
.PD
.B -f \fIfile\fP
Specifies the phar \fIfile\fP to work on.

.SH meta-set command
Set meta data of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package using serialized input. If no
input file is specified for meta data then stdin is being used. You can
also specify a particular index using -k. In that case the metadata is
expected to be an array and the value of the given index is being set.
If the metadata is not present or empty a new array will be created.
If the metadata is present and a flat value then the return value is
1. Also using -k the input is been taken directly rather then being
serialized.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPHP\fP is a widely\-used general\-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for 
Web development and can be embedded into HTML. This is the command line interface
that enables you to do the following:
.P
You can parse and execute files by using parameter \-f followed by the name of the 
.IR file 
to be executed.
.LP
Using parameter \-r you can directly execute PHP 
.IR code 
simply as you would do inside a
.B \.php
file when using the 
.B eval() 
function.
.LP
It is also possible to process the standard input line by line using either
the parameter \-R or \-F. In this mode each separate input line causes the
.IR code 
specified by \-R or the 
.IR file
specified by \-F to be executed.
You can access the input line by \fB$argn\fP. While processing the input lines
.B $argi 
contains the number of the actual line being processed. Further more
the parameters \-B and \-E can be used to execute 
.IR code
(see \-r) before and
after all input lines have been processed respectively. Notice that the
input is read from
.B STDIN
and therefore reading from 
.B STDIN 
explicitly changes the next input line or skips input lines.
.LP
PHP also contains an built-in web server for application development purpose. By using the \-S option where
.B addr:port
point to a local address and port PHP will listen to HTTP requests on that address and port and serve files from the current working directory or the
.B docroot
passed by the \-t option.
.LP
If none of \-r \-f \-B \-R \-F \-E or \-S is present but a single parameter is given 
then this parameter is taken as the filename to parse and execute (same as 
with \-f). If no parameter is present then the standard input is read and 
executed.

.SH FILES
.TP 15
.B php\-cli.ini
The configuration file for the CLI version of PHP.
.TP
.B php.ini
The standard configuration file will only be used when 
.B php\-cli.ini
cannot be found.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
\fIphp \-r 'echo "Hello World\\n";'\fP
This command simply writes the text "Hello World" to standard out.
.TP
\fIphp \-r 'print_r(gd_info());'\fP
This shows the configuration of your gd extension. You can use this
to easily check which image formats you can use. If you have any
dynamic modules you may want to use the same ini file that php uses
when executed from your webserver. There are more extensions which
have such a function. For dba use:
.RS
\fIphp \-r 'print_r(dba_handlers(1));'\fP
.RE
.TP
\fIphp \-R 'echo strip_tags($argn)."\\n";'\fP
This PHP command strips off the HTML tags line by line and outputs the 
result. To see how it works you can first look at the following PHP command
\'\fIphp \-d html_errors=1 \-i\fP\' which uses PHP to output HTML formatted
configuration information. If you then combine those two 
\'\fIphp \.\.\.|php \.\.\.\fP\' you'll see what happens.
.TP
\fIphp \-E 'echo "Lines: $argi\\n";'\fP
Using this PHP command you can count the lines being input.
.TP
\fIphp \-R '@$l+=count(file($argn));' \-E 'echo "Lines:$l\\n";'\fP
In this example PHP expects each input line being a file. It counts all lines 
of the files specified by each input line and shows the summarized result. 
You may combine this with tools like find and change the php scriptlet.
.TP
\fIphp \-R 'echo "$argn\\n"; fgets(STDIN);'\fP
Since you have access to STDIN from within \-B \-R \-F and \-E you can skip 
certain input lines with your code. But note that in such cases $argi only 
counts the lines being processed by php itself. Having read this you will 
guess what the above program does: skipping every second input line.
.SH TIPS
You can use a shebang line to automatically invoke php
from scripts. Only the CLI version of PHP will ignore
such a first line as shown below:

.RS
#!/bin/php

<?php

.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B pic

.B \-nvCSU

[
.I filename
\&.\|.\|.\&
]
.br
.B pic
.B \-t

.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
This manual page describes the GNU version of
.BR pic ,
which is part of the groff document formatting system.
.B pic
compiles descriptions of pictures embedded within
.B troff
or \*(tx input files into commands that are understood by \*(tx or
.BR troff .
Each picture starts with a line beginning with
.B .PS
and ends with a line beginning with
.BR .PE .
Anything outside of
.B .PS
and
.B .PE
is passed through without change.
.LP
It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the
.B PS
and
.B PE
macros.
When the macro package being used does not supply such definitions
(for example, old versions of \-ms),
appropriate definitions can be obtained with
.BR \-mpic :
These will center each picture.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
Options that do not take arguments may be grouped behind a single
.BR \- .
The special option
.B \-\^\-
can be used to mark the end of the options.
A filename of
.B \-
refers to the standard input.
.
.TP
.B \-C
Recognize
.B .PS
and
.B .PE
even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
.
.TP
.B \-S
Safer mode; do not execute
.B sh
commands.
This can be useful when operating on untrustworthy input.
(enabled by default)
.
.TP
.B \-U
Unsafe mode; revert the default option
.BR \-S .
.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't use the groff extensions to the troff drawing commands.
You should use this if you are using a postprocessor that doesn't support
these extensions.
The extensions are described in
.BR groff_out (5).
The
.B \-n
option also causes
.B pic
not to use zero-length lines to draw dots in troff mode.
.
.TP
.B \-t
\*(tx mode.
.
.TP
.B \-c
Be more compatible with
.BR tpic .
Implies
.BR \-t .
Lines beginning with
.B \e
are not passed through transparently.
Lines beginning with
.B .
are passed through with the initial
.B .
changed to
.BR \e .
A line beginning with
.B .ps
is given special treatment:
it takes an optional integer argument specifying
the line thickness (pen size) in milliinches;
a missing argument restores the previous line thickness;
the default line thickness is 8 milliinches.
The line thickness thus specified takes effect only
when a non-negative line thickness has not been
specified by use of the
.B thickness
attribute or by setting the
.B linethick
variable.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.TP
.B \-z
In \*(tx mode draw dots using zero-length lines.
.
.LP
The following options supported by other versions of
.B pic
are ignored:
.
.TP
.B \-D
Draw all lines using the \eD escape sequence.
.B pic
always does this.
.
.TP
.BI \-T \ dev
Generate output for the
.B troff
device
.IR dev .
This is unnecessary because the
.B troff
output generated by
.B pic
is device-independent.
.
.
.SH USAGE
.
This section describes only the differences between GNU
.B pic
and the original version of
.BR pic .
Many of these differences also apply to newer versions of Unix
.BR pic .
A complete documentation is available in the file
.LP
.RS
.B /usr/share/doc/groff/1.19.2/pic.ms
.RE
.
.SS \*(tx mode
.
\*(tx mode is enabled by the
.B \-t
option.
In \*(tx mode,
.B pic
will define a vbox called
.B \egraph
for each picture.
Use the
.B figname
command to change the name of the vbox.
You must yourself print that vbox using, for example, the command
.RS
.LP
.B
\ecenterline{\ebox\egraph}
.RE
.LP
Actually, since the vbox has a height of zero (it is defined with
\evtop) this will produce slightly more vertical space above the
picture than below it;
.RS
.LP
.B
\ecenterline{\eraise 1em\ebox\egraph}
.RE
.LP
would avoid this.
.LP
To make the vbox having a positive height and a depth of zero
(as used e.g.\& by \*(lx's
.BR \%graphics.sty ),
define the following macro in your document:
.RS
.LP
.B \edef\egpicbox#1{%
.br
.B "   \evbox{\eunvbox\ecsname #1\eendcsname\ekern 0pt}}"
.RE
.LP
Now you can simply say
.B \egpicbox{graph}
instead of \ebox\egraph.
.LP
You must use a \*(tx driver that supports the
.B tpic
specials, version 2.
.LP
Lines beginning with
.B \e
are passed through transparently; a
.B %
is added to the end of the line to avoid unwanted spaces.
You can safely use this feature to change fonts or to
change the value of
.BR \ebaselineskip .
Anything else may well produce undesirable results; use at your own risk.
Lines beginning with a period are not given any special treatment.

.SS Commands
.
.TP
\fBfor\fR \fIvariable\fR \fB=\fR \fIexpr1\fR \fBto\fR \fIexpr2\fR \
[\fBby\fR [\fB*\fR]\fIexpr3\fR] \fBdo\fR \fIX\fR \fIbody\fR \fIX\fR
Set
.I variable
to
.IR expr1 .
While the value of
.I variable
is less than or equal to
.IR expr2 ,
do
.I body
and increment
.I variable
by
.IR expr3 ;
if
.B by
is not given, increment
.I variable
by 1.
If
.I expr3
is prefixed by
.B *
then
.I variable
will instead be multiplied by
.IR expr3 .
The value of
.I expr3
can be negative for the additive case;
.I variable
is then tested whether it is greater than or equal to
.IR expr2 .
For the multiplicative case,
.I expr3
must be greater than zero.
If the constraints aren't met, the loop isn't executed.
.I X
can be any character not occurring in
.IR body .
.
.TP
\fBif\fR \fIexpr\fR \fBthen\fR \fIX\fR \fIif-true\fR \fIX\fR \
[\fBelse\fR \fIY\fR \fIif-false\fR \fIY\fR]
Evaluate
.IR expr ;
if it is non-zero then do
.IR if-true ,
otherwise do
.IR if-false .
.I X
can be any character not occurring in
.IR if-true .
.I Y
can be any character not occurring in
.IR if-false .
.
.TP
\fBprint\fR \fIarg\fR\|.\|.\|.
Concatenate the arguments and print as a line on stderr.
Each
.I arg
must be an expression, a position, or text.
This is useful for debugging.
.
.TP
\fBcommand\fR \fIarg\fR\|.\|.\|.
Concatenate the arguments
and pass them through as a line to troff or \*(tx.
Each
.I arg
must be an expression, a position, or text.
This has a similar effect to a line beginning with
.B .\&
or
.BR \e ,
but allows the values of variables to be passed through.
For example,
.RS
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.PS
x = 14
command ".ds string x is " x "."
\&.PE
\e*[string]
.ft
.fi
.RE
.IP
prints
.RS
.IP
.B x is 14.
.RE
.
.TP
\fBsh\fR \fIX\fR \fIcommand\fR \fIX\fR
Pass
.I command
to a shell.
.I X
can be any character not occurring in
.IR command .
.
.TP
\fBcopy\fR \fB"\fIfilename\fB"\fR
Include
.I filename
at this point in the file.
.
.TP
\fBcopy\fR [\fB"\fIfilename\fB"\fR] \fBthru\fR \fIX\fR \fIbody\fR \fIX\fR \

.ns
.TP
\fBcopy\fR [\fB"\fIfilename\fB"\fR] \fBthru\fR \fImacro\fR \
[\fBuntil\fR \fB"\fIword\*(ic\fB"\fR]
This construct does
.I body
once for each line of
.IR filename ;
the line is split into blank-delimited words,
and occurrences of
.BI $ i
in
.IR body ,
for
.I i
between 1 and 9,
are replaced by the
.IR i -th
word of the line.
If
.I filename
is not given, lines are taken from the current input up to
.BR .PE .
If an
.B until
clause is specified,
lines will be read only until a line the first word of which is
.IR word ;
that line will then be discarded.
.I X
can be any character not occurring in
.IR body .
For example,
.RS
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.PS
copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until "END"
1 2
3 4
5 6
END
box
\&.PE
.ft
.fi
.RE
.IP
is equivalent to
.RS
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.PS
circle at (1,2)
circle at (3,4)
circle at (5,6)
box
\&.PE
.ft
.fi
.RE
.IP
The commands to be performed for each line can also be taken
from a macro defined earlier by giving the name of the macro
as the argument to
.BR thru .
.
.LP
.B reset
.br
.ns
.TP
\fBreset\fI variable1\fR[\fB,\fR]\fI variable2 .\^.\^.
Reset pre-defined variables
.IR variable1 ,
.I variable2
\&.\^.\^. to their default values.
If no arguments are given, reset all pre-defined variables
to their default values.
Note that assigning a value to
.B scale
also causes all pre-defined variables that control dimensions
to be reset to their default values times the new value of scale.
.
.TP
\fBplot\fR \fIexpr\fR [\fB"\fItext\*(ic\fB"\fR]
This is a text object which is constructed by using
.I text
as a format string for sprintf
with an argument of
.IR expr .
If
.I text
is omitted a format string of
.B "\(ts%g\(ts"
is used.
Attributes can be specified in the same way as for a normal text
object.
Be very careful that you specify an appropriate format string;
.B pic
does only very limited checking of the string.
This is deprecated in favour of
.BR sprintf .
.
.TP
.IB variable\  := \ expr
This is similar to
.B =
except
.I variable
must already be defined,
and
.I expr
will be assigned to
.I variable
without creating a variable local to the current block.
(By contrast,
.B =
defines the variable in the current block if it is not already defined there,
and then changes the value in the current block only.)
For example, the following:
.RS
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.PS
x = 3
y = 3
[
  x := 5
  y = 5
]
print x " " y
\&.PE
.ft
.fi
.RE
.IP
prints
.RS
.IP
.B 5 3
.RE
.
.LP
Arguments of the form
.IP
.I X anything X
.LP
are also allowed to be of the form
.IP
.BI {\  anything\  }
.LP
In this case
.I anything
can contain balanced occurrences of
.B {
and
.BR } .
Strings may contain
.I X
or imbalanced occurrences of
.B {
and
.BR } .
.
.SS Expressions

.LP
String comparison expressions must be parenthesised in some contexts
to avoid ambiguity.
.
.SS Other Changes
.
A bare expression,
.IR expr ,
is acceptable as an attribute;
it is equivalent to
.IR dir\ expr ,
where
.I dir
is the current direction.
For example
.LP
.RS
.B line 2i
.RE
.LP
means draw a line 2\ inches long in the current direction.
The `i' (or `I') character is ignored; to use another measurement unit,
set the
.I scale
variable to an appropriate value.
.
.LP
The maximum width and height of the picture are taken from the variables
.B maxpswid
and
.BR maxpsht .
Initially these have values 8.5 and 11.
.
.LP
Scientific notation is allowed for numbers.
For example
.RS
.LP
.B
x = 5e\-2
.RE
.
.LP
Text attributes can be compounded.
For example,
.RS
.LP
.B
"foo" above ljust
.RE
.LP
is valid.
.
.LP
There is no limit to the depth to which blocks can be examined.
For example,
.RS
.LP
.B
[A: [B: [C: box ]]] with .A.B.C.sw at 1,2
.br
.B
circle at last [\^].A.B.C
.RE
.LP
is acceptable.
.
.LP
Arcs now have compass points
determined by the circle of which the arc is a part.
.
.LP
Circles, ellipses, and arcs can be dotted or dashed.
In \*(tx mode splines can be dotted or dashed also.
.
.LP
Boxes can have rounded corners.
The
.B rad
attribute specifies the radius of the quarter-circles at each corner.
If no
.B rad
or
.B diam
attribute is given, a radius of
.B boxrad
is used.
Initially,
.B boxrad
has a value of\ 0.
A box with rounded corners can be dotted or dashed.
.
.LP
The
.B .PS
line can have a second argument specifying a maximum height for
the picture.
If the width of zero is specified the width will be ignored in computing
the scaling factor for the picture.
Note that GNU
.B pic
will always scale a picture by the same amount vertically as well as
horizontally.
This is different from the
.SM DWB
2.0
.B pic
which may scale a picture by a different amount vertically than
horizontally if a height is specified.
.
.LP
Each text object has an invisible box associated with it.
The compass points of a text object are determined by this box.
The implicit motion associated with the object is also determined
by this box.
The dimensions of this box are taken from the width and height attributes;
if the width attribute is not supplied then the width will be taken to be
.BR textwid ;
if the height attribute is not supplied then the height will be taken to be
the number of text strings associated with the object
times
.BR textht .
Initially
.B textwid
and
.B textht
have a value of 0.
.
.LP
In (almost all) places where a quoted text string can be used,
an expression of the form
.IP
.BI sprintf(\(ts format \(ts,\  arg ,\fR.\|.\|.\fB)
.LP
can also be used;
this will produce the arguments formatted according to
.IR format ,
which should be a string as described in
.BR printf (3)
appropriate for the number of arguments supplied.
.
.LP
The thickness of the lines used to draw objects is controlled by the
.B linethick
variable.
This gives the thickness of lines in points.
A negative value means use the default thickness:
in \*(tx output mode, this means use a thickness of 8 milliinches;
in \*(tx output mode with the
.B -c
option, this means use the line thickness specified by
.B .ps
lines;
in troff output mode, this means use a thickness proportional
to the pointsize.
A zero value means draw the thinnest possible line supported by
the output device.
Initially it has a value of -1.
There is also a
.BR thick [ ness ]
attribute.
For example,
.RS
.LP
.B circle thickness 1.5
.RE
.LP
would draw a circle using a line with a thickness of 1.5 points.
The thickness of lines is not affected by the
value of the
.B scale
variable, nor by the width or height given in the
.B .PS
line.
.
.LP
Boxes (including boxes with rounded corners),
circles and ellipses can be filled by giving them an attribute of
.BR fill [ ed ].
This takes an optional argument of an expression with a value between
0 and 1; 0 will fill it with white, 1 with black, values in between
with a proportionally gray shade.
A value greater than 1 can also be used:
this means fill with the
shade of gray that is currently being used for text and lines.
Normally this will be black, but output devices may provide
a mechanism for changing this.
Without an argument, then the value of the variable
.B fillval
will be used.
Initially this has a value of 0.5.
The invisible attribute does not affect the filling of objects.
Any text associated with a filled object will be added after the
object has been filled, so that the text will not be obscured
by the filling.
.
.LP
Three additional modifiers are available to specify colored objects:
.BR outline [ d ]
sets the color of the outline,
.B shaded
the fill color, and
.B colo\fR[\fPu\fR]\fPr\fR[\fPed\fR]
sets both.
All three keywords expect a suffix specifying the color, for example
.RS
.LP
.B circle shaded """green""" outline """black"""
.RE
.LP
Currently, color support isn't available in \*(tx mode.
Predefined color names for
.B groff
are in the device macro files, for example
.BR ps.tmac ;
additional colors can be defined with the
.B .defcolor
request (see the manual page of
.BR troff (1)
for more details).
.LP
To change the name of the vbox in \*(tx mode, set the pseudo-variable
.B figname
(which is actually a specially parsed command) within a picture.
Example:
.RS
.LP
.B .PS
.br
.B figname = foobar;
.br
.B ...
.br
.B .PE
.RE
.LP
The picture is then available in the box
.BR \efoobar .
.LP
.B pic
assumes that at the beginning of a picture both glyph and fill color are
set to the default value.
.
.LP
Arrow heads will be drawn as solid triangles if the variable
.B arrowhead
is non-zero and either \*(tx mode is enabled or the
.B \-n
option has not been given.
Initially
.B arrowhead
has a value of\ 1.
Note that solid arrow heads are always filled with the current outline
color.
.
.LP
The troff output of
.B pic
is device-independent.
The
.B \-T
option is therefore redundant.
All numbers are taken to be in inches; numbers are never interpreted
to be in troff machine units.
.
.LP
Objects can have an
.B aligned
attribute.
This will only work if the postprocessor is
.BR grops .
Any text associated with an object having the
.B aligned
attribute will be rotated about the center of the object
so that it is aligned in the direction from the start point
to the end point of the object.
Note that this attribute will have no effect for objects whose start and
end points are coincident.
.
.LP
In places where
.IB n th
is allowed
.BI ` expr 'th
is also allowed.
Note that
.B 'th
is a single token: no space is allowed between the
.B '
and the
.BR th .
For example,
.IP
.ft B
.nf
for i = 1 to 4 do {
   line from `i'th box.nw to `i+1'th box.se
}
.ft
.fi
.
.
.SH CONVERSION
.
To obtain a stand-alone picture from a
.B pic
file, enclose your
.B pic
code with
.B .PS
and
.B .PE
requests;
.B roff
configuration commands may be added at the beginning of the file, but no
.B roff
text.
.
.LP
It is necessary to feed this file into
.B groff
without adding any page information, so you must check which
.B .PS
and
.B .PE
requests are actually called.
For example, the mm macro package adds a page number, which is very
annoying.
At the moment, calling standard
.B groff
without any macro package works.
Alternatively, you can define your own requests, e.g. to do nothing:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ft B
\&.de PS
\&..
\&.de PE
\&..
.ft
.fi
.RE
.
.LP
.B groff
itself does not provide direct conversion into other graphics file
formats.
But there are lots of possibilities if you first transform your picture
into PostScript\*R format using the
.B groff
option
.BR -Tps .
Since this
.IR ps -file
lacks BoundingBox information it is not very useful by itself, but it
may be fed into other conversion programs, usually named
.BI ps2 other
or
.BI psto other
or the like.
Moreover, the PostScript interpreter
.B ghostscript
.RB ( gs )
has built-in graphics conversion devices that are called with the option
.LP
.RS
.BI "gs -sDEVICE=" <devname>
.RE
.LP
Call
.LP
.RS
.B gs --help
.RE
.LP
for a list of the available devices.
.
.LP
As the Encapsulated PostScript File Format
.B EPS
is getting more and more important, and the conversion wasn't regarded
trivial in the past you might be interested to know that there is a
conversion tool named
.B ps2eps
which does the right job.
It is much better than the tool
.B ps2epsi
packaged with
.BR gs .
.LP
For bitmapped graphic formats, you should use
.BR pstopnm ;
the resulting (intermediate)
.B PNM
file can be then converted to virtually any graphics format using the tools
of the
.B netpbm
package .

.TH PIC2GRAPH 1 "27 October 2003" "Groff Version 1.19.2"
.IX pic2graph
.SH NAME
pic2graph \- convert a PIC diagram into a cropped image
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pic2graph
[
.B \-unsafe
]
[
.BI \-format\  fmt
]
[
.BI \-eqn\  delim
]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a PIC program as input; produces an image file (by default in
Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as output.
Also translates
.BR eqn (1)
constructs, so it can be used for generating images of mathematical
formulae.
.P
PIC is a rather expressive graphics minilanguage suitable for
producing box-and-arrow diagrams of the kind frequently used in
technical papers and textbooks.  The language is sufficiently flexible
to be quite useful for state charts, Petri-net diagrams, flow charts,
simple circuit schematics, jumper layouts, and other kinds of
illustration involving repetitive uses of simple geometric forms and
splines.  Because PIC descriptions are procedural and object-based,
they are both compact and easy to modify.
.P
The PIC language is fully documented in "\fIMaking Pictures With GNU
PIC\fP", a document which is part of the
.BR groff (1)
distribution.
.P
Your input PIC code should \fInot\fR be wrapped with the .PS and .PE macros
that normally guard it within 
.BR groff (1) 
macros.
.P
The output image will be a black-on-white graphic clipped to the
smallest possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.
By specifying command-line options to be passed to 
.BR convert (1)
you can give it a border, set the background transparent, set the
image's pixel density, or perform other useful transformations.
.P
This program uses 
.BR pic (1),
.BR eqn (1),
.BR groff (1),
.BR gs (1),
and the ImageMagick
.BR convert (1)
program.
These programs must be installed on your system and accessible on your
$PATH for \fBpic2graph\fR to work.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-unsafe
Run 
.BR pic (1)
and
.BR groff (1)
in the `unsafe' mode enabling the PIC macro
.B sh
to execute arbitrary commands.  The default is to forbid this.
.TP
.BI \-format\  fmt
Specify an output format; the default is PNG (Portable Network Graphics).
Any format that
.BR convert (1)
can emit is supported.
.TP
.BI \-eqn\  delim
Change the fencepost characters that delimit 
.BR eqn (1)
directives
.RB ( $
and
.BR $ ,
by default).  This option requires an argument, but an empty string is
accepted as a directive to disable
.BR eqn (1)
processing.
.PP
Command-line switches and arguments not listed above are passed to
.BR convert (1).
.
.
.SH FILES
.TP \w'\fB/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/eqnrc'u+2n
.B /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/eqnrc
The 
.BR eqn (1)
initialization file.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B GROFF_TMPDIR
The directory in which temporary files will be created.
If this is not set
.B pic2graph
searches the environment variables
.BR \%TMPDIR ,
.BR TMP ,
and
.B TEMP
(in that order).
Otherwise, temporary files will be created in
.BR /tmp .

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBpiconv\fR is perl version of \fBiconv\fR, a character encoding converter
widely available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily
a technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
place of iconv for virtually any case.
.PP
piconv converts the character encoding of either \s-1STDIN\s0 or files
specified in the argument and prints out to \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
Here is the list of options.  Each option can be in short format (\-f)
or long (\-\-from).
.IP "\-f,\-\-from from_encoding" 4
.IX Item "-f,--from from_encoding"
Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike \fBiconv\fR,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.
.IP "\-t,\-\-to to_encoding" 4
.IX Item "-t,--to to_encoding"
Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike \fBiconv\fR,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.
.Sp
Therefore, when both \-f and \-t are omitted, \fBpiconv\fR just acts
like \fBcat\fR.
.IP "\-s,\-\-string \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s,--string string"
uses \fIstring\fR instead of file for the source of text.
.IP "\-l,\-\-list" 4
.IX Item "-l,--list"
Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many standard
and common aliases work, such as \*(L"latin1\*(R" for \*(L"\s-1ISO\-8859\-1\*(R",\s0 or \*(L"ibm850\*(R"
instead of \*(L"cp850\*(R", or \*(L"winlatin1\*(R" for \*(L"cp1252\*(R".  See Encode::Supported
for a full discussion.
.IP "\-C,\-\-check \fIN\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C,--check N"
Check the validity of the stream if \fIN\fR = 1.  When \fIN\fR = \-1, something
interesting happens when it encounters an invalid character.
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`\-C 1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-p,\-\-perlqq" 4
.IX Item "-p,--perlqq"
.PD 0
.IP "\-\-htmlcref" 4
.IX Item "--htmlcref"
.IP "\-\-xmlcref" 4

.Sp
.Vb 1

.IX Item "-D,--debug"
Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.

.IX Item "-S,--scheme scheme"
Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available schemes
are as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "from_to" 4
.IX Item "from_to"
Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBpiconv\fR is perl version of \fBiconv\fR, a character encoding converter
widely available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily
a technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
place of iconv for virtually any case.
.PP
piconv converts the character encoding of either \s-1STDIN\s0 or files
specified in the argument and prints out to \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
Here is the list of options.  Each option can be in short format (\-f)
or long (\-\-from).
.IP "\-f,\-\-from from_encoding" 4
.IX Item "-f,--from from_encoding"
Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike \fBiconv\fR,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.
.IP "\-t,\-\-to to_encoding" 4
.IX Item "-t,--to to_encoding"
Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike \fBiconv\fR,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.
.Sp
Therefore, when both \-f and \-t are omitted, \fBpiconv\fR just acts
like \fBcat\fR.
.IP "\-s,\-\-string \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s,--string string"
uses \fIstring\fR instead of file for the source of text.
.IP "\-l,\-\-list" 4
.IX Item "-l,--list"
Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many standard
and common aliases work, such as \*(L"latin1\*(R" for \*(L"\s-1ISO\-8859\-1\*(R",\s0 or \*(L"ibm850\*(R"
instead of \*(L"cp850\*(R", or \*(L"winlatin1\*(R" for \*(L"cp1252\*(R".  See Encode::Supported
for a full discussion.
.IP "\-C,\-\-check \fIN\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C,--check N"
Check the validity of the stream if \fIN\fR = 1.  When \fIN\fR = \-1, something
interesting happens when it encounters an invalid character.
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`\-C 1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-p,\-\-perlqq" 4
.IX Item "-p,--perlqq"
.PD 0
.IP "\-\-htmlcref" 4
.IX Item "--htmlcref"
.IP "\-\-xmlcref" 4
.IX Item "--xmlcref"
.PD
Applies \s-1PERLQQ, HTMLCREF, XMLCREF,\s0 respectively.  Try
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  piconv \-f utf8 \-t ascii \-\-perlqq
.Ve
.Sp
To see what it does.
.IP "\-h,\-\-help" 4
.IX Item "-h,--help"
Show usage.
.IP "\-D,\-\-debug" 4
.IX Item "-D,--debug"
Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.
.IP "\-S,\-\-scheme scheme" 4
.IX Item "-S,--scheme scheme"
Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available schemes
are as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "from_to" 4
.IX Item "from_to"
Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.
.IP "decode_encode" 4
.IX Item "decode_encode"
Input strings are \fIdecode()\fRd then \fIencode()\fRd.  A straight two-step
implementation.
.IP "perlio" 4
.IX Item "perlio"
The new perlIO layer is used.  \s-1NI\-S\s0' favorite.
.Sp
You should use this option if you are using \s-1UTF\-16\s0 and others which
linefeed is not $/.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Like the \fI\-D\fR option, this is also for Encode hackers.

PKCS#12 files unreadable.
.SH "FILE CREATION OPTIONS"
.IX Header "FILE CREATION OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-export\fR" 4
.IX Item "-export"
This option specifies that a PKCS#12 file will be created rather than
parsed.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies filename to write the PKCS#12 file to. Standard output is used
by default.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
The filename to read certificates and private keys from, standard input by default.
They must all be in \s-1PEM\s0 format. The order doesn't matter but one private key and
its corresponding certificate should be present. If additional certificates are
present they will also be included in the PKCS#12 file.
.IP "\fB\-inkey filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inkey filename"
file to read private key from. If not present then a private key must be present
in the input file.
.IP "\fB\-name friendlyname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-name friendlyname"
This specifies the \*(L"friendly name\*(R" for the certificate and private key. This name
is typically displayed in list boxes by software importing the file.
.IP "\fB\-certfile filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-certfile filename"
A filename to read additional certificates from.
.IP "\fB\-caname friendlyname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-caname friendlyname"
This specifies the \*(L"friendly name\*(R" for other certificates. This option may be
used multiple times to specify names for all certificates in the order they
appear. Netscape ignores friendly names on other certificates whereas \s-1MSIE\s0
displays them.
.IP "\fB\-pass arg\fR, \fB\-passout arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass arg, -passout arg"
the PKCS#12 file (i.e. output file) password source. For more information about
the format of \fBarg\fR see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in
\&\fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-passin password\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin password"
pass phrase source to decrypt any input private keys with. For more information
about the format of \fBarg\fR see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in
\&\fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-chain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-chain"
if this option is present then an attempt is made to include the entire
certificate chain of the user certificate. The standard \s-1CA\s0 store is used
for this search. If the search fails it is considered a fatal error.
.IP "\fB\-descert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-descert"
encrypt the certificate using triple \s-1DES,\s0 this may render the PKCS#12
file unreadable by some \*(L"export grade\*(R" software. By default the private
key is encrypted using triple \s-1DES\s0 and the certificate using 40 bit \s-1RC2.\s0
.IP "\fB\-keypbe alg\fR, \fB\-certpbe alg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keypbe alg, -certpbe alg"
these options allow the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and
certificates to be selected. Although any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 algorithms
can be selected it is advisable only to use PKCS#12 algorithms. See the list
in the \fB\s-1NOTES\s0\fR section for more information.
.IP "\fB\-keyex|\-keysig\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyex|-keysig"
specifies that the private key is to be used for key exchange or just signing.
This option is only interpreted by \s-1MSIE\s0 and similar \s-1MS\s0 software. Normally
\&\*(L"export grade\*(R" software will only allow 512 bit \s-1RSA\s0 keys to be used for
encryption purposes but arbitrary length keys for signing. The \fB\-keysig\fR
option marks the key for signing only. Signing only keys can be used for
S/MIME signing, authenticode (ActiveX control signing)  and \s-1SSL\s0 client
authentication, however due to a bug only \s-1MSIE 5.0\s0 and later support
the use of signing only keys for \s-1SSL\s0 client authentication.
.IP "\fB\-nomaciter\fR, \fB\-noiter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nomaciter, -noiter"
these options affect the iteration counts on the \s-1MAC\s0 and key algorithms.
Unless you wish to produce files compatible with \s-1MSIE 4.0\s0 you should leave
these options alone.
.Sp
To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common passwords the
algorithm that derives keys from passwords can have an iteration count applied
to it: this causes a certain part of the algorithm to be repeated and slows it
down. The \s-1MAC\s0 is used to check the file integrity but since it will normally
have the same password as the keys and certificates it could also be attacked.
By default both \s-1MAC\s0 and encryption iteration counts are set to 2048, using
these options the \s-1MAC\s0 and encryption iteration counts can be set to 1, since
this reduces the file security you should not use these options unless you
really have to. Most software supports both \s-1MAC\s0 and key iteration counts.
\&\s-1MSIE 4.0\s0 doesn't support \s-1MAC\s0 iteration counts so it needs the \fB\-nomaciter\fR
option.
.IP "\fB\-maciter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-maciter"
This option is included for compatibility with previous versions, it used
to be needed to use \s-1MAC\s0 iterations counts but they are now used by default.
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Although there are a large number of options most of them are very rarely
used. For PKCS#12 file parsing only \fB\-in\fR and \fB\-out\fR need to be used
for PKCS#12 file creation \fB\-export\fR and \fB\-name\fR are also used.
.PP
If none of the \fB\-clcerts\fR, \fB\-cacerts\fR or \fB\-nocerts\fR options are present
then all certificates will be output in the order they appear in the input
PKCS#12 files. There is no guarantee that the first certificate present is
the one corresponding to the private key. Certain software which requires
a private key and certificate and assumes the first certificate in the
file is the one corresponding to the private key: this may not always
be the case. Using the \fB\-clcerts\fR option will solve this problem by only
outputting the certificate corresponding to the private key. If the \s-1CA\s0
certificates are required then they can be output to a separate file using
the \fB\-nokeys \-cacerts\fR options to just output \s-1CA\s0 certificates.
.PP
The \fB\-keypbe\fR and \fB\-certpbe\fR algorithms allow the precise encryption
algorithms for private keys and certificates to be specified. Normally
the defaults are fine but occasionally software can't handle triple \s-1DES\s0
encrypted private keys, then the option \fB\-keypbe \s-1PBE\-SHA1\-RC2\-40\s0\fR can
be used to reduce the private key encryption to 40 bit \s-1RC2. A\s0 complete
description of all algorithms is contained in the \fBpkcs8\fR manual page.

.Ve
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Some would argue that the PKCS#12 standard is one big bug :\-)
.PP
Versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.6a had a bug in the PKCS#12 key generation
routines. Under rare circumstances this could produce a PKCS#12 file encrypted
with an invalid key. As a result some PKCS#12 files which triggered this bug
from other implementations (\s-1MSIE\s0 or Netscape) could not be decrypted
by OpenSSL and similarly OpenSSL could produce PKCS#12 files which could
not be decrypted by other implementations. The chances of producing such
a file are relatively small: less than 1 in 256.
.PP
A side effect of fixing this bug is that any old invalidly encrypted PKCS#12
files cannot no longer be parsed by the fixed version. Under such circumstances
the \fBpkcs12\fR utility will report that the \s-1MAC\s0 is \s-1OK\s0 but fail with a decryption
error when extracting private keys.
.PP
This problem can be resolved by extracting the private keys and certificates
from the PKCS#12 file using an older version of OpenSSL and recreating the PKCS#12
file from the keys and certificates using a newer version of OpenSSL. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& old\-openssl \-in bad.p12 \-out keycerts.pem
\& openssl \-in keycerts.pem \-export \-name "My PKCS#12 file" \-out fixed.p12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpkcs8\fR command processes private keys in PKCS#8 format. It can handle
both unencrypted PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo format and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
format with a variety of PKCS#5 (v1.5 and v2.0) and PKCS#12 algorithms.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-topk8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-topk8"
Normally a PKCS#8 private key is expected on input and a traditional format
private key will be written. With the \fB\-topk8\fR option the situation is
reversed: it reads a traditional format private key and writes a PKCS#8
format key.
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. If a PKCS#8 format key is expected on input
then either a \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR or \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR encoded version of a PKCS#8 key will be
expected. Otherwise the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR or \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR format of the traditional format
private key is used.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be
prompted for.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the input file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output by
default. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be
prompted for. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same as the input
filename.
.IP "\fB\-passout arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passout arg"
the output file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-nocrypt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nocrypt"
PKCS#8 keys generated or input are normally PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
structures using an appropriate password based encryption algorithm. With
this option an unencrypted PrivateKeyInfo structure is expected or output.
This option does not encrypt private keys at all and should only be used
when absolutely necessary. Certain software such as some versions of Java
code signing software used unencrypted private keys.
.IP "\fB\-nooct\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nooct"
This option generates \s-1RSA\s0 private keys in a broken format that some software
uses. Specifically the private key should be enclosed in a \s-1OCTET STRING\s0
but some software just includes the structure itself without the
surrounding \s-1OCTET STRING.\s0
.IP "\fB\-embed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-embed"
This option generates \s-1DSA\s0 keys in a broken format. The \s-1DSA\s0 parameters are
embedded inside the PrivateKey structure. In this form the \s-1OCTET STRING\s0
contains an \s-1ASN1 SEQUENCE\s0 consisting of two structures: a \s-1SEQUENCE\s0 containing
the parameters and an \s-1ASN1 INTEGER\s0 containing the private key.
.IP "\fB\-nsdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nsdb"
This option generates \s-1DSA\s0 keys in a broken format compatible with Netscape
private key databases. The PrivateKey contains a \s-1SEQUENCE\s0 consisting of
the public and private keys respectively.
.IP "\fB\-v2 alg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v2 alg"
This option enables the use of PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms. Normally PKCS#8
private keys are encrypted with the password based encryption algorithm
called \fBpbeWithMD5AndDES\-CBC\fR this uses 56 bit \s-1DES\s0 encryption but it
was the strongest encryption algorithm supported in PKCS#5 v1.5. Using 
the \fB\-v2\fR option PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms are used which can use any
encryption algorithm such as 168 bit triple \s-1DES\s0 or 128 bit \s-1RC2\s0 however
not many implementations support PKCS#5 v2.0 yet. If you are just using
private keys with OpenSSL then this doesn't matter.
.Sp
The \fBalg\fR argument is the encryption algorithm to use, valid values include
\&\fBdes\fR, \fBdes3\fR and \fBrc2\fR. It is recommended that \fBdes3\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-v1 alg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v1 alg"
This option specifies a PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 algorithm to use. A complete
list of possible algorithms is included below.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The encrypted form of a \s-1PEM\s0 encode PKCS#8 files uses the following
headers and footers:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
The unencrypted form uses:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
Private keys encrypted using PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms and high iteration
counts are more secure that those encrypted using the traditional
SSLeay compatible formats. So if additional security is considered
important the keys should be converted.
.PP
The default encryption is only 56 bits because this is the encryption
that most current implementations of PKCS#8 will support.
.PP
Some software may use PKCS#12 password based encryption algorithms
with PKCS#8 format private keys: these are handled automatically
but there is no option to produce them.
.PP
It is possible to write out \s-1DER\s0 encoded encrypted private keys in
PKCS#8 format because the encryption details are included at an \s-1ASN1\s0
level whereas the traditional format includes them at a \s-1PEM\s0 level.
.SH "PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#12 algorithms."
.IX Header "PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#12 algorithms."
Various algorithms can be used with the \fB\-v1\fR command line option,
including PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#12. These are described in more detail
below.
.IP "\fB\s-1PBE\-MD2\-DES PBE\-MD5\-DES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "PBE-MD2-DES PBE-MD5-DES"
These algorithms were included in the original PKCS#5 v1.5 specification.
They only offer 56 bits of protection since they both use \s-1DES.\s0
.IP "\fB\s-1PBE\-SHA1\-RC2\-64 PBE\-MD2\-RC2\-64 PBE\-MD5\-RC2\-64 PBE\-SHA1\-DES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "PBE-SHA1-RC2-64 PBE-MD2-RC2-64 PBE-MD5-RC2-64 PBE-SHA1-DES"
These algorithms are not mentioned in the original PKCS#5 v1.5 specification
but they use the same key derivation algorithm and are supported by some
software. They are mentioned in PKCS#5 v2.0. They use either 64 bit \s-1RC2\s0 or
56 bit \s-1DES.\s0
.IP "\fB\s-1PBE\-SHA1\-RC4\-128 PBE\-SHA1\-RC4\-40 PBE\-SHA1\-3DES PBE\-SHA1\-2DES PBE\-SHA1\-RC2\-128 PBE\-SHA1\-RC2\-40\s0\fR" 4

These algorithms use the PKCS#12 password based encryption algorithm and
allow strong encryption algorithms like triple \s-1DES\s0 or 128 bit \s-1RC2\s0 to be used.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.SH "STANDARDS"
.IX Header "STANDARDS"
Test vectors from this PKCS#5 v2.0 implementation were posted to the
pkcs-tng mailing list using triple \s-1DES, DES\s0 and \s-1RC2\s0 with high iteration
counts, several people confirmed that they could decrypt the private
keys produced and Therefore it can be assumed that the PKCS#5 v2.0
implementation is reasonably accurate at least as far as these
algorithms are concerned.
.PP
The format of PKCS#8 \s-1DSA \s0(and other) private keys is not well documented:
it is hidden away in PKCS#11 v2.01, section 11.9. OpenSSL's default \s-1DSA\s0
PKCS#8 private key format complies with this standard.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
There should be an option that prints out the encryption algorithm
in use and other details such as the iteration count.
.PP
PKCS#8 using triple \s-1DES\s0 and PKCS#5 v2.0 should be the default private
key format for OpenSSL: for compatibility several of the utilities use
the old format at present.

.\"																				DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A 
.Dq component package
contains payload to be installed by the OS X Installer. Although a component package
can be installed on its own, it is typically incorporated into a product archive,
along with a
.Dq distribution
and localized resources, using
.Xr productbuild 1 .
.Pp
.Em To create a product archive for submission to the Mac App Store,
do not use 
.Nm .
Instead, use
.Xr productbuild 1
directly.
.Pp
.Nm
has three different modes, as shown in the 
.Sx SYNOPSIS
above:
.Bl -enum
.It
.Em Package a complete destination root.
When you use
.Xr xcodebuild 1
with the
.Em install
action, the result is a destination root, either under
.Pa /tmp ,
or in whatever location you specify with the Xcode
.Ev DSTROOT
setting. Use the
.Cm --root
option to specify that destination root directory to
.Nm ,
and the entire contents of the directory tree will be included in the output package.
.It
.Em Create a template component property list (analyze mode).
You point
.Nm
to a destination root as above, but instead of outputting a package,
.Nm
outputs a component property list (see
.Sx COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST ) .
By editing this property list and specifying it with
.Cm --component-plist
when you subsequently build the package, you can control bundle-specific Installer behavior.
.It
.Em Package one or more individual bundles.
If you don't have a destination root, you can use the
.Cm --component
option to specify one or more bundles that should be incorporated into the package.
Note that only
.Sy bundles
can be specified with
.Cm --component .
.El
.\"																				OPTIONS 
.Sh ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Cm --root Ar root-path
Package the entire contents of the directory tree at
.Ar root-path ,
typically a destination root created by 
.Xr xcodebuild 1 .
.It Cm --component Ar component-path
The bundle at
.Ar component-path
is added to the package. Valid only if you don't use
.Cm --root .
.It Cm --component-plist Ar plist-path
If you specify
.Cm --root ,
you can use 
.Cm --component-plist
to identity the bundles within that destination root, and control how the OS X Installer
handles those bundles. See more at
.Sx COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST .
If you add bundles and need to update your component property list, you can specify the
old version with 
.Cm --component-plist
when running
.Nm
with 
.Cm --analyze ,
and the old settings will be propagated to the output for still-extant bundles.
.It Cm --scripts Ar scripts-path
Archive the entire contents of
.Ar scripts-path
as the package scripts. If this directory contains scripts named 
.Pa preinstall
and/or
.Pa postinstall ,
these will be run as the top-level scripts of the package. If you want to run scripts for
specific bundles, you must specify those in a component property list; see more at
.Sx COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST .
Any other files under
.Ar scripts-path
will be used only if the top-level or component-specific scripts invoke them.
.It Cm --nopayload
Indicates that the package will contain only scripts, with no payload.
.It Cm --identifier Ar pkg-identifier
Specify a unique identifier for this package. The OS X Installer recognizes a package
as being an upgrade to an already-installed package only if the package identifiers match,
so it is advisable to set a meaningful, consistent identifier when you build the package.
.Nm
will infer an identifier when building a package from a single component, but will fail
otherwise if the identifier has not been set.
.It Cm --version Ar pkg-version
Specify a version for the package. Packages with the same identifier are compared using
this version, to determine if the package is an upgrade or downgrade. If you don't specify
a version, a default of zero is assumed, but this may prevent proper upgrade/downgrade checking.
.It Cm --install-location Ar install-path
Specify the default install location for the contents of the package. For example, if
you specify a single application component, you might specify an 
.Ar install-path
of
.Pa /Applications .
.Nm
attempts to infer a sensible install path if this option is not used, but it may not
choose correctly. Note that whether or not the default install location is actually used
by the OS X Installer depends on the distribution file you deploy with the package.
.It Cm --analyze
Instead of creating a package, create a template component property list from the destination root given with
.Cm --root .
See
.Sx COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST .
.It Cm --prior Ar pkg-path
In addition to the options above, you can also set the package identifier, version and install location 
by pointing to a prior version of the same package. 
.Nm
will read the package at
.Ar pkg-path
and use the same package identifier and install location contained therein. The version
number in the prior package will be converted to an integer and incremented, and the result
used for the new package. Note that
.Nm
makes no attempt to verify that the prior package is in any way equivalent to the one being
built, so you must make sure you point it to a logically equivalent package.
.It Cm --filter Ar filter-expression
By default,
.Cm --root
will include the entire contents of the given
.Ar root-path
in the package payload, except for any
.Pa .svn
or
.Pa CVS
directories, and any
.Pa .DS_Store
files. You can override these default filters by specifying one or more
.Cm --filter
options. Each
.Ar filter-expression
is an
.Xr re_format 7
.Dq extended 
expression: any path in the root which matches any of the given expressions will be 
excluded from the package payload. (Note that specifying even one
.Cm --filter
inhibits the default filters, so you must respecify the default filters if you
still want them to be used.)
.It Cm --ownership ( Li recommended | Li preserve | Li preserve-other )
By default, when the payload is archived into the package, the recommended UID and GID
will be applied to all files. (Generally, this will be root:wheel, which ensures that
files installed in the system domain are root-owned, while files installed in the user
home directory will be owned by that user.) If you have special ownership requirements,
you should use
.Xr chmod 1
to adjust the ownership of the source files, and use
.Cm --ownership preserve
so that 
.Nm
archives the exact ownership of the on-disk files. Alternatively, if you have just a few
files to adjust,
.Cm --ownership preserve-other
will apply the recommended UID and GID to those files that are owned by the user running
.Nm ,
but leave other files unchanged. Note that
.Nm
never changes the ownership of the actual on-disk files, only the ownership that is
archived into the package.
.It Cm --sign Ar identity-name
Adds a digital signature to the resulting package. See
.Sx SIGNED PACKAGES
.It Cm --keychain Ar keychain-path
Specify a specific keychain to search for the signing identity. See

.It Cm --timestamp
Include a trusted timestamp with the signature. See

.It Cm --timestamp=none
Disable trusted timestamp, regardless of identity. See
.Sx SIGNED_PACKAGES
.It Cm --quiet
Inhibits status messages on stdout. Any error messages are still sent to stderr.

When
.Cm --analyze
is used, the path to which the template component property list will be written.

.Pp
.\"																				COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST 
.Sh COMPONENT PROPERTY LIST
When you package a destination root, you can use a component property list to
specify how bundles in that root should be handled by the OS X Installer. This property
list should be an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies a single bundle. The
dictionary keys are as follows:
.Bl -column ".Sy BundlePostInstallScriptPath" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy Key Ta Sy Description
.It Sy RootRelativeBundlePath Ta "Path to bundle relative to the destination root (string)"
.It Sy BundleIsRelocatable Ta "Install bundle over previous version if moved by user? (bool)"
.It Sy BundleIsVersionChecked Ta "Don't install bundle if newer version on disk? (bool)"
.It Sy BundleHasStrictIdentifier Ta "Require identical bundle identifiers at install path? (bool)" 
.It Sy BundleOverwriteAction Ta "How to treat existing on-disk version of bundle (string)" 
.It Sy BundlePreInstallScriptPath Ta "Relative path to bundle-specific preinstall script"
.It Sy BundlePostInstallScriptPath Ta "Relative path to bundle-specific postinstall script"
.It Sy ChildBundles Ta "Bundles under this bundle (array of dictionaries)"
.El
.Pp
The easiest way to create a component property list is to use the 
.Cm --analyze
option and point 
.Nm
at your current destination root. The output will be a component property list with default
attributes, which you can then edit as needed. You can also specify a previous version of
your component property list when using
.Cm --analyze ,
which will cause the attributes of previously existing bundles to be propagated forward.
.Pp
.Sy BundleOverwriteAction
specifies how an existing version of the bundle on disk should be handled when the version in
the package is installed. If you specify
.Ar upgrade ,
the bundle in the package atomically replaces any version on disk; this has the effect of 
deleting old paths that no longer exist in the new version of the bundle.
If you specify
.Ar update ,
the bundle in the package overwrites the version on disk, and any files not contained in the
package will be left intact; this is appropriate when you are delivering an update-only package.
Another effect of 
.Ar update
is that the package bundle will not be installed at all if there is not already a version on disk;
this allows a package to deliver an update for an app that the user might have deleted.
.Pp
.Sy BundlePreInstallScriptPath
and
.Sy BundlePostInstallScriptPath
are meaningful only if 
.Cm --scripts
was used to specify a scripts directory. The paths given by these keys must be relative to
the scripts directory.
.Pp
.Sy ChildBundles
can be used to represent nesting of bundles, but it does not change the meaning of 
.Sy RootRelativeBundlePath
within lower-level dictionaries (i.e. it is always relative to the destination root).
If you write a component property list manually, you do not need to use
.Sy ChildBundles
at all; you can simply put all bundle dictionaries in the top-level array.
.\"																				SIGNED PACKAGES 
.Sh SIGNED PACKAGES
When creating a package, you can optionally add a digital signature to the package.
You will need to have a certificate and corresponding private key -- together called an
.Dq identity
-- in one of your accessible keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the identity using the
.Cm --sign
option. The identity's name is the same as the
.Dq Common Name
of the certificate.
.Pp
If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify the path to the
keychain file using the 
.Cm --keychain
option. Otherwise, the default keychain search path is used.
.Pp
.Nm
will embed the signing certificate in the product archive, as well as any intermediate
certificates that are found in the keychain. If you need to embed additional certificates
to form a chain of trust between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate
on the system, use the
.Cm --cert
option to give the Common Name of the intermediate certificate. Multiple
.Cm --cert
options may be used to embed multiple intermediate certificates.
.Pp
The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled by default when signing with
a Developer ID identity, but it can be enabled explicitly using the
.Cm --timestamp 
option. A timestamp server must be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't
connected to the Internet, you can use
.Cm --timestamp=none
to disable timestamps, even for a Developer ID identity.
.Pp
Note that if you are going to create a signed product with the resulting package, using
.Xr productbuild 1 ,
there is no reason to sign the individual package.

The equal sign (=) is \fBrequired\fP or the search string will be ignored and all package IDs will be returned.
Be mindful of escaping characters in both your shell and the regular expression.
(Eg, 'pkgutil --pkgs=\\\\.D' searches for package IDs matching the literal '.D' after escaping the backslash
from your shell and then the dot from the regex to make it literal.) Regular expressions are more
complex than simple shell globbing. A dot (.) matches any character, while '*' matches zero or more of the previous
character. See
.Xr re_format 7
for a complete description of the syntax.
.It Cm --files Ar package-id
List all of the files installed under the \fIpackage-id\fP.
.It Cm --export-plist Ar package-id

may contain no BOM, one BOM, or several BOMs.
.It Cm --payload-files Ar path
List the files archived within the payload of the uninstalled flat package(s) contained at \fIpath\fP.
This should be equivilant to "lsbom -s `pkgutil --bom \fIpath\fP`". Note that flat package

command searches the process table on the running system and prints the
process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on the command
line.
.Pp
The
.Nm pkill
command searches the process table on the running system and signals all
processes that match the criteria given on the command line.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl F Ar pidfile"
.It Fl F Ar pidfile
Restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
.Ar pidfile
file.
.It Fl G Ar gid
Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar gid .
.It Fl I
Request confirmation before attempting to signal each process.
.It Fl L
The
.Ar pidfile
file given for the
.Fl F
option must be locked with the
.Xr flock 2
syscall or created with
.Xr pidfile 3 .
.It Fl P Ar ppid
Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar ppid .
.It Fl U Ar uid
Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar uid .
.It Fl d Ar delim
Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process ID.
The default is a newline.
This option can only be used with the
.Nm pgrep
command.
.It Fl a
Include process ancestors in the match list.
By default, the current
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
process and all of its ancestors are excluded (unless
.Fl v
is used).
.It Fl f
Match against full argument lists.
The default is to match against process names.
.It Fl g Ar pgrp
Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar pgrp .
The value zero is taken to mean the process group ID of the running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
command.
.It Fl i
Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and the supplied pattern.
.It Fl l
Long output.
For
.Nm pgrep ,
print the process name in addition to the process ID for each matching
process.
If used in conjunction with
.Fl f ,
print the process ID and the full argument list for each matching process.
For
.Nm pkill ,
display the kill command used for each process killed.
.It Fl n
Select only the newest (most recently started) of the matching processes.
.It Fl o
Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the matching processes.
.It Fl q
Do not write anything to standard output.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Restrict matches to processes associated with a terminal in the
comma-separated list
.Ar tty .
Terminal names may be of the form
.Pa tty Ns Ar xx
or the shortened form
.Ar xx .
A single dash
.Pq Ql -
matches processes not associated with a terminal.
.It Fl u Ar euid
Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar euid .
.It Fl v
Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes that do not match the
given criteria.
.It Fl x
Require an exact match of the process name, or argument list if
.Fl f
is given.
The default is to match any substring.
.It Fl Ns Ar signal
A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name specifying the signal
to be sent instead of the default
.Dv TERM .
This option is valid only when given as the first argument to
.Nm pkill .
.El
.Pp
If any
.Ar pattern
operands are specified, they are used as regular expressions to match
the command name or full argument list of each process.
.Pp
Note that a running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
process will never consider itself as
a potential match.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm pgrep
and
.Nm pkill
utilities
return one of the following values upon exit:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
One or more processes were matched.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to check the syntax of property list files, or convert a plist file from one format to another.  Specifying - as an input file reads from stdin.
.Pp
The first argument indicates the operation to perform, one of:
.Bl -tag -width "-convert fmt"
.It Fl help
Show the usage information for the command and exit.
.It Fl p
Print the property list in a human-readable fashion. The output format is not stable and not designed for machine parsing. The purpose of this command is to be able to easily read the contents of a plist file, no matter what format it is in.
.It Fl lint
Check the named property list files for syntax errors.
This is the default command option if none is specified.
.It Fl convert Ar fmt
Convert the named 
.Ar file
to the indicated format and write back to the file system.  If the file can't be loaded due to invalid syntax, the operation fails.
.Bl -tag -width "fmt is one of:"
.It \fIfmt\fR is one of: 
.Sy xml1 ,
for version 1 of the XML plist format
.Sy binary1 ,
for version 1 of the binary plist format
.Sy json ,

.El
.El
.Pp
There are a few additional options:
.Bl -tag -width "-e extension"
.It Fl -
Specifies that all further arguments are file names
.It Fl s
Don't print anything on success.
.It Fl r
For JSON, add whitespace and indentation to make the output more human-readable.
.It Fl o Ar path
Specify an alternate path name for the result of the -convert operation; this option is only useful with a single file to be converted.  Specifying - as the path outputs to stdout.
.It Fl e Ar extension
Specify an alternate extension for converted files, and the output file names are otherwise the same.
.El
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
command exits 0 on success, and 1 on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO 
.Xr plist 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The 
.Nm
command obeys no one's rules but its own.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in Mac OS X 10.2.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages power management settings such as idle sleep timing, wake on administrative access, automatic restart on power loss, etc.
.Pp
Note that processes may dynamically override these power management settings by using
I/O Kit power assertions.
Whenever processes override any system power settings,
.Nm
will list those processes and their power assertions in
.Fl g
and
.Fl g 
assertions. See 
.Xr caffeinate 8 .
.Sh SETTING
.Nm
can modify the values of any of the power management settings defined below. You may specify one or more setting & value pairs on the command-line invocation of pmset.
The
.Fl a,
.Fl b,
.Fl c,
.Fl u
flags determine whether the settings apply to battery (
.Fl b
),
charger (wall power) (
.Fl c
), UPS (
.Fl u
) or all (
.Fl a
).
.Pp
Use a minutes argument of 0 to set the idle time to never for
.Ar sleep
.Ar disksleep
and
.Ar displaysleep
.
.Pp
.Nm
must be run as root in order to modify any settings.
.Sh SETTINGS

.Sh SAFE SLEEP ARGUMENTS
.Ar hibernatemode
supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hibernation image gets written is also dependent on the values of
.Ar standby
and
.Ar autopoweroff
.Pp
For example, on desktops that support
.Ar standby
a hibernation image will be written after the specified
.Ar standbydelay
time. To disable hibernation images completely, ensure
.Ar hibernatemode
.Ar standby
and
.Ar autopoweroff
are all set to 0.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
= 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
= 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode
= 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.
.Pp
Please note that
.Ar hibernatefile
may only point to a file located on the root volume.
.Sh STANDBY ARGUMENTS
.Ar standby
causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to
.Ar ON
for supported hardware. The setting
.Ar standby
will be visible in
.Nm
.Fl g
if the feature is supported on this machine.
.Pp
.Ar standbydelay
specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.

.Ar autopoweroff
is enabled by default on supported platforms as an implementation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for <autopoweroffdelay> seconds, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep.
.Pp
.Ar autopoweroffdelay
specifies the delay, in seconds, before entering autopoweroff mode.
.Sh UPS SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS
.br
UPS-specific arguments are only valid following the 
.Fl u 
option. UPS settings also have an on/off value. Use a -1 argument instead of percent 
or minutes to turn any of these settings off. If multiple halt conditions are specified,
the system will halt on the first condition that occurs in a low power situation.
.Pp
.Ar haltlevel
- when draining UPS battery, battery level at which to trigger an emergency shutdown (value in %)
.br
.Ar haltafter
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown after this long running on UPS power (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.br
.Ar haltremain
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown when this much time remaining on UPS power is estimated (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.Pp
Note: None of these settings are observed on a system with support for an internal battery, such as a laptop. UPS emergency shutdown settings are for desktop and server only.
.Sh SCHEDULED EVENT ARGUMENTS
.br
pmset allows you to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup and/or power on. "schedule"
is for setting up one-time power events, and "repeat" is for setting up daily/weekly 
power on and power off events. Note that you may only have one pair of repeating events
scheduled - a "power on" event and a "power off" event. For sleep cycling applications,
pmset can schedule a "relative" wakeup to occur in seconds from the end of system sleep,
but this event cannot be cancelled and is inherently imprecise.
.Pp
.Ar type 
- one of sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron
.br
.Ar date/time
- "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" (in 24 hour format; must be in quotes)
.br
.Ar time 
- HH:mm:ss
.br
.Ar weekdays
- a subset of MTWRFSU ("M" and "MTWRF" are valid strings)
.br
.Ar owner 
- a string describing the person or program who is scheduling this one-time power event (optional)
.Sh POWER SOURCE ARGUMENTS
.Fl g 
with a 'batt' or 'ps' argument will show the state of all attached power sources.
.Pp
.Fl g 
with a 'pslog' or 'rawlog' argument is normally used for debugging, such as isolating
a problem with an aging battery.
.Sh OTHER ARGUMENTS
.Ar boot 
- tell the kernel that system boot is complete (normally LoginWindow does this). May be useful to Darwin users.
.br
.Ar force 
- tells PM to immediately activate these settings. Does not write them to disk, and the settings may easily be overwritten. Useful in circumstances where PM's configd plugin happens not to be running.
.br
.Ar touch
- PM re-reads existing settings from disk.
.br
.Ar noidle
- pmset prevents idle sleep by creating a PM assertion to prevent idle sleep(while running; hit ctrl-c to cancel). This argument is deprecated in favor of 
.Xr caffeinate 8 . Please use 
.Xr caffeinate 8 instead.
.br
.Ar sleepnow
- causes an immediate system sleep.
.br
.Ar restoredefaults
- Restores Energy Saver settings to their default values. (Like clicking "Restore Defaults" in Energy Saver GUI).
.br
.Ar displaysleepnow
- causes display to go to sleep immediately.
.br
.Ar resetdisplayambientparams
- resets the ambient light parameters for certain Apple displays.
.br
.Ar dim 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'displaysleep'. 'dim' will continue to work.
.br
.Ar spindown 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'disksleep'. 'spindown' will continue to work.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This command sets displaysleep to a 5 minute timer on battery power, leaving
other settings on battery power and other power sources unperturbed.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl b

.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 40%.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl u
haltlevel 40
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 25%, or when the
UPS estimates it has less than 30 minutes remaining runtime. The system shuts down
as soon as either of these conditions is met.
.Pp
.Nm

Creates a complete \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR file that can be processed immediately
(unless \f(CW\*(C`=for/=begin\*(C'\fR directives are used that rely on extra packages).
Table of contents and index generation commands are included in the

that the description of a module will be in its own section

Also forces \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR label and index entries to be prefixed by the

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`pod2latex\*(C'\fR is a program to convert \s-1POD\s0 format documentation
(perlpod) into latex. It can process multiple input documents at a
time and either generate a latex file per input document or a single
combined output file.
.SH "OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS"
This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum
matching is supported.
.IP "\fB\-out\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out"
Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input pods
it is assumed that the intention is to write all translated output
into a single file. \f(CW\*(C`.tex\*(C'\fR is appended if not present.  If the
argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for each
input file.
.IP "\fB\-full\fR" 4
.IX Item "-full"
Creates a complete \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR file that can be processed immediately
(unless \f(CW\*(C`=for/=begin\*(C'\fR directives are used that rely on extra packages).
Table of contents and index generation commands are included in the
wrapper \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR code.
.IP "\fB\-sections\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sections"
Specify pod sections to include (or remove if negated) in the
translation.  See \*(L"\s-1SECTION SPECIFICATIONS\*(R"\s0 in Pod::Select for the
format to use for \fIsection-spec\fR. This option may be given multiple
times on the command line.This is identical to the similar option in
the \f(CW\*(C`podselect()\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-modify\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modify"
This option causes the output \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR to be slightly
modified from the input pod such that when a \f(CW\*(C`=head1 NAME\*(C'\fR
is encountered a section is created containing the actual
pod name (rather than \fB\s-1NAME\s0\fR) and all subsequent \f(CW\*(C`=head1\*(C'\fR
directives are treated as subsections. This has the advantage
that the description of a module will be in its own section
which is helpful for including module descriptions in documentation.
Also forces \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR label and index entries to be prefixed by the
name of the module.
.IP "\fB\-h1level\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h1level"
Specifies the \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR section that is equivalent to a \f(CW\*(C`H1\*(C'\fR pod
directive. This is an integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a
\&\f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR chapter, 1 equivalent to a \f(CW\*(C`latex\*(C'\fR section etc. The default
is 1 (\f(CW\*(C`H1\*(C'\fR equivalent to a latex section).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Print a brief help message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "-man"
Print the manual page and exit.
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
Print information messages as each document is processed.
.IP "\fB\-preamble\fR" 4
.IX Item "-preamble"
A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values
are supported and appended in order separated by \*(L"\en\*(R".
See \fB\-prefile\fR for reading the preamble from a file.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBpod2man\fR is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
from \s-1POD\s0 source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
terminal using \fInroff\fR\|(1), normally via \fIman\fR\|(1), or printing using \fItroff\fR\|(1).
.PP
\&\fIinput\fR is the file to read for \s-1POD\s0 source (the \s-1POD\s0 can be embedded in
code).  If \fIinput\fR isn't given, it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.  \fIoutput\fR, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If \fIoutput\fR
isn't given, the formatted output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR.  Several \s-1POD\s0
files can be processed in the same \fBpod2man\fR invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of \fIinput\fR and
\&\fIoutput\fR files on the command line.
.PP
\&\fB\-\-section\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR, \fB\-\-center\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR, and \fB\-\-official\fR can
be used to set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will
assume various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.
.PP
\&\fBpod2man\fR assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
named \f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  If yours is called something else (like \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR), use
\&\fB\-\-fixed\fR to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output
for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
bold italic fixed-width output.
.PP
Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
takes care of formatting \fIfunc()\fR, func(n), and simple variable references
like \f(CW$foo\fR or \f(CW@bar\fR so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
expressions like \f(CW$fred{\*(Aqstuff\*(Aq}\fR will still need to be escaped, though.
It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes
long dashes\*(--like this\*(--into proper em dashes, fixes \*(L"paired quotes,\*(R" and
takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See Pod::Man for
complete information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIstring\fR, \fB\-\-center\fR=\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c string, --center=string"
Sets the centered page header to \fIstring\fR.  The default is \*(L"User
Contributed Perl Documentation\*(R", but also see \fB\-\-official\fR below.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIstring\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR=\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d string, --date=string"
Set the left-hand footer string to this value.  By default, the modification
date of the input file will be used, or the current date if input comes from
\&\f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-errors\fR=\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-errors=style"
Set the error handling style.  \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR says to throw an exception on any
\&\s-1POD\s0 formatting error.  \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR says to report errors on standard error,
but not to throw an exception.  \f(CW\*(C`pod\*(C'\fR says to include a \s-1POD ERRORS\s0
section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
ignores \s-1POD\s0 errors entirely, as much as possible.
.Sp
The default is \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixed\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixed=font"
The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  Some systems may want \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR instead.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1)
output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbold\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbold=font"
Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixeditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixeditalic=font"
Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CI\*(C'\fR.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbolditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbolditalic=font"
Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as \f(CW\*(C`CX\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print out usage information.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lax\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --lax"
No longer used.  \fBpod2man\fR used to check its input for validity as a
manual page, but this should now be done by \fIpodchecker\fR\|(1) instead.
Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does anything.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR \fIname\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n name, --name=name"
Set the name of the manual page to \fIname\fR.  Without this option, the manual
name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless
the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a
Perl module path.  If it is, a path like \f(CW\*(C`.../lib/Pod/Man.pm\*(C'\fR is converted
into a name like \f(CW\*(C`Pod::Man\*(C'\fR.  This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name.
.Sp
Note that this option is probably not useful when converting multiple \s-1POD\s0
files at once.  The convention for Unix man pages for commands is for the
man page title to be in all-uppercase even if the command isn't.
.IP "\fB\-\-nourls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--nourls"
Normally, L<> formatting codes with a \s-1URL\s0 but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the \s-1URL. \s0 In other words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    L<foo|http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
is formatted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo <http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
This flag, if given, suppresses the \s-1URL\s0 when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-official\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --official"
Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the standard
Perl release, if \fB\-\-center\fR is not also given.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIquotes\fR, \fB\-\-quotes\fR=\fIquotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q quotes, --quotes=quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to \fIquotes\fR.  If
\&\fIquotes\fR is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote; if \fIquotes\fR is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if \fIquotes\fR is four
characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as
the right quote.
.Sp
\&\fIquotes\fR may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no
quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still changed for
troff output).
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --release"
Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run
\&\fBpod2man\fR under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the
centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like
\&\*(L"Last modified: \*(R"; if this is the case, you may want to set \fB\-\-release\fR to
the last modified date and \fB\-\-date\fR to the version number.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --section"
Set the section for the \f(CW\*(C`.TH\*(C'\fR macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.
.Sp
By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR, in
which case section 3 will be selected.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stderr"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR dies if any errors are detected in the \s-1POD\s0 input.
If \fB\-\-stderr\fR is given and no \fB\-\-errors\fR flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but \fBpod2man\fR does not abort.  This is equivalent
to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=stderr\*(C'\fR and is supported for backward compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --utf8"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR produces the most conservative possible *roff
output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
character (at least for troff output) or to \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This option says to instead output literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters.  If your
*roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use
and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
However, be warned that *roff source with literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters is not
supported by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and
other bad behavior.
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a \f(CW\*(C`POD ERRORS\*(C'\fR section generated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=pod\*(C'\fR), \fBpod2man\fR will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, \fBpod2man\fR
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a \s-1POD\s0 document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \fBpod2man\fR will abort immediately with exit status 255.

If \fBpod2man\fR fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for
information about what those errors might mean.

If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you probably
want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page numbering and
even/odd paging, at least on some versions of \fIman\fR\|(7).

The indexing merely outputs messages via \f(CW\*(C`.tm\*(C'\fR for each major page,

load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of \fIinput\fR and
\&\fIoutput\fR files on the command line.
.PP
\&\fB\-\-section\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR, \fB\-\-center\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR, and \fB\-\-official\fR can
be used to set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will
assume various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.
.PP
\&\fBpod2man\fR assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
named \f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  If yours is called something else (like \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR), use
\&\fB\-\-fixed\fR to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output
for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
bold italic fixed-width output.
.PP
Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
takes care of formatting \fIfunc()\fR, func(n), and simple variable references
like \f(CW$foo\fR or \f(CW@bar\fR so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
expressions like \f(CW$fred{\*(Aqstuff\*(Aq}\fR will still need to be escaped, though.
It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes
long dashes\*(--like this\*(--into proper em dashes, fixes \*(L"paired quotes,\*(R" and
takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See Pod::Man for
complete information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIstring\fR, \fB\-\-center\fR=\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c string, --center=string"
Sets the centered page header to \fIstring\fR.  The default is \*(L"User
Contributed Perl Documentation\*(R", but also see \fB\-\-official\fR below.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIstring\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR=\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d string, --date=string"
Set the left-hand footer string to this value.  By default, the modification
date of the input file will be used, or the current date if input comes from
\&\f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixed\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixed=font"
The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  Some systems may want \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR instead.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1)
output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbold\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbold=font"
Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixeditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixeditalic=font"
Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CI\*(C'\fR.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbolditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbolditalic=font"
Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as \f(CW\*(C`CX\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print out usage information.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lax\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --lax"
No longer used.  \fBpod2man\fR used to check its input for validity as a
manual page, but this should now be done by \fIpodchecker\fR\|(1) instead.
Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does anything.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR \fIname\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n name, --name=name"
Set the name of the manual page to \fIname\fR.  Without this option, the manual
name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless
the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a
Perl module path.  If it is, a path like \f(CW\*(C`.../lib/Pod/Man.pm\*(C'\fR is converted
into a name like \f(CW\*(C`Pod::Man\*(C'\fR.  This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name.
.Sp
Note that this option is probably not useful when converting multiple \s-1POD\s0
files at once.  The convention for Unix man pages for commands is for the
man page title to be in all-uppercase even if the command isn't.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-official\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --official"
Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the standard
Perl release, if \fB\-\-center\fR is not also given.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIquotes\fR, \fB\-\-quotes\fR=\fIquotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q quotes, --quotes=quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to \fIquotes\fR.  If
\&\fIquotes\fR is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote; if \fIquotes\fR is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if \fIquotes\fR is four
characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as
the right quote.
.Sp
\&\fIquotes\fR may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no
quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still changed for
troff output).
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --release"
Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run
\&\fBpod2man\fR under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the
centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like
\&\*(L"Last modified: \*(R"; if this is the case, you may want to set \fB\-\-release\fR to
the last modified date and \fB\-\-date\fR to the version number.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --section"
Set the section for the \f(CW\*(C`.TH\*(C'\fR macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.
.Sp
By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR, in
which case section 3 will be selected.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stderr"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR puts any errors detected in the \s-1POD\s0 input in a \s-1POD\s0
\&\s-1ERRORS\s0 section in the output manual page.  If \fB\-\-stderr\fR is given, errors
are sent to standard error instead and the \s-1POD\s0 \s-1ERRORS\s0 section is
suppressed.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --utf8"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR produces the most conservative possible *roff
output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
character (at least for troff output) or to \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This option says to instead output literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters.  If your
*roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use
and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
However, be warned that *roff source with literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters is not
supported by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and
other bad behavior.
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8\s0, the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBpod2man\fR is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
from \s-1POD\s0 source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
terminal using \fInroff\fR\|(1), normally via \fIman\fR\|(1), or printing using \fItroff\fR\|(1).
.PP
\&\fIinput\fR is the file to read for \s-1POD\s0 source (the \s-1POD\s0 can be embedded in
code).  If \fIinput\fR isn't given, it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.  \fIoutput\fR, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If \fIoutput\fR
isn't given, the formatted output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR.  Several \s-1POD\s0
files can be processed in the same \fBpod2man\fR invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of \fIinput\fR and
\&\fIoutput\fR files on the command line.
.PP
\&\fB\-\-section\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR, \fB\-\-center\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR, and \fB\-\-official\fR can
be used to set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will
assume various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.
.PP
\&\fBpod2man\fR assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
named \f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  If yours is called something else (like \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR), use
\&\fB\-\-fixed\fR to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output
for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
bold italic fixed-width output.
.PP
Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
takes care of formatting \fIfunc()\fR, func(n), and simple variable references
like \f(CW$foo\fR or \f(CW@bar\fR so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
expressions like \f(CW$fred{\*(Aqstuff\*(Aq}\fR will still need to be escaped, though.
It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes
long dashes\*(--like this\*(--into proper em dashes, fixes \*(L"paired quotes,\*(R" and
takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See Pod::Man for
complete information.

\&\f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  Some systems may want \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR instead.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1)
output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbold\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbold=font"
Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixeditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixeditalic=font"
Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CI\*(C'\fR.  Only matters for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-\-fixedbolditalic\fR=\fIfont\fR" 4
.IX Item "--fixedbolditalic=font"
Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as \f(CW\*(C`CX\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fItroff\fR\|(1) output.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print out usage information.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lax\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --lax"
No longer used.  \fBpod2man\fR used to check its input for validity as a
manual page, but this should now be done by \fIpodchecker\fR\|(1) instead.
Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does anything.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR \fIname\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n name, --name=name"
Set the name of the manual page to \fIname\fR.  Without this option, the manual
name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless
the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a
Perl module path.  If it is, a path like \f(CW\*(C`.../lib/Pod/Man.pm\*(C'\fR is converted
into a name like \f(CW\*(C`Pod::Man\*(C'\fR.  This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name.
.Sp
Note that this option is probably not useful when converting multiple \s-1POD\s0
files at once.  The convention for Unix man pages for commands is for the
man page title to be in all-uppercase even if the command isn't.
.IP "\fB\-\-nourls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--nourls"
Normally, L<> formatting codes with a \s-1URL\s0 but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the \s-1URL. \s0 In other words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    L<foo|http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
is formatted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo <http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
This flag, if given, suppresses the \s-1URL\s0 when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-official\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --official"
Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the standard
Perl release, if \fB\-\-center\fR is not also given.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIquotes\fR, \fB\-\-quotes\fR=\fIquotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q quotes, --quotes=quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to \fIquotes\fR.  If
\&\fIquotes\fR is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote; if \fIquotes\fR is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if \fIquotes\fR is four
characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as
the right quote.
.Sp
\&\fIquotes\fR may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no
quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still changed for
troff output).
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-release\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --release"
Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run
\&\fBpod2man\fR under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the
centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like
\&\*(L"Last modified: \*(R"; if this is the case, you may want to set \fB\-\-release\fR to
the last modified date and \fB\-\-date\fR to the version number.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --section"
Set the section for the \f(CW\*(C`.TH\*(C'\fR macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.
.Sp
By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR, in
which case section 3 will be selected.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stderr"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR dies if any errors are detected in the \s-1POD\s0 input.
If \fB\-\-stderr\fR is given and no \fB\-\-errors\fR flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but \fBpod2man\fR does not abort.  This is equivalent
to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=stderr\*(C'\fR and is supported for backward compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --utf8"
By default, \fBpod2man\fR produces the most conservative possible *roff
output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
character (at least for troff output) or to \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This option says to instead output literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters.  If your
*roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use
and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
However, be warned that *roff source with literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters is not
supported by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and
other bad behavior.
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a \f(CW\*(C`POD ERRORS\*(C'\fR section generated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=pod\*(C'\fR), \fBpod2man\fR will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, \fBpod2man\fR
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a \s-1POD\s0 document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \fBpod2man\fR will abort immediately with exit status 255.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
If \fBpod2man\fR fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for
information about what those errors might mean.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.Ve
.PP
If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you probably
want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page numbering and
even/odd paging, at least on some versions of \fIman\fR\|(7).
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
.Vb 1
\&    troff \-man \-rF1 perl.1

.PP
The indexing merely outputs messages via \f(CW\*(C`.tm\*(C'\fR for each major page,
section, subsection, item, and any \f(CW\*(C`X<>\*(C'\fR directives.  See
Pod::Man for more details.

either termcap sequences or \s-1ANSI\s0 color escape sequences to format the text.
.PP
\&\fIinput\fR is the file to read for \s-1POD\s0 source (the \s-1POD\s0 can be embedded in
code).  If \fIinput\fR isn't given, it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.  \fIoutput\fR, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If \fIoutput\fR
isn't given, the formatted output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR.  Several \s-1POD\s0
files can be processed in the same \fBpod2text\fR invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of \fIinput\fR and
\&\fIoutput\fR files on the command line.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --alt"
Use an alternate output format that, among other things, uses a different
heading style and marks \f(CW\*(C`=item\*(C'\fR entries with a colon in the left margin.
.IP "\fB\-\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "--code"
Include any non-POD text from the input file in the output as well.  Useful
for viewing code documented with \s-1POD\s0 blocks with the \s-1POD\s0 rendered and the
code left intact.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --color"
Format the output with \s-1ANSI\s0 color escape sequences.  Using this option
requires that Term::ANSIColor be installed on your system.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIindent\fR, \fB\-\-indent=\fR\fIindent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i indent, --indent=indent"
Set the number of spaces to indent regular text, and the default indentation
for \f(CW\*(C`=over\*(C'\fR blocks.  Defaults to 4 spaces if this option isn't given.
.IP "\fB\-errors\fR=\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-errors=style"
Set the error handling style.  \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR says to throw an exception on any
\&\s-1POD\s0 formatting error.  \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR says to report errors on standard error,
but not to throw an exception.  \f(CW\*(C`pod\*(C'\fR says to include a \s-1POD ERRORS\s0
section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
ignores \s-1POD\s0 errors entirely, as much as possible.
.Sp
The default is \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print out usage information and exit.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-loose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --loose"
Print a blank line after a \f(CW\*(C`=head1\*(C'\fR heading.  Normally, no blank line is
printed after \f(CW\*(C`=head1\*(C'\fR, although one is still printed after \f(CW\*(C`=head2\*(C'\fR,
because this is the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're
formatting arbitrary text documents, using this option is recommended.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\-left\-margin\fR=\fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\-margin\fR=\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m width, --left-margin=width, --margin=width"
The width of the left margin in spaces.  Defaults to 0.  This is the margin
for all text, including headings, not the amount by which regular text is
indented; for the latter, see \fB\-i\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-nourls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--nourls"
Normally, L<> formatting codes with a \s-1URL\s0 but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the \s-1URL. \s0 In other words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    L<foo|http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
is formatted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo <http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
This flag, if given, suppresses the \s-1URL\s0 when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-overstrike\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --overstrike"
Format the output with overstrike printing.  Bold text is rendered as
character, backspace, character.  Italics and file names are rendered as
underscore, backspace, character.  Many pagers, such as \fBless\fR, know how
to convert this to bold or underlined text.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIquotes\fR, \fB\-\-quotes\fR=\fIquotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q quotes, --quotes=quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to \fIquotes\fR.  If
\&\fIquotes\fR is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote; if \fIquotes\fR is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if \fIquotes\fR is four
characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as
the right quote.
.Sp
\&\fIquotes\fR may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no
quote marks are added around C<> text.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sentence\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sentence"
Assume each sentence ends with two spaces and try to preserve that spacing.
Without this option, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs
is compressed into a single space.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stderr"
By default, \fBpod2text\fR dies if any errors are detected in the \s-1POD\s0 input.
If \fB\-\-stderr\fR is given and no \fB\-\-errors\fR flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but \fBpod2text\fR does not abort.  This is
equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=stderr\*(C'\fR and is supported for backward
compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-termcap\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --termcap"
Try to determine the width of the screen and the bold and underline
sequences for the terminal from termcap, and use that information in
formatting the output.  Output will be wrapped at two columns less than the
width of your terminal device.  Using this option requires that your system
have a termcap file somewhere where Term::Cap can find it and requires that
your system support termios.  With this option, the output of \fBpod2text\fR
will contain terminal control sequences for your current terminal type.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --utf8"
By default, \fBpod2text\fR tries to use the same output encoding as its input
encoding (to be backward-compatible with older versions).  This option
says to instead force the output encoding to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-width=\fR\fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w, --width=width, -width"
The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side.  Defaults to 76,
unless \fB\-t\fR is given, in which case it's two columns less than the width of
your terminal device.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a \f(CW\*(C`POD ERRORS\*(C'\fR section generated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=pod\*(C'\fR), \fBpod2text\fR will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, \fBpod2text\fR
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a \s-1POD\s0 document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \fBpod2text\fR will abort immediately with exit status 255.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
If \fBpod2text\fR fails with errors, see Pod::Text and Pod::Simple for
information about what those errors might mean.  Internally, it can also
produce the following diagnostics:
.IP "\-c (\-\-color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed" 4
.IX Item "-c (--color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed"
(F) \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-color\fR were given, but Term::ANSIColor could not be
loaded.
.ie n .IP "Unknown option: %s" 4
.el .IP "Unknown option: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Unknown option: %s"
(F) An unknown command line option was given.
.PP
In addition, other Getopt::Long error messages may result from invalid
command-line options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP "\s-1COLUMNS\s0" 4
.IX Item "COLUMNS"
If \fB\-t\fR is given, \fBpod2text\fR will take the current width of your screen
from this environment variable, if available.  It overrides terminal width
information in \s-1TERMCAP.\s0
.IP "\s-1TERMCAP\s0" 4
.IX Item "TERMCAP"
If \fB\-t\fR is given, \fBpod2text\fR will use the contents of this environment
variable if available to determine the correct formatting sequences for your
current terminal device.

pod2text \fB\-h\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBpod2text\fR is a front-end for Pod::Text and its subclasses.  It uses them
to generate formatted \s-1ASCII\s0 text from \s-1POD\s0 source.  It can optionally use
either termcap sequences or \s-1ANSI\s0 color escape sequences to format the text.
.PP
\&\fIinput\fR is the file to read for \s-1POD\s0 source (the \s-1POD\s0 can be embedded in
code).  If \fIinput\fR isn't given, it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.  \fIoutput\fR, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If \fIoutput\fR
isn't given, the formatted output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR.  Several \s-1POD\s0
files can be processed in the same \fBpod2text\fR invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of \fIinput\fR and
\&\fIoutput\fR files on the command line.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --alt"
Use an alternate output format that, among other things, uses a different
heading style and marks \f(CW\*(C`=item\*(C'\fR entries with a colon in the left margin.
.IP "\fB\-\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "--code"
Include any non-POD text from the input file in the output as well.  Useful
for viewing code documented with \s-1POD\s0 blocks with the \s-1POD\s0 rendered and the
code left intact.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --color"
Format the output with \s-1ANSI\s0 color escape sequences.  Using this option
requires that Term::ANSIColor be installed on your system.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIindent\fR, \fB\-\-indent=\fR\fIindent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i indent, --indent=indent"
Set the number of spaces to indent regular text, and the default indentation
for \f(CW\*(C`=over\*(C'\fR blocks.  Defaults to 4 spaces if this option isn't given.
.IP "\fB\-errors\fR=\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-errors=style"
Set the error handling style.  \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR says to throw an exception on any
\&\s-1POD\s0 formatting error.  \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR says to report errors on standard error,
but not to throw an exception.  \f(CW\*(C`pod\*(C'\fR says to include a \s-1POD ERRORS\s0
section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
ignores \s-1POD\s0 errors entirely, as much as possible.
.Sp
The default is \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print out usage information and exit.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-loose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --loose"
Print a blank line after a \f(CW\*(C`=head1\*(C'\fR heading.  Normally, no blank line is
printed after \f(CW\*(C`=head1\*(C'\fR, although one is still printed after \f(CW\*(C`=head2\*(C'\fR,
because this is the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're
formatting arbitrary text documents, using this option is recommended.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\-left\-margin\fR=\fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\-margin\fR=\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m width, --left-margin=width, --margin=width"
The width of the left margin in spaces.  Defaults to 0.  This is the margin
for all text, including headings, not the amount by which regular text is
indented; for the latter, see \fB\-i\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-nourls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--nourls"
Normally, L<> formatting codes with a \s-1URL\s0 but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the \s-1URL. \s0 In other words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    L<foo|http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
is formatted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo <http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
This flag, if given, suppresses the \s-1URL\s0 when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-overstrike\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --overstrike"
Format the output with overstrike printing.  Bold text is rendered as
character, backspace, character.  Italics and file names are rendered as
underscore, backspace, character.  Many pagers, such as \fBless\fR, know how
to convert this to bold or underlined text.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIquotes\fR, \fB\-\-quotes\fR=\fIquotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q quotes, --quotes=quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to \fIquotes\fR.  If
\&\fIquotes\fR is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote; if \fIquotes\fR is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if \fIquotes\fR is four
characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as
the right quote.
.Sp
\&\fIquotes\fR may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no
quote marks are added around C<> text.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sentence\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sentence"
Assume each sentence ends with two spaces and try to preserve that spacing.
Without this option, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs
is compressed into a single space.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stderr"
By default, \fBpod2text\fR dies if any errors are detected in the \s-1POD\s0 input.
If \fB\-\-stderr\fR is given and no \fB\-\-errors\fR flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but \fBpod2text\fR does not abort.  This is
equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=stderr\*(C'\fR and is supported for backward
compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-termcap\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --termcap"
Try to determine the width of the screen and the bold and underline
sequences for the terminal from termcap, and use that information in
formatting the output.  Output will be wrapped at two columns less than the
width of your terminal device.  Using this option requires that your system
have a termcap file somewhere where Term::Cap can find it and requires that
your system support termios.  With this option, the output of \fBpod2text\fR
will contain terminal control sequences for your current terminal type.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --utf8"
By default, \fBpod2text\fR tries to use the same output encoding as its input
encoding (to be backward-compatible with older versions).  This option
says to instead force the output encoding to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-width=\fR\fIwidth\fR, \fB\-\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w, --width=width, -width"
The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side.  Defaults to 76,
unless \fB\-t\fR is given, in which case it's two columns less than the width of
your terminal device.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a \f(CW\*(C`POD ERRORS\*(C'\fR section generated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors=pod\*(C'\fR), \fBpod2text\fR will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, \fBpod2text\fR
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a \s-1POD\s0 document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \fBpod2text\fR will abort immediately with exit status 255.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
If \fBpod2text\fR fails with errors, see Pod::Text and Pod::Simple for
information about what those errors might mean.  Internally, it can also
produce the following diagnostics:
.IP "\-c (\-\-color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed" 4
.IX Item "-c (--color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed"

.IX Item "Unknown option: %s"
(F) An unknown command line option was given.
.PP
In addition, other Getopt::Long error messages may result from invalid
command-line options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP "\s-1COLUMNS\s0" 4

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B grohtml
front end (which consists of a preprocessor,
.BR pre-grohtml ,
and a device driver,
.BR post-grohtml )
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to html.
Users should always invoke
.B grohtml
via the groff command with a
.B \-Thtml
option.
If no files are given,
.B grohtml
will read the standard input.
A filename of
.B \-
will also cause
.B grohtml
to read the standard input.
Html output is written to the standard output.
When
.B grohtml
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B grohtml
using
.BR groff 's
.B \-P
option.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a aa-text-bits
Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by
.I text
when generating png images.
The default is\~4 but valid values are 0, 1, 2, and\~4.
Note your version of
.B gs
needs to support the
.B \%\-dTextAlphaBits
and
.B \%\-dGraphicAlphaBits
options in order to exploit antialiasing.
A value of\~0 stops
.B grohtml
from issuing antialiasing commands to
.BR gs .
.
.TP
.B \-b
Initialize the background color to white.
.
.TP
.BI \-D dir
Inform
.B grohtml
to place all image files into directory
.IR dir .
.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Prepend directory
.IB dir /dev name
to the search path for font and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR html .
.
.TP
.BI \-g aa-graphic-bits
Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by
.I graphics
when generating png images.
The default is\~4 but valid values are 0, 1, 2, and\~4.
Note your version of
.B gs
needs to support the
.B \%\-dTextAlphaBits
and
.B \%\-dGraphicAlphaBits
options in order to exploit antialiasing.
A value of\~0 stops
.B grohtml
from issuing antialiasing commands to
.BR gs .
.
.TP
.B \-h
Generate section and number headings by using
.BR <B> .\|.\|. </B>
and increasing the font size, rather than using the
.BI <H n >\c
\&.\|.\|.\c
.BI </H n >
tags.
.
.TP
.BI \-i resolution
Select the resolution for all images.
By default this is 100 pixels per inch.
Example:
.B \-i200
indicates 200 pixels per inch.
.
.TP
.BI \-I stem
Determine the image stem name.
If omitted grohtml uses
.BI \%grohtml- XXX
.RI ( XXX
is the process ID).
.
.TP
.BI \-j filename
Inform
.B grohtml
to split the html output into multiple files.
The
.I filename
is the stem and specified section headings
(default is level one) start a new file, named
.IR filename-n.html .
.
.TP
.B \-l
Turn off the production of automatic section links at the top of the
document.
.
.TP
.B \-n
Generate simple heading anchors whenever a section/number heading is found.
Without the option the anchor value is the textual heading.
This can cause problems when a heading contains a `?' on older versions of
some browsers (Netscape).
This flag is automatically turned on if a heading contains an image.
.
.TP
.BI \-o vertical-offset
Specify the vertical offset of images in points.
.
.TP
.B \-p
Display page rendering progress to stderr.
.B grohtml
only displays a page number when an image is required.
.
.TP
.B \-r
Turn off the automatic header and footer line (html rule).
.
.TP
.B \-s size
Set the base point size of the source file.
Thereafter when this point size is used in the source it will correspond
to the html base size.
Every increase of two points in the source will yield a
.B <big>
tag, and conversely when a decrease of two points is seen a
.B <small>
tag is emitted.
.
.TP
.BI \-S level
When splitting html output,
split at the heading level (or higher) defined by
.IR level .
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.
.SH USAGE
There are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to\~4.
.
.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B grohtml
is dependent upon the png utilities
.RB ( \%pnmcut ,
.BR \%pnmcrop ,
.BR \%pnmtopng )
and GhostScript
.RB ( gs ).
.B \%pnmtopng
(version 2.37.6 or greater)
and
.B \%pnmcut
from the netpbm package (version 9.16 or greater) will work also.
It is also dependent upon
.B \%psselect
from the
.B PSUtils
package.
Images are generated whenever a table, picture, equation or line is
encountered.
.
.
.SH BUGS
.B Grohtml
has been completely redesigned and rewritten.
It is still beta code.

Postfix alias database maintenance

\fBpostalias\fR [\fB-Nfinoprsvw\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostalias\fR(1) command creates or queries one or more Postfix
alias databases, or updates an existing one. The input and output
file formats are expected to be compatible with Sendmail version 8,
and are expected to be suitable for the use as NIS alias maps.

If the result files do not exist they will be created with the
same group and other read permissions as their source file.

While a database update is in progress, signal delivery is
postponed, and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on the
entire database, in order to avoid surprises in spectator
processes.

The format of Postfix alias input files is described in
\fBaliases\fR(5).

By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make
the lookups case insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case
folding happens only with tables whose lookup keys are
fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or hash:. With
earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables
where a lookup field can match both upper and lower case
text, such as regexp: and pcre:. This resulted in loss of
information with $\fInumber\fR substitutions.

Options:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP "\fB-d \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and remove one entry per map.
The exit status is zero when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream. The exit status is zero
when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-f\fR
Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while creating or querying
a table.

With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no
effect for regular expression tables. There, case folding
is controlled by appending a flag to a pattern.
.IP \fB-i\fR
Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input and do not
truncate an existing database. By default, \fBpostalias\fR(1) creates
a new database from the entries in \fIfile_name\fR.
.IP \fB-N\fR
Include the terminating null character that terminates lookup keys
and values. By default, \fBpostalias\fR(1) does whatever
is the default for
the host operating system.
.IP \fB-n\fR
Don't include the terminating null character that terminates lookup
keys and values. By default, \fBpostalias\fR(1) does whatever
is the default for
the host operating system.
.IP \fB-o\fR
Do not release root privileges when processing a non-root
input file. By default, \fBpostalias\fR(1) drops root privileges
and runs as the source file owner instead.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Do not inherit the file access permissions from the input file
when creating a new file.  Instead, create a new file with default
access permissions (mode 0644).
.IP "\fB-q \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and write the first value
found to the standard output stream. The exit status is zero
when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream and writes one line of
\fIkey: value\fR output for each key that was found. The exit
status is zero when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-r\fR
When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
existing entries, and make those updates anyway.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of
\fIkey: value\fR output for each element. The elements are
printed in database order, which is not necessarily the same
as the original input order.
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later,
and is not available for all database types.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.IP \fB-w\fR
When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
existing entries, and ignore those attempts.
.PP
Arguments:
.IP \fIfile_type\fR
The database type. To find out what types are supported, use
the "\fBpostconf -m\fR" command.

The \fBpostalias\fR(1) command can query any supported file type,
but it can create only the following file types:
.RS
.IP \fBbtree\fR
The output is a btree file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBcdb\fR
The output is one file named \fIfile_name\fB.cdb\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBcdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBdbm\fR
The output consists of two files, named \fIfile_name\fB.pag\fR and
\fIfile_name\fB.dir\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdbm\fR databases.
.IP \fBhash\fR
The output is a hashed file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBfail\fR
A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup table
name is used for logging only. This table exists to simplify
Postfix error tests.
.IP \fBsdbm\fR
The output consists of two files, named \fIfile_name\fB.pag\fR and
\fIfile_name\fB.dir\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBsdbm\fR databases.
.PP
When no \fIfile_type\fR is specified, the software uses the database
type specified via the \fBdefault_database_type\fR configuration
parameter.
The default value for this parameter depends on the host environment.
.RE
.IP \fIfile_name\fR
The name of the alias database source file when creating a database.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems are logged to the standard error stream and to
\fBsyslogd\fR(8).  No output means that
no problems were detected. Duplicate entries are skipped and are
flagged with a warning.

\fBpostalias\fR(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of success
(including successful "\fBpostalias -q\fR" lookup) and terminates
with non-zero exit status in case of failure.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostcat\fR(1) command prints the contents of the
named \fIfiles\fR in human-readable form. The files are
expected to be in Postfix queue file format. If no \fIfiles\fR
are specified on the command line, the program reads from
standard input.

By default, \fBpostcat\fR(1) shows the envelope and message
content, as if the options \fB-beh\fR were specified. To
view message content only, specify \fB-bh\fR (Postfix 2.7
and later).

Options:
.IP \fB-b\fR
Show body content.  The \fB-b\fR option starts producing
output at the first non-header line, and stops when the end
of the message is reached.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP \fB-d\fR
Print the decimal type of each record.
.IP \fB-e\fR
Show message envelope content.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.
.IP \fB-h\fR
Show message header content.  The \fB-h\fR option produces
output from the beginning of the message up to, but not
including, the first non-header line.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.
.IP \fB-o\fR
Print the queue file offset of each record.
.IP \fB-q\fR
Search the Postfix queue for the named \fIfiles\fR instead
of taking the names literally.

This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

By default, the \fBpostconf\fR(1) command displays the
values of \fBmain.cf\fR configuration parameters, and warns
about possible mis-typed parameter names (Postfix 2.9 and later).
It can also change \fBmain.cf\fR configuration
parameter values, or display other configuration information
about the Postfix mail system.

Options:
.IP \fB-a\fR
List the available SASL server plug-in types.  The SASL
plug-in type is selected with the \fBsmtpd_sasl_type\fR
configuration parameter by specifying one of the names
listed below.
.RS
.IP \fBcyrus\fR
This server plug-in is available when Postfix is built with
Cyrus SASL support.
.IP \fBdovecot\fR
This server plug-in uses the Dovecot authentication server,
and is available when Postfix is built with any form of SASL
support.
.RE
.IP
This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.
.IP \fB-A\fR
List the available SASL client plug-in types.  The SASL
plug-in type is selected with the \fBsmtp_sasl_type\fR or
\fBlmtp_sasl_type\fR configuration parameters by specifying
one of the names listed below.
.RS
.IP \fBcyrus\fR
This client plug-in is available when Postfix is built with
Cyrus SASL support.
.RE
.IP
This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.
.IP "\fB-b\fR [\fItemplate_file\fR]"
Display the message text that appears at the beginning of
delivery status notification (DSN) messages, replacing
$\fBname\fR expressions with actual values as described in
\fBbounce\fR(5).

To override the built-in templates, specify a template file
name at the end of the \fBpostconf\fR(1) command line, or
specify a file name in \fBmain.cf\fR with the
\fBbounce_template_file\fR parameter.

To force selection of the built-in templates, specify an
empty template file name on the \fBpostconf\fR(1) command
line (in shell language: "").

This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP "\fB-C \fIclass,...\fR"
When displaying \fBmain.cf\fR parameters, select only
parameters from the specified class(es):
.RS
.IP \fBbuiltin\fR
Parameters with built-in names.
.IP \fBservice\fR
Parameters with service-defined names (the first field of
a \fBmaster.cf\fR entry plus a Postfix-defined suffix).
.IP \fBuser\fR
Parameters with user-defined names.
.IP \fBall\fR
All the above classes.
.RE
.IP
The default is as if "\fB-C all\fR" is
specified.
.IP \fB-d\fR
Print \fBmain.cf\fR default parameter settings instead of
actual settings.
Specify \fB-df\fR to fold long lines for human readability
(Postfix 2.9 and later).
.IP \fB-e\fR
Edit the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file, and update
parameter settings with the "\fIname=value\fR" pairs on the
\fBpostconf\fR(1) command line.

With \fB-M\fR, edit the \fBmaster.cf\fR configuration file,
and replace one or more service entries with new values as
specified with "\fIservice/type=value\fR" on the \fBpostconf\fR(1)
command line.

With \fB-F\fR, edit the \fBmaster.cf\fR configuration file,
and replace one or more service fields with new values as
specied with "\fIservice/type/field=value\fR" on the
\fBpostconf\fR(1) command line. Currently, the "command"
field contains the command name and command arguments.  this
may change in the near future, so that the "command" field
contains only the command name, and a new "arguments"
pseudofield contains the command arguments.

With \fB-P\fR, edit the \fBmaster.cf\fR configuration file,
and add or update one or more service parameter settings
(-o parameter=value settings) with new values as specied
with "\fIservice/type/parameter=value\fR" on the \fBpostconf\fR(1)
command line.

In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then
renamed into place.  Specify quotes to protect special
characters and whitespace on the \fBpostconf\fR(1) command
line.

The \fB-e\fR option is no longer needed with Postfix version
2.8 and later.
.IP \fB-f\fR

configuration file entries, for human readability.

This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.
.IP \fB-F\fR
Show \fBmaster.cf\fR per-entry field settings (by default
all services and all fields), formatted as one
"\fIservice/type/field=value\fR" per line. Specify \fB-Ff\fR
to fold long lines.

Specify one or more "\fIservice/type/field\fR" instances
on the \fBpostconf\fR(1) command line to limit the output
to fields of interest.  Trailing parameter name or service
type fields that are omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard
fields.

This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.
.IP \fB-h\fR
Show parameter or attribute values without the "\fIname\fR
= " label that normally precedes the value.
.IP \fB-l\fR

\fBpostdrop\fR [\fB-rv\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostdrop\fR(1) command creates a file in the \fBmaildrop\fR
directory and copies its standard input to the file.

Options:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory. See also the
MAIL_CONFIG environment setting below.
.IP \fB-r\fR
Use a Postfix-internal protocol for reading the message from
standard input, and for reporting status information on standard
output. This is currently the only supported method.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix 2.3,
this option is available for the super-user only.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The command is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so
that it can write to the \fBmaildrop\fR queue directory and so that
it can connect to Postfix daemon processes.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Fatal errors: malformed input, I/O error, out of memory. Problems
are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8) and to the standard error stream.
When the input is incomplete, or when the process receives a HUP,
INT, QUIT or TERM signal, the queue file is deleted.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP MAIL_CONFIG
Directory with the \fBmain.cf\fR file. In order to avoid exploitation
of set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed only
if:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The name is listed in the standard \fBmain.cf\fR file with the
\fBalternate_config_directories\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \(bu
The command is invoked by the super-user.

\fBpostfix\fR [\fB-Dv\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR] \fIcommand\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
This command is reserved for the superuser. To submit mail,
use the Postfix \fBsendmail\fR(1) command.

The \fBpostfix\fR(1) command controls the operation of the Postfix
mail system: start or stop the \fBmaster\fR(8) daemon, do a health
check, and other maintenance.

By default, the \fBpostfix\fR(1) command sets up a standardized
environment and runs the \fBpostfix-script\fR shell script
to do the actual work.

However, when support for multiple Postfix instances is
configured, \fBpostfix\fR(1) executes the command specified
with the \fBmulti_instance_wrapper\fR configuration parameter.
This command will execute the \fIcommand\fR for each
applicable Postfix instance.

The following commands are implemented:
.IP \fBcheck\fR
Warn about bad directory/file ownership or permissions,
and create missing directories.
.IP \fBstart\fR
Start the Postfix mail system. This also runs the configuration
check described above.
.IP \fBstop\fR
Stop the Postfix mail system in an orderly fashion. If
possible, running processes are allowed to terminate at
their earliest convenience.
.sp
Note: in order to refresh the Postfix mail system after a
configuration change, do not use the \fBstart\fR and \fBstop\fR
commands in succession. Use the \fBreload\fR command instead.
.IP \fBabort\fR
Stop the Postfix mail system abruptly. Running processes are
signaled to stop immediately.
.IP \fBflush\fR
Force delivery: attempt to deliver every message in the deferred
mail queue. Normally, attempts to deliver delayed mail happen at
regular intervals, the interval doubling after each failed attempt.
.sp
Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
poor delivery performance of all other mail.
.IP \fBreload\fR
Re-read configuration files. Running processes terminate at their
earliest convenience.
.IP \fBstatus\fR
Indicate if the Postfix mail system is currently running.
.IP "\fBset-permissions\fR \fB[\fIname\fR=\fIvalue ...\fB]\fR
Set the ownership and permissions of Postfix related files and
directories, as specified in the \fBpostfix-files\fR file.
.sp
Specify \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR to override and update specific
main.cf configuration parameters. Use this, for example, to
change the \fBmail_owner\fR or \fBsetgid_group\fR setting for an
already installed Postfix system.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  With
Postfix 2.0 and earlier, use "\fB$config_directory/post-install
set-permissions\fR".
.IP "\fBupgrade-configuration\fR \fB[\fIname\fR=\fIvalue ...\fB]\fR
Update the \fBmain.cf\fR and \fBmaster.cf\fR files with information
that Postfix needs in order to run: add or update services, and add
or update configuration parameter settings.
.sp
Specify \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR to override and update specific
main.cf configuration parameters.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  With
Postfix 2.0 and earlier, use "\fB$config_directory/post-install
upgrade-configuration\fR".
.PP
The following options are implemented:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR and \fBmaster.cf\fR configuration files in
the named directory instead of the default configuration directory.
Use this to distinguish between multiple Postfix instances on the
same host.

With Postfix 2.6 and later, this option forces the postfix(1)
command to operate on the specified Postfix instance only.
This behavior is inherited by postfix(1) commands that run
as a descendant of the current process.
.IP "\fB-D\fR (with \fBpostfix start\fR only)"
Run each Postfix daemon under control of a debugger as specified
via the \fBdebugger_command\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostfix\fR(1) command exports the following environment
variables before executing the \fBpostfix-script\fR file:
.IP \fBMAIL_CONFIG\fR
This is set when the -c command-line option is present.

With Postfix 2.6 and later, this environment variable forces
the postfix(1) command to operate on the specified Postfix
instance only.  This behavior is inherited by postfix(1)
commands that run as a descendant of the current process.
.IP \fBMAIL_VERBOSE\fR
This is set when the -v command-line option is present.
.IP \fBMAIL_DEBUG\fR
This is set when the -D command-line option is present.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostlog\fR(1) command implements a Postfix-compatible logging
interface for use in, for example, shell scripts.

By default, \fBpostlog\fR(1) logs the \fItext\fR given on the command
line as one record. If no \fItext\fR is specified on the command
line, \fBpostlog\fR(1) reads from standard input and logs each input
line as one record.

Logging is sent to \fBsyslogd\fR(8); when the standard error stream
is connected to a terminal, logging is sent there as well.

The following options are implemented:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP \fB-i\fR
Include the process ID in the logging tag.
.IP "\fB-p \fIpriority\fR"
Specifies the logging severity: \fBinfo\fR (default), \fBwarn\fR,
\fBerror\fR, \fBfatal\fR, or \fBpanic\fR.
.IP "\fB-t \fItag\fR"
Specifies the logging tag, that is, the identifying name that
appears at the beginning of each logging record. A default tag
is used when none is specified.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.

.SH NAME
postmap
\-
Postfix lookup table management
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
.fi
\fBpostmap\fR [\fB-Nbfhimnoprsvw\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR]
[\fB-d \fIkey\fR] [\fB-q \fIkey\fR]
        [\fIfile_type\fR:]\fIfile_name\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostmap\fR(1) command creates or queries one or more Postfix
lookup tables, or updates an existing one. The input and output
file formats are expected to be compatible with:

.nf
    \fBmakemap \fIfile_type\fR \fIfile_name\fR < \fIfile_name\fR
.fi

If the result files do not exist they will be created with the
same group and other read permissions as their source file.

While the table update is in progress, signal delivery is
postponed, and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on the
entire table, in order to avoid surprises in spectator
processes.
.SH "INPUT FILE FORMAT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The format of a lookup table input file is as follows:
.IP \(bu
A table entry has the form
.sp
.nf
     \fIkey\fR whitespace \fIvalue\fR
.fi
.IP \(bu
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP \(bu
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.PP
The \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR are processed as is, except that
surrounding white space is stripped off. Unlike with Postfix alias
databases, quotes cannot be used to protect lookup keys that contain
special characters such as `#' or whitespace.

By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make
the lookups case insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case
folding happens only with tables whose lookup keys are
fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or hash:. With
earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables
where a lookup field can match both upper and lower case
text, such as regexp: and pcre:. This resulted in loss of
information with $\fInumber\fR substitutions.
.SH "COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP \fB-b\fR
Enable message body query mode. When reading lookup keys
from standard input with "\fB-q -\fR", process the input
as if it is an email message in RFC 2822 format.  Each line
of body content becomes one lookup key.
.sp
By default, the \fB-b\fR option starts generating lookup
keys at the first non-header line, and stops when the end
of the message is reached.
To simulate \fBbody_checks\fR(5) processing, enable MIME
parsing with \fB-m\fR. With this, the \fB-b\fR option
generates no body-style lookup keys for attachment MIME
headers and for attached message/* headers.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and later.
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP "\fB-d \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and remove one entry per map.
The exit status is zero when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream. The exit status is zero
when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-f\fR
Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while creating or querying
a table.

With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no
effect for regular expression tables. There, case folding
is controlled by appending a flag to a pattern.
.IP \fB-h\fR
Enable message header query mode. When reading lookup keys
from standard input with "\fB-q -\fR", process the input
as if it is an email message in RFC 2822 format.  Each
logical header line becomes one lookup key. A multi-line
header becomes one lookup key with one or more embedded
newline characters.
.sp
By default, the \fB-h\fR option generates lookup keys until
the first non-header line is reached.
To simulate \fBheader_checks\fR(5) processing, enable MIME
parsing with \fB-m\fR. With this, the \fB-h\fR option also
generates header-style lookup keys for attachment MIME
headers and for attached message/* headers.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and later.
.IP \fB-i\fR
Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input and do not
truncate an existing database. By default, \fBpostmap\fR(1) creates
a new database from the entries in \fBfile_name\fR.
.IP \fB-m\fR
Enable MIME parsing with "\fB-b\fR" and "\fB-h\fR".
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and later.
.IP \fB-N\fR
Include the terminating null character that terminates lookup keys
and values. By default, \fBpostmap\fR(1) does whatever is
the default for
the host operating system.
.IP \fB-n\fR
Don't include the terminating null character that terminates lookup
keys and values. By default, \fBpostmap\fR(1) does whatever
is the default for
the host operating system.
.IP \fB-o\fR
Do not release root privileges when processing a non-root
input file. By default, \fBpostmap\fR(1) drops root privileges
and runs as the source file owner instead.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Do not inherit the file access permissions from the input file
when creating a new file.  Instead, create a new file with default
access permissions (mode 0644).
.IP "\fB-q \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and write the first value
found to the standard output stream. The exit status is zero
when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream and writes one line of
\fIkey value\fR output for each key that was found. The exit
status is zero when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-r\fR
When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
existing entries, and make those updates anyway.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of
\fIkey value\fR output for each element. The elements are
printed in database order, which is not necessarily the same
as the original input order.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later,
and is not available for all database types.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.IP \fB-w\fR
When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
existing entries, and ignore those attempts.
.PP
Arguments:
.IP \fIfile_type\fR
The database type. To find out what types are supported, use
the "\fBpostconf -m\fR" command.

The \fBpostmap\fR(1) command can query any supported file type,
but it can create only the following file types:
.RS
.IP \fBbtree\fR
The output file is a btree file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBcdb\fR
The output consists of one file, named \fIfile_name\fB.cdb\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBcdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBdbm\fR
The output consists of two files, named \fIfile_name\fB.pag\fR and
\fIfile_name\fB.dir\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdbm\fR databases.
.IP \fBhash\fR
The output file is a hashed file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBfail\fR
A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup table
name is used for logging only. This table exists to simplify
Postfix error tests.
.IP \fBsdbm\fR
The output consists of two files, named \fIfile_name\fB.pag\fR and
\fIfile_name\fB.dir\fR.
This is available on systems with support for \fBsdbm\fR databases.
.PP
When no \fIfile_type\fR is specified, the software uses the database
type specified via the \fBdefault_database_type\fR configuration
parameter.
.RE
.IP \fIfile_name\fR
The name of the lookup table source file when rebuilding a database.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems are logged to the standard error stream and to
\fBsyslogd\fR(8).
No output means that no problems were detected. Duplicate entries are
skipped and are flagged with a warning.

\fBpostmap\fR(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of success
(including successful "\fBpostmap -q\fR" lookup) and terminates
with non-zero exit status in case of failure.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostmulti\fR(1) command allows a Postfix administrator
to manage multiple Postfix instances on a single host.

\fBpostmulti\fR(1) implements two fundamental modes of
operation.  In \fBiterator\fR mode, it executes the same
command for multiple Postfix instances.  In \fBlife-cycle
management\fR mode, it adds or deletes one instance, or
changes the multi-instance status of one instance.

Each mode of operation has its own command syntax. For this
reason, each mode is documented in separate sections below.
.SH "BACKGROUND"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
A multi-instance configuration consists of one primary
Postfix instance, and one or more secondary instances whose
configuration directory pathnames are recorded in the primary
instance's main.cf file. Postfix instances share program
files and documentation, but have their own configuration,
queue and data directories.

Currently, only the default Postfix instance can be used
as primary instance in a multi-instance configuration. The
\fBpostmulti\fR(1) command does not currently support a \fB-c\fR
option to select an alternative primary instance, and exits
with a fatal error if the \fBMAIL_CONFIG\fR environment
variable is set to a non-default configuration directory.

See the MULTI_INSTANCE_README tutorial for a more detailed
discussion of multi-instance management with \fBpostmulti\fR(1).
.SH "ITERATOR MODE"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
In iterator mode, \fBpostmulti\fR performs the same operation
on all Postfix instances in turn.

If multi-instance support is not enabled, the requested
command is performed just for the primary instance.
.PP
Iterator mode implements the following command options:
.SH "Instance selection"
.IP \fB-a\fR
Perform the operation on all instances. This is the default.
.IP "\fB-g \fIgroup\fR"
Perform the operation only for members of the named \fIgroup\fR.
.IP "\fB-i \fIname\fR"
Perform the operation only for the instance with the specified
\fIname\fR.  You can specify either the instance name
or the absolute pathname of the instance's configuration
directory.  Specify "-" to select the primary Postfix instance.
.IP \fB-R\fR
Reverse the iteration order. This may be appropriate when
updating a multi-instance system, where "sink" instances
are started before "source" instances.
.sp
This option cannot be used with \fB-p\fR.
.SH "List mode"
.IP \fB-l\fR
List Postfix instances with their instance name, instance
group name, enable/disable status and configuration directory.
.SH "Postfix-wrapper mode"
.IP \fB-p\fR
Invoke \fBpostfix(1)\fR to execute the specified \fIcommand\fR.
This option implements the \fBpostfix-wrapper\fR(5) interface.
.RS
.IP \(bu
With "start"-like commands, "postfix check" is executed for
instances that are not enabled. The full list of commands
is specified with the postmulti_start_commands parameter.
.IP \(bu
With "stop"-like commands, the iteration order is reversed,
and disabled instances are skipped. The full list of commands
is specified with the postmulti_stop_commands parameter.
.IP \(bu
With "reload" and other commands that require a started
instance, disabled instances are skipped. The full list of
commands is specified with the postmulti_control_commands
parameter.
.IP \(bu
With "status" and other commands that don't require a started
instance, the command is executed for all instances.
.RE
.IP
The \fB-p\fR option can also be used interactively to
start/stop/etc.  a named instance or instance group. For
example, to start just the instances in the group "msa",
invoke \fBpostmulti\fR(1) as follows:
.RS
.IP
# postmulti -g msa -p start
.RE
.SH "Command mode"
.IP \fB-x\fR
Execute the specified \fIcommand\fR for all Postfix instances.
The command runs with appropriate environment settings for
MAIL_CONFIG, command_directory, daemon_directory,
config_directory, queue_directory, data_directory,
multi_instance_name, multi_instance_group and
multi_instance_enable.
.SH "Other options"
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple
\fB-v\fR options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH "LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT MODE"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
With the \fB-e\fR option \fBpostmulti\fR(1) can be used to
add or delete a Postfix instance, and to manage the
multi-instance status of an existing instance.
.PP
The following options are implemented:
.SH "Existing instance selection"
.IP \fB-a\fR
When creating or importing an instance, place the new
instance at the front of the secondary instance list.
.IP "\fB-g \fIgroup\fR"
When creating or importing an instance, place the new
instance before the first secondary instance that is a
member of the specified group.
.IP "\fB-i \fIname\fR"
When creating or importing an instance, place the new
instance before the matching secondary instance.
.sp
With other life-cycle operations, apply the operation to
the named existing instance.  Specify "-" to select the
primary Postfix instance.
.SH "New or existing instance name assignment"
.IP "\fB-I \fIname\fR"
Assign the specified instance \fIname\fR to an existing
instance, newly-created instance, or imported instance.
Instance
names other than "-" (which makes the instance "nameless")
must start with "postfix-".  This restriction reduces the
likelihood of name collisions with system files.
.IP "\fB-G \fIgroup\fR"
Assign the specified \fIgroup\fR name to an existing instance
or to a newly created or imported instance.
.SH "Instance creation/deletion/status change"
.IP "\fB-e \fIaction\fR"
"Edit" managed instances. The following actions are supported:
.RS
.IP \fBinit\fR
This command is required before \fBpostmulti\fR(1) can be
used to manage Postfix instances.  The "postmulti -e init"
command updates the primary instance's main.cf file by
setting:
.RS
.IP
.nf
multi_instance_wrapper =
        ${command_directory}/postmulti -p --
multi_instance_enable = yes
.fi
.RE
.IP
You can set these by other means if you prefer.
.IP \fBcreate\fR
Create a new Postfix instance and add it to the
multi_instance_directories parameter of the primary instance.
The "\fB-I \fIname\fR" option is recommended to give the
instance a short name that is used to construct default
values for the private directories of the new instance. The
"\fB-G \fIgroup\fR" option may be specified to assign the
instance to a group, otherwise, the new instance is not a
member of any groups.
.sp
The new instance main.cf is the stock main.cf with the
parameters that specify the locations of shared files cloned
from the primary instance.  For "nameless" instances, you
should manually adjust "syslog_name" to yield a unique
"logtag" starting with "postfix-" that will uniquely identify
the instance in the mail logs. It is simpler to assign the
instance a short name with the "\fB-I \fIname\fR" option.
.sp
Optional "name=value" arguments specify the instance
config_directory, queue_directory and data_directory.
For example:
.RS
.IP
.nf
# postmulti -I postfix-mumble \e
        -G mygroup -e create \e
        config_directory=/my/config/dir \e
        queue_directory=/my/queue/dir \e
        data_directory=/my/data/dir
.fi
.RE
.IP
If any of these pathnames is not supplied, the program
attempts to generate the pathname by taking the corresponding
primary instance pathname, and by replacing the last pathname
component by the value of the \fB-I\fR option.
.sp
If the instance configuration directory already exists, and
contains both a main.cf and master.cf file, \fBcreate\fR
will "import" the instance as-is. For existing instances,
\fBcreate\fR and \fBimport\fR are identical.
.IP \fBimport\fR
Import an existing instance into the list of instances
managed by the \fBpostmulti\fR(1) multi-instance manager.
This adds the instance to the multi_instance_directories
list of the primary instance.  If the "\fB-I \fIname\fR"
option is provided it specifies the new name for the instance
and is used to define a default location for the instance
configuration directory (as with \fBcreate\fR above).  The
"\fB-G \fIgroup\fR" option may be used to assign the instance
to a group. Add a "\fBconfig_directory=\fI/path\fR" argument
to override a default pathname based on "\fB-I \fIname\fR".
.IP \fBdestroy\fR
Destroy a secondary Postfix instance. To be a candidate for
destruction an instance must be disabled, stopped and its
queue must not contain any messages. Attempts to destroy
the primary Postfix instance trigger a fatal error, without
destroying the instance.
.sp
The instance is removed from the primary instance main.cf
file's alternate_config_directories parameter and its data,
queue and configuration directories are cleaned of files
and directories created by the Postfix system. The main.cf
and master.cf files are removed from the configuration
directory even if they have been modified since initial
creation. Finally, the instance is "deported" from the list
of managed instances.
.sp
If other files are present in instance private directories,
the directories may not be fully removed, a warning is
logged to alert the administrator. It is expected that an
instance built using "fresh" directories via the \fBcreate\fR
action will be fully removed by the \fBdestroy\fR action
(if first disabled). If the instance configuration and queue
directories are populated with additional files (access and
rewriting tables, chroot jail content, etc.) the instance
directories will not be fully removed.
.sp
The \fBdestroy\fR action triggers potentially dangerous
file removal operations. Make sure the instance's data,
queue and configuration directories are set correctly and
do not contain any valuable files.
.IP \fBdeport\fR
Deport a secondary instance from the list of managed
instances. This deletes the instance configuration directory
from the primary instance's multi_instance_directories list,
but does not remove any files or directories.
.IP \fBassign\fR
Assign a new instance name or a new group name to the
selected instance.  Use "\fB-G -\fR" to specify "no group"
and "\fB-I -\fR" to specify "no name".  If you choose to
make an instance "nameless", set a suitable syslog_name in
the corresponding main.cf file.
.IP \fBenable\fR
Mark the selected instance as enabled. This just sets the
multi_instance_enable parameter to "yes" in the instance's
main.cf file.
.IP \fBdisable\fR
Mark the selected instance as disabled. This means that
the instance will not be started etc. with "postfix start",
"postmulti -p start" and so on. The instance can still be
started etc. with "postfix -c config-directory start".

The \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command implements the Postfix user interface
for queue management. It implements operations that are
traditionally available via the \fBsendmail\fR(1) command.
See the \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command for queue operations
that require super-user privileges such as deleting a message
from the queue or changing the status of a message.

The following options are recognized:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory. See also the
MAIL_CONFIG environment setting below.
.IP \fB-f\fR
Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.

This option implements the traditional "\fBsendmail -q\fR" command,
by contacting the Postfix \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon.

Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
poor delivery performance of all other mail.
.IP "\fB-i \fIqueue_id\fR"
Schedule immediate delivery of deferred mail with the
specified queue ID.

This option implements the traditional \fBsendmail -qI\fR
command, by contacting the \fBflush\fR(8) server.

This feature is available with Postfix version 2.4 and later.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.
This option implements the traditional \fBmailq\fR command,
by contacting the Postfix \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon.

Each queue entry shows the queue file ID, message
size, arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
be delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt,
the reason for failure is shown. The queue ID string
is followed by an optional status character:
.RS
.IP \fB*\fR
The message is in the \fBactive\fR queue, i.e. the message is
selected for delivery.
.IP \fB!\fR
The message is in the \fBhold\fR queue, i.e. no further delivery
attempt will be made until the mail is taken off hold.
.RE
.IP "\fB-s \fIsite\fR"
Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the named
\fIsite\fR. A numerical site must be specified as a valid RFC 5321
address literal enclosed in [], just like in email addresses.
The site must be eligible for the "fast flush" service.
See \fBflush\fR(8) for more information about the "fast flush"
service.

This option implements the traditional "\fBsendmail -qR\fIsite\fR"
command, by contacting the Postfix \fBflush\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix 2.3,
this option is available for the super-user only.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.fi
The \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command does maintenance jobs on the Postfix
queue. Use of the command is restricted to the superuser.
See the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command for unprivileged queue operations
such as listing or flushing the mail queue.

By default, \fBpostsuper\fR(1) performs the operations
requested with the
\fB-s\fR and \fB-p\fR command-line options on all Postfix queue
directories - this includes the \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR directories with mail files and the \fBbounce\fR,
\fBdefer\fR, \fBtrace\fR and \fBflush\fR directories with log files.

Options:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory. See also the
MAIL_CONFIG environment setting below.
.IP "\fB-d \fIqueue_id\fR"
Delete one message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR, \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR).

If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
queue IDs from standard input. For example, to delete all mail
with exactly one recipient \fBuser@example.com\fR:
.sp
.nf
mailq | tail +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  \'BEGIN { RS = "" }
    # $7=sender, $8=recipient1, $9=recipient2
    { if ($8 == "user@example.com" && $9 == "")
          print $1 }
\' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -
.fi
.sp
Specify "\fB-d ALL\fR" to remove all messages; for example, specify
"\fB-d ALL deferred\fR" to delete all mail in the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
case.
.sp
Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix
<= 2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).
There is a very small possibility that postsuper deletes the
wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
system is delivering mail.
.sp
The scenario is as follows:
.RS
.IP 1)
The Postfix queue manager deletes the message that \fBpostsuper\fR(1)
is asked to delete, because Postfix is finished with the
message (it is delivered, or it is returned to the sender).
.IP 2)
New mail arrives, and the new message is given the same queue ID
as the message that \fBpostsuper\fR(1) is supposed to delete.
The probability for reusing a deleted queue ID is about 1 in 2**15
(the number of different microsecond values that the system clock
can distinguish within a second).
.IP 3)
\fBpostsuper\fR(1) deletes the new message, instead of the old
message that it should have deleted.
.RE
.IP "\fB-h \fIqueue_id\fR"
Put mail "on hold" so that no attempt is made to deliver it.
Move one message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR) to the \fBhold\fR queue.

If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
queue IDs from standard input.
.sp
Specify "\fB-h ALL\fR" to hold all messages; for example, specify
"\fB-h ALL deferred\fR" to hold all mail in the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
case.
.sp
Note: while mail is "on hold" it will not expire when its
time in the queue exceeds the \fBmaximal_queue_lifetime\fR
or \fBbounce_queue_lifetime\fR setting. It becomes subject to
expiration after it is released from "hold".
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP "\fB-H \fIqueue_id\fR"
Release mail that was put "on hold".
Move one message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR) to the \fBdeferred\fR queue.

If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
queue IDs from standard input.
.sp
Note: specify "\fBpostsuper -r\fR" to release mail that was kept on
hold for a significant fraction of \fB$maximal_queue_lifetime\fR
or \fB$bounce_queue_lifetime\fR, or longer.
.sp
Specify "\fB-H ALL\fR" to release all mail that is "on hold".
As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
case.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Purge old temporary files that are left over after system or
software crashes.
.IP "\fB-r \fIqueue_id\fR"
Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR, \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR).
To requeue multiple messages, specify multiple \fB-r\fR
command-line options.

Alternatively, if a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified,
the program reads queue IDs from standard input.
.sp
Specify "\fB-r ALL\fR" to requeue all messages. As a safety
measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper case.
.sp
A requeued message is moved to the \fBmaildrop\fR queue,
from where it is copied by the \fBpickup\fR(8) and
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemons to a new queue file. In many
respects its handling differs from that of a new local
submission.
.RS
.IP \(bu
The message is not subjected to the smtpd_milters or
non_smtpd_milters settings.  When mail has passed through
an external content filter, this would produce incorrect
results with Milter applications that depend on original
SMTP connection state information.
.IP \(bu
The message is subjected again to mail address rewriting
and substitution.  This is useful when rewriting rules or
virtual mappings have changed.
.sp
The address rewriting context (local or remote) is the same
as when the message was received.
.IP \(bu
The message is subjected to the same content_filter settings
(if any) as used for new local mail submissions.  This is
useful when content_filter settings have changed.
.RE
.IP
Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix
<= 2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).
There is a very small possibility that \fBpostsuper\fR(1) requeues
the wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
system is running, but no harm should be done.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Structure check and structure repair.  This should be done once
before Postfix startup.
.RS
.IP \(bu
Rename files whose name does not match the message file inode
number. This operation is necessary after restoring a mail
queue from a different machine or from backup, when queue
files were created with Postfix <= 2.8 or with
"enable_long_queue_ids = no".
.IP \(bu
Move queue files that are in the wrong place in the file system
hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are no longer needed.
File position rearrangements are necessary after a change in the
\fBhash_queue_names\fR and/or \fBhash_queue_depth\fR
configuration parameters.
.IP \(bu
Rename queue files created with "enable_long_queue_ids =
yes" to short names, for migration to Postfix <= 2.8.  The
procedure is as follows:
.sp
.nf
.na
# postfix stop
# postconf enable_long_queue_ids=no
# postsuper
.ad
.fi
.sp
Run \fBpostsuper\fR(1) repeatedly until it stops reporting
file name changes.
.RE
.IP \fB-S\fR
A redundant version of \fB-s\fR that requires that long
file names also match the message file inode number. This
option exists for testing purposes, and is available with
Postfix 2.9 and later.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to
\fBsyslogd\fR(8).

\fBpostsuper\fR(1) reports the number of messages deleted with \fB-d\fR,
the number of messages requeued with \fB-r\fR, and the number of
messages whose queue file name was fixed with \fB-s\fR. The report

.Em Guidelines for energy reduction
.Pp
CPU time, deadlines and interrupt wakeups: Lower is better
.Pp
Interrupt counts: Lower is better
.Pp
C-state residency: Higher is better
.Pp
.Em Running Tasks
.Pp
1. CPU time consumed by threads assigned to that process, broken down into time spent in user space and kernel mode.
.Pp
2. Counts of "short" timers (where the time-to-deadline was < 5 milliseconds in the future at the point of timer creation) which woke up threads from that process. High frequency timers, which typically have short time-to-deadlines, can result in significant energy consumption.
.Pp
3. A count of total interrupt level wakeups which resulted in dispatching a thread from the process in question. For example, if a thread were blocked in a usleep() system call, a timer interrupt would cause that thread to be dispatched, and would increment this counter. For workloads with a significant idle component, this metric is useful to study in conjunction with the package idle exit metric reported below.
.Pp
4. A count of "package idle exits" induced by timers/device interrupts which awakened threads from the process in question. This is a subset of the interrupt wakeup count. Timers and other interrupts that trigger "package idle exits" have a greater impact on energy consumption relative to other interrupts. With the exception of some Mac Pro systems, Mac and iOS systems are typically single package systems, wherein all CPUs are part of a single processor complex (typically a single IC die) with shared logic that can include (depending on system specifics) shared last level caches, an integrated memory controller etc. When all CPUs in the package are idle, the hardware can power-gate significant portions of the shared logic in addition to each individual processor's logic, as well as take measures such as placing DRAM in to self-refresh (also referred to as auto-refresh), place interconnects into lower-power states etc. Hence a timer or interrupt that triggers an exit from this package idle state results in a a greater increase in power than a timer that occurred when the CPU in question was already executing. The process initiating a package idle wakeup may also be the "prime mover", i.e. it may be the trigger for further activity in its own or other processes. This metric is most useful when the system is relatively idle, as with typical light workloads such as web browsing and movie playback; with heavier workloads, the CPU activity can be high enough such that package idle entry is relatively rare, thus masking package idle exits due to the process/thread in question.
.Pp
5. If any processes arrived and vanished during the inter-sample interval, or a previously sampled process vanished, their statistics are reflected in the row labeled "DEAD_TASKS". This can identify issues involving transient processes which may be spawned too frequently. dtrace ("execsnoop") or other tools can then be used to identify the transient processes in question. Running powermetrics in coalition mode, (see below), will also help track down transient process issues, by billing the coalition to which the process belongs.
.Pp
.Em Interrupt Distribution
.Pp
The interrupts sampler reports interrupt frequencies, classified by interrupt vector and associated device, on a per-CPU basis. Mac OS currently assigns all device interrupts to CPU0, but timers and interprocessor interrupts can occur on other CPUs. Interrupt frequencies can be useful in identifying misconfigured devices or areas of improvement in interrupt load, and can serve as a proxy for identifying device activity across the sample interval. For example, during a network-heavy workload, an increase in interrupts associated with Airport wireless ("ARPT"), or wired ethernet ("ETH0" "ETH1" etc.) is not unexpected. However, if the interrupt frequency for a given device is non-zero when the device is not active (e.g. if "HDAU" interrupts, for High Definition Audio, occur even when no audio is playing), that may be a driver error. The int_sources sampler attributes interrupts to the responsible InterruptEventSources, which helps disambiguate the cause of an interrupt if the vector serves more than one source.
.Pp
.Em Battery Statistics
.Pp
The battery sampler reports battery discharge rates, current and maximum charge levels, cycle counts and degradation from design capacity across the interval in question, if a delta was reported by the battery management unit. Note that the battery controller data may arrive out-of-phase with respect to powermetrics samples, which can cause aliasing issues across short sample intervals. Discharge rates across discontinuities such as sleep/wake may also be inaccurate on some systems; however, the rate of change of the total charge level across longer intervals is a useful indicator of total system load. Powermetrics does not filter discharge rates for A/C connect/disconnect events, system sleep residency etc. Battery discharge rates are typically not comparable across machine models. 
.Pp
.Em Processor Energy Usage
.Pp
The cpu_power sampler reports data derived from the Intel energy models; as of the Sandy Bridge intel microarchitecture, the Intel power control unit internally maintains an energy consumption model whose details are proprietary, but are likely based on duty cycles for individual execution units, current voltage/frequency etc. These numbers are not strictly accurate but are correlated with actual energy consumption. This section lists: power dissipated by the processor package which includes the CPU cores, the integrated GPU and the system agent (integrated memory controller, last level cache), and separately, CPU core power and GT (integrated GPU) power (the latter two in a forthcoming version). The energy model data is generally not comparable across machine models.
.Pp
The cpu_power sampler next reports, on processors with Nehalem and newer microarchitectures, hardware derived processor frequency and idle residency information, labeled "P-states" and "C-states" respectively in Intel terminology.
.Pp
C-states are further classified in to "package c-states" and per-core C-states. The processor enters a "c-state" in the scheduler's idle loop, which results in clock-gating or power-gating CPU core and, potentially, package logic, considerably reducing power dissipation. High package c-state residency is a goal to strive for, as energy consumption of the CPU complex, integrated memory controller if any and DRAM is significantly reduced when in a package c-state. Package c-states occur when all CPU cores within the package are idle, and the on-die integrated GPU if any (SandyBridge mobile and beyond), on the system is also idle. Powermetrics reports package c-state residency as a fraction of the time sampled. This is available on Nehalem microarchitecture and newer processors. Note that some systems, such as Mac Pros, do not enable "package" c-states.
.Pp
Powermetrics also reports per-core c-state residencies, signifying when the core in question (which can include multiple SMTs or "hyperthreads") is idle, as well as active/inactive duty cycle histograms for each logical processor within the core. This is available on Nehalem microarchitecture and newer processors.
.Pp
This section also lists the average clock frequency at which the given logical processor executed when not idle within the sampled interval, expressed as both an absolute frequency in MHz and as a percentage of the nominal rated frequency. These average frequencies can vary due to the operating system's demand based dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Some systems can execute at frequencies greater than the nominal or "P1" frequency, which is termed "turbo mode" on Intel systems. Such operation will manifest as > 100% of nominal frequency. Lengthy execution in turbo mode is typically energy inefficient, as those frequencies have high voltage requirements, resulting in a correspondingly quadratic increase in power insufficient to outweigh the reduction in execution time. Current systems typically have a single voltage/frequency domain per-package, but as the processors can execute out-of-phase, they may display different average execution frequencies.
.Pp
.Em Disk Usage and Network Activity
.Pp
The network and disk samplers reports deltas in disk and network activity that occured during the sample. Also specifying --show-process-netstats and --show-process-io will give you this information on a per process basis in the tasks sampler.
.Pp
.Em Backlight level
.Pp
The battery sampler also reports the instantaneous value of the backlight luminosity level. This value is likely not comparable across systems and machine models, but can be useful when comparing scenarios on a given system.
.Pp
.Em Devices
.Pp
The devices sampler, for each device, reports the time spent in each of the device's states over the course of the sample. The meaning of the different states is specific to each device. Powermetrics denotes low power states with an "L", device usable states with a "U" and power on states with an "O".
.Pp
.Em SMC
.Pp
The smc sampler displays information supplied by the System Management Controller. On supported platforms, this includes fan speed and information from various temperature sensors. These are instantaneous values taken at the end of the sample window, and do not necessarily reflect the values at other times in the window.
.Pp
.Em Thermal
.Pp
The thermal sampler displays the current thermal pressure the system is under. This is an instantaneous value taken at the end of the sample window, and does not necessarily reflect the value at other times in the window.
.Pp
.Em SFI
.Pp
The sfi sampler shows system wide selective forced idle statistics. Selective forced idle is a mechanism the operating system uses to limit system power while minimizing user impact, by throttling certain threads on the system. Each thread belongs to an SFI class, and this sampler displays how much each SFI class is currently being throttled. These are instantaneous values taken at the end of the sample window, and do not necessarily reflect the values at other times in the window. To get SFI wait time statistics on a per process basis use --show-process-wait-times.
.Pp
.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
Changes in system time and sleep/wake can cause minor inaccuracies in reported cpu time.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.
.Sp
By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST, META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-lib\fR=\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --lib=DIR"
Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR 0.958,\s0 you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display the version number and copyrights of this program.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z, --compress=NUMBER"
Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if
\&\fB\-z\fR is not used.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Here are some recipes showing how to utilize \fIpp\fR to bundle
\&\fIsource.pl\fR with all its dependencies, on target machines with
different expected settings:
.IP "Stone-alone setup:" 4
.IX Item "Stone-alone setup:"
To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a
machine that doesn't have perl installed:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.exe\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ packed.exe                        # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:" 4
.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target
machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This produces
a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with \s-1PAR\s0.pm and its dependencies installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:"
Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    % pp \-p source.pl                   # makes source.par
\&    % echo "use PAR \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq;" > packed.pl;
\&    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required
.Ve
.PP
Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.

By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST\s0, \s-1META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-icon\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i, --icon=FILE"
Specify an icon file (in \fI.ico\fR, \fI.exe\fR or \fI.dll\fR format) for the
executable. This option is ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR
is specified.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR=\fIKEY=VAL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N, --info=KEY=VAL"
Add additional information for the packed file, both in \f(CW\*(C`META.yml\*(C'\fR
and in the executable header (if applicable).  The name/value pair is
joined by \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.  You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-N\*(C'\fR multiple times, or use \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR to
link several pairs.
.Sp
For Win32 executables, these special \f(CW\*(C`KEY\*(C'\fR names are recognized:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    Comments        CompanyName     FileDescription FileVersion
\&    InternalName    LegalCopyright  LegalTrademarks OriginalFilename
\&    ProductName     ProductVersion
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-lib\fR=\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --lib=DIR"
Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display the version number and copyrights of this program.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z, --compress=NUMBER"
Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if
\&\fB\-z\fR is not used.

Here are some recipes showing how to utilize \fIpp\fR to bundle
\&\fIsource.pl\fR with all its dependencies, on target machines with
different expected settings:
.IP "Stone-alone setup:" 4
.IX Item "Stone-alone setup:"
To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a
machine that doesn't have perl installed:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.exe\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ packed.exe                        # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:" 4
.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target
machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This produces
a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with \s-1PAR\s0.pm and its dependencies installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:"
Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    % pp \-p source.pl                   # makes source.par
\&    % echo "use PAR \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq;" > packed.pl;
\&    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required
.Ve
.PP
Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.
.Sp
By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST, META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-lib\fR=\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --lib=DIR"
Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR 0.958,\s0 you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display the version number and copyrights of this program.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z, --compress=NUMBER"
Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if
\&\fB\-z\fR is not used.

To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a

.Ve
.IP "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:" 4
.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl

.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target

a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...

Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.

\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required
.Ve
.PP
Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a printing and pagination filter for text files.
When multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted,
and written to standard output.
By default, the input is separated into 66-line pages, each with
.Bl -bullet
.It
A 5-line header with the page number, date, time, and
the pathname of the file.
.It
A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines.
.El
.Pp
If standard output is associated with a terminal,
diagnostic messages are suppressed until the
.Nm
utility has completed processing.
.Pp
When multiple column output is specified,
text columns are of equal width.
By default text columns are separated by at least one
.Em <blank> .
Input lines that do not fit into a text column are truncated.
Lines are not truncated under single column output.
.Sh OPTIONS
In the following option descriptions, column, lines, offset, page, and
width are positive decimal integers and gap is a nonnegative decimal integer.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ar \&+page
Begin output at page number
.Ar page
of the formatted input.
.It Fl Ar column
Produce output that is
.Ar columns
wide (default is 1) that is written vertically
down each column in the order in which the text
is received from the input file.
The options
.Fl e
and
.Fl i
are assumed.
This option should not be used with
.Fl m .
When used with
.Fl t ,
the minimum number of lines is used to display the output.
(To columnify and reshape text files more generally and without additional
formatting, see the
.Xr rs 1
utility.)
.It Fl a
Modify the effect of the
.Fl column
option so that the columns are filled across the page in a round-robin order
(e.g., when column is 2, the first input line heads column
1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second line
in column 1, etc.).
This option requires the use of the
.Fl column
option.
.It Fl d
Produce output that is double spaced.
An extra
.Em <newline>
character is output following every
.Em <newline>
found in the input.
.It Fl e Xo
.Op Ar char Ns
.Op Ar gap
.Xc
Expand each input
.Em <tab>
to the next greater column
position specified by the formula
.Ar n*gap+1 ,
where
.Em n
is an integer > 0.
If
.Ar gap
is zero or is omitted the default is 8.
All
.Em <tab>
characters in the input are expanded into the appropriate
number of
.Em <space>s .
If any nondigit character,
.Ar char ,
is specified, it is used as the input tab character.
.It Fl F
Use a
.Em <form-feed>
character for new pages,
instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of
.Em <newline>
characters.
.It Fl f
Same as
.Fl F
but pause before beginning the first page if standard output is a terminal.
.It Fl h Ar header
Use the string
.Ar header
to replace the
.Ar file name
in the header line.
.It Fl i Xo
.Op Ar char Ns
.Op Ar gap
.Xc
In output, replace multiple
.Em <space>s
with
.Em <tab>s
whenever two or more
adjacent
.Em <space>s
reach column positions
.Ar gap+1 ,
.Ar 2*gap+1 ,
etc.
If
.Ar gap
is zero or omitted, default
.Em <tab>
settings at every eighth column position
is used.
If any nondigit character,
.Ar char ,
is specified, it is used as the output
.Em <tab>
character.
.It Fl L Ar locale
Use
.Ar locale
specified as argument instead of one found in environment.
Use "C" to reset locale to default.
.It Fl l Ar lines
Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to
.Ar lines .
If
.Ar lines
is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer
depths (in lines), the
.Nm
utility suppresses output of both the header and trailer, as if the
.Fl t
option were in effect.
.It Fl m
Merge the contents of multiple files.
One line from each file specified by a file operand is
written side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in
terms of the number of column positions.
The number of text columns depends on the number of
file operands successfully opened.
The maximum number of files merged depends on page width and the
per process open file limit.
The options
.Fl e
and
.Fl i
are assumed.
.It Fl n Xo
.Op Ar char Ns
.Op Ar width
.Xc
Provide
.Ar width
digit line numbering.
The default for
.Ar width ,
if not specified, is 5.
The number occupies the first
.Ar width
column positions of each text column or each line of
.Fl m
output.
If
.Ar char
(any nondigit character) is given, it is appended to the line number to
separate it from whatever follows.
The default for
.Ar char
is a
.Em <tab> .
Line numbers longer than
.Ar width
columns are truncated.
.It Fl o Ar offset
Each line of output is preceded by
.Ar offset
.Em <spaces>s .
If the
.Fl o
option is not specified, the default is zero.
The space taken is in addition to the output line width.
.It Fl p
Pause before each page if the standard output is a terminal.
.Nm
will write an alert character to standard error and wait for a carriage
return to be read on the terminal.
.It Fl r
Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open a file.
.It Fl s Ar char
Separate text columns by the single character
.Ar char
instead of by the appropriate number of
.Em <space>s
(default for
.Ar char
is the
.Em <tab>
character).
.It Fl t
Print neither the five-line identifying
header nor the five-line trailer usually supplied for each page.
Quit printing after the last line of each file without spacing to the
end of the page.
.It Fl w Ar width
Set the width of the line to
.Ar width
column positions for multiple text-column output only.
If the
.Fl w
option is not specified and the
.Fl s
option is not specified, the default width is 72.
If the
.Fl w
option is not specified and the
.Fl s
option is specified, the default width is 512.
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file to be printed.
If no
.Ar file
operands are specified, or if a
.Ar file
operand is
.Sq Fl ,
the standard input is used.
The standard input is used only if no
.Ar file
operands are specified, or if a
.Ar file
operand is
.Sq Fl .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option does not allow the option letter to be separated from its
argument, and the options
.Fl e ,
.Fl i ,
and
.Fl n
require that both arguments, if present, not be separated from the option
letter.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If
.Nm
receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it
flushes all accumulated error messages to the screen before
terminating.
.Pp
Error messages are written to standard error during the printing
process (if output is redirected) or after all successful
file printing is complete (when printing to a terminal).
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
The last space before the tab stop is replaced with a tab character.
In legacy mode, it is not.
.Pp

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B grohtml
front end (which consists of a preprocessor,
.BR pre-grohtml ,
and a device driver,
.BR post-grohtml )
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to html.
Users should always invoke
.B grohtml
via the groff command with a
.B \-Thtml
option.
If no files are given,
.B grohtml
will read the standard input.
A filename of
.B \-
will also cause
.B grohtml
to read the standard input.
Html output is written to the standard output.
When
.B grohtml
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B grohtml
using
.BR groff 's
.B \-P
option.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a aa-text-bits
Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by
.I text
when generating png images.
The default is\~4 but valid values are 0, 1, 2, and\~4.
Note your version of
.B gs
needs to support the
.B \%\-dTextAlphaBits
and
.B \%\-dGraphicAlphaBits
options in order to exploit antialiasing.
A value of\~0 stops
.B grohtml
from issuing antialiasing commands to
.BR gs .
.
.TP
.B \-b
Initialize the background color to white.
.
.TP
.BI \-D dir
Inform
.B grohtml
to place all image files into directory
.IR dir .
.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Prepend directory
.IB dir /dev name
to the search path for font and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR html .
.
.TP
.BI \-g aa-graphic-bits
Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by
.I graphics
when generating png images.
The default is\~4 but valid values are 0, 1, 2, and\~4.
Note your version of
.B gs
needs to support the
.B \%\-dTextAlphaBits
and
.B \%\-dGraphicAlphaBits
options in order to exploit antialiasing.
A value of\~0 stops
.B grohtml
from issuing antialiasing commands to
.BR gs .
.
.TP
.B \-h
Generate section and number headings by using
.BR <B> .\|.\|. </B>
and increasing the font size, rather than using the
.BI <H n >\c
\&.\|.\|.\c
.BI </H n >
tags.
.
.TP
.BI \-i resolution
Select the resolution for all images.
By default this is 100 pixels per inch.
Example:
.B \-i200
indicates 200 pixels per inch.
.
.TP
.BI \-I stem
Determine the image stem name.
If omitted grohtml uses
.BI \%grohtml- XXX
.RI ( XXX
is the process ID).
.
.TP
.BI \-j filename
Inform
.B grohtml
to split the html output into multiple files.
The
.I filename
is the stem and specified section headings
(default is level one) start a new file, named
.IR filename-n.html .
.
.TP
.B \-l
Turn off the production of automatic section links at the top of the
document.
.
.TP
.B \-n
Generate simple heading anchors whenever a section/number heading is found.
Without the option the anchor value is the textual heading.
This can cause problems when a heading contains a `?' on older versions of
some browsers (Netscape).
This flag is automatically turned on if a heading contains an image.
.
.TP
.BI \-o vertical-offset
Specify the vertical offset of images in points.
.
.TP
.B \-p
Display page rendering progress to stderr.
.B grohtml
only displays a page number when an image is required.
.
.TP
.B \-r
Turn off the automatic header and footer line (html rule).
.
.TP
.B \-s size
Set the base point size of the source file.
Thereafter when this point size is used in the source it will correspond
to the html base size.
Every increase of two points in the source will yield a
.B <big>
tag, and conversely when a decrease of two points is seen a
.B <small>
tag is emitted.
.
.TP
.BI \-S level
When splitting html output,
split at the heading level (or higher) defined by
.IR level .
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.
.SH USAGE
There are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to\~4.
.
.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B grohtml
is dependent upon the png utilities
.RB ( \%pnmcut ,
.BR \%pnmcrop ,
.BR \%pnmtopng )
and GhostScript
.RB ( gs ).
.B \%pnmtopng
(version 2.37.6 or greater)
and
.B \%pnmcut
from the netpbm package (version 9.16 or greater) will work also.
It is also dependent upon
.B \%psselect
from the
.B PSUtils
package.
Images are generated whenever a table, picture, equation or line is
encountered.
.
.
.SH BUGS
.B Grohtml
has been completely redesigned and rewritten.
It is still beta code.

.SH NAME
priclass.d \- priority distribution by scheduling class. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B priclass.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz the current
thread's scheduling class and priority. A distribution plot is printed.

With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the thread
has of being scheduled.

This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d, which
produces similar output for priority changes, not samples.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
This samples until Ctrl\-C is hit.

.SH NAME
pridist.d \- process priority distribution. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pridist.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz which process
is on the CPUs, and what the priority is. A distribution plot is printed.

With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the process
(actually, thread) has of being scheduled.

This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d, which
produces similar output for one particular PID.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.Sh NAME
.Nm printf
.Nd formatted output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar format Op Ar arguments ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control
of the
.Ar format .
The
.Ar format
is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters,
which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences which
are converted and copied to the standard output, and format specifications,
each of which causes printing of the next successive
.Ar argument .
.Pp
The
.Ar arguments
after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding format is
either
.Cm c , b
or
.Cm s ;
otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant, with the following extensions:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
.It
If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the
.Tn ASCII
code of the next character.
.El
.Pp
The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the
.Ar arguments .
Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or the null
string.
.Pp
Character escape sequences are in backslash notation as defined in the
.St -ansiC ,
with extensions.
The characters and their meanings
are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm \ea
Write a <bell> character.
.It Cm \eb
Write a <backspace> character.
.It Cm \ec
Ignore remaining characters in this string.
.It Cm \ef
Write a <form-feed> character.
.It Cm \en
Write a <new-line> character.
.It Cm \er
Write a <carriage return> character.
.It Cm \et
Write a <tab> character.
.It Cm \ev
Write a <vertical tab> character.
.It Cm \e\'
Write a <single quote> character.
.It Cm \e\e
Write a backslash character.
.It Cm \e Ns Ar num
.It Cm \e0 Ns Ar num
Write an 8-bit character whose
.Tn ASCII
value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
octal number
.Ar num .
.El
.Pp
Each format specification is introduced by the percent character
(``%'').
The remainder of the format specification includes,
in the following order:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It "Zero or more of the following flags:"
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm #
A `#' character
specifying that the value should be printed in an ``alternate form''.
For
.Cm c , d ,
and
.Cm s ,
formats, this option has no effect.
For the
.Cm o
formats the precision of the number is increased to force the first
character of the output string to a zero.
For the
.Cm x
.Pq Cm X
format, a non-zero result has the string
.Li 0x
.Pq Li 0X
prepended to it.
For
.Cm e , E , f , g ,
and
.Cm G ,
formats, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no
digits follow the point (normally, a decimal point only appears in the
results of those formats if a digit follows the decimal point).
For
.Cm g
and
.Cm G
formats, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they
would otherwise be;
.It Cm \&\-
A minus sign `\-' which specifies
.Em left adjustment
of the output in the indicated field;
.It Cm \&+
A `+' character specifying that there should always be
a sign placed before the number when using signed formats.
.It Sq \&\ \&
A space specifying that a blank should be left before a positive number
for a signed format.
A `+' overrides a space if both are used;
.It Cm \&0
A zero `0' character indicating that zero-padding should be used
rather than blank-padding.
A `\-' overrides a `0' if both are used;
.El
.It "Field Width:"
An optional digit string specifying a
.Em field width ;
if the output string has fewer characters than the field width it will
be blank-padded on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment indicator
has been given) to make up the field width (note that a leading zero
is a flag, but an embedded zero is part of a field width);
.It Precision:
An optional period,
.Sq Cm \&.\& ,
followed by an optional digit string giving a
.Em precision
which specifies the number of digits to appear after the decimal point,
for
.Cm e
and
.Cm f
formats, or the maximum number of characters to be printed
from a string; if the digit string is missing, the precision is treated
as zero;
.It Format:
A character which indicates the type of format to use (one of
.Cm diouxXfFeEgGaAcsb ) .
The uppercase formats differ from their lowercase counterparts only in
that the output of the former is entirely in uppercase.
The floating-point format specifiers
.Pq Cm fFeEgGaA
may be prefixed by an
.Cm L
to request that additional precision be used, if available.
.El
.Pp
A field width or precision may be
.Sq Cm \&*
instead of a digit string.
In this case an
.Ar argument
supplies the field width or precision.
.Pp
The format characters and their meanings are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Cm diouXx
The
.Ar argument
is printed as a signed decimal (d or i), unsigned octal, unsigned decimal,
or unsigned hexadecimal (X or x), respectively.
.It Cm fF
The
.Ar argument
is printed in the style `[\-]ddd.ddd' where the number of d's
after the decimal point is equal to the precision specification for
the argument.
If the precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision
is explicitly 0, no digits and no decimal point are printed.
The values \*[If] and \*[Na] are printed as
.Ql inf
and
.Ql nan ,
respectively.
.It Cm eE
The
.Ar argument
is printed in the style
.Cm e
.Sm off
.Sq Op - Ar d.ddd No \(+- Ar dd
.Sm on
where there
is one digit before the decimal point and the number after is equal to
the precision specification for the argument; when the precision is
missing, 6 digits are produced.
The values \*[If] and \*[Na] are printed as
.Ql inf
and
.Ql nan ,
respectively.
.It Cm gG
The
.Ar argument
is printed in style
.Cm f
.Pq Cm F
or in style
.Cm e
.Pq Cm E
whichever gives full precision in minimum space.
.It Cm aA
The
.Ar argument
is printed in style
.Sm off
.Sq Op - Ar h.hhh No \(+- Li p Ar d
.Sm on
where there is one digit before the hexadecimal point and the number
after is equal to the precision specification for the argument;
when the precision is missing, enough digits are produced to convey
the argument's exact double-precision floating-point representation.
The values \*[If] and \*[Na] are printed as
.Ql inf
and
.Ql nan ,
respectively.
.It Cm c
The first character of
.Ar argument
is printed.
.It Cm s
Characters from the string
.Ar argument
are printed until the end is reached or until the number of characters
indicated by the precision specification is reached; however if the
precision is 0 or missing, all characters in the string are printed.
.It Cm b
As for
.Cm s ,
but interpret character escapes in backslash notation in the string
.Ar argument .
.It Cm \&%
Print a `%'; no argument is used.
.El
.Pp
The decimal point
character is defined in the program's locale (category
.Dv LC_NUMERIC ) .
.Pp
In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of
a field; padding takes place only if the specified field width exceeds
the actual width.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The traditional
.Bx
behavior of converting arguments of numeric formats not beginning
with a digit to the
.Tn ASCII
code of the first character is not supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr echo 1 ,
.Xr printf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is expected to be mostly compatible with the
.St -p1003.2
specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
It is modeled
after the standard library function,
.Xr printf 3 .
.Sh BUGS
Since the floating point numbers are translated from
.Tn ASCII
to floating-point and
then back again, floating-point precision may be lost.
(By default, the number is translated to an IEEE-754 double-precision
value before being printed.
The
.Cm L
modifier may produce additional precision, depending on the hardware platform.)
.Pp
.Tn ANSI
hexadecimal character constants were deliberately not provided.
.Pp
The escape sequence \e000 is the string terminator.
When present in the argument for the
.Cm b
format, the argument will be truncated at the \e000 character.
.Pp
Multibyte characters are not recognized in format strings (this is only
a problem if
.Ql %
can appear inside a multibyte character).
.Pp
Parsing of - arguments is also somewhat different from
.Xr printf 3 ,
where unknown arguments are simply printed instead of being
flagged as errors.

.SH NAME
procsystime \- analyse system call times. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B procsystime
[\-acehoT] [ -p PID | -n name | command ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
procsystime prints details on system call times for processes,
both the elapsed times and on-cpu times can be printed.

The elapsed times are interesting, to help identify syscalls
that take some time to complete (during which the process may
have slept). CPU time helps us identify syscalls that
are consuming CPU cycles to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.\"																				DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A product archive is a flat file with a
.Pa .pkg
extension.
.Nm
creates a deployable product archive, which can be used with the OS X Installer,
or submitted to the Mac App Store. It has 5 different modes, as shown in the 
.Sx SYNOPSIS
above:
.Bl -enum
.\"                                                                             Mode 1
.It
.Em Create a product archive from a bundle (e.g. for the Mac App Store).
If you have a self-contained bundle (e.g. an app) that always gets installed to the
same location (e.g.
.Pa /Applications ) ,
specify the bundle and install path using the
.Cm --component
option. You can specify additional requirements using a
.Sx PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS PROPERTY LIST .
When you specify a bundle,
.Nm
automatically creates a component package, much like
.Xr pkgbuild 1 ,
and synthesizes a distribution file.
.\"                                                                             Mode 2
.It
.Em Create a product archive for in-app content.
Specify in-app content using the
.Cm --content
option.
.\"                                                                             Mode 3
.It
.Em Create a product archive from a destination root.
When you use
.Xr xcodebuild 1
with the
.Em install
action, the result is a destination root, either under
.Pa /tmp ,
or in whatever location you specify with the Xcode
.Ev DSTROOT
setting. Use the
.Nm
.Cm --root
option to specify that destination root directory and its install path.
You can specify additional requirements using a
.Sx PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS PROPERTY LIST .
When you specify a root,
.Nm
automatically creates a component package, much like
.Xr pkgbuild 1 ,
and synthesizes a distribution file.
.\"                                                                             Mode 4
.It
.Em Create a product archive using a distribution file.
If you have a distribution file, use the
.Cm --distribution
option to specify the path to it, and the
.Cm --package-path
option to specify the directory where the component packages are found (if they
are not in the current working directory). All packages referenced by the
distribution will be incorporated into the resulting product archive.
.\"                                                                             Mode 5
.It
.Em Synthesize a distribution for one or more component packages.
This also synthesizes a distribution (also using an optional
.Sx PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS PROPERTY LIST ) ,
but writes out the resulting distribution instead of incorporating it into a product archive.
This can serve as a starting point if a more sophisticated distribution is required.
.El
.Pp
.Em When creating product archives for submission to the Mac App Store,
use only the 
.Cm --component
mode of
.Nm .
The other modes will create product archives that are compatible with the OS X Installer, but
are not necessarily acceptable for the Mac App Store.

.Bl -tag
.\"                                                                             --distribution
.It Cm --distribution Ar dist-path
Use the distribution file at
.Ar dist-path
to define the presentation, choices and packages to be installed by the
product. Each of the package names referenced in the given distribution file
must be found in a path specified with the
.Cm --package-path
flag.
.Pp
If 
.Cm --distribution
is omitted, a distribution will be synthesized to install all of the bundles given by
.Cm --component
flags, or all of the packages given by
.Cm --package
flags.
.\"                                                                             --package-path
.It Cm --package-path Ar search-path
.Nm
will search in 
.Ar search-path
for component packages named in the distribution. You can use multiple
.Cm --package-path
flags if necessary. The current working directory is searched automatically.
.\"                                                                             --resources
.It Cm --resources Ar rsrc-dir
.Nm
will copy the resources from 
.Ar rsrc-dir
into the resulting product archive.
.Ar rsrc-dir
can contain unlocalized resources (such as image files) and/or standard lproj directories (e.g. 
.Pa English.lproj )
containing localized resources (such as strings files).
.\"                                                                             --ui
.It Cm --ui Ar interface-type
If the distribution has multiple choices-outline elements, you can use
.Cm --ui
to select one for building the product archive: this controls which package
references are used. The
.Ar interface-type
should match the value of the
.Dq ui
attribute on the desired choices-outline. The default is to use the choices-outline with no ui attribute.
.Pp
If used without
.Cm --distribution ,
the given
.Ar interface-type
will be used for the choices-outline of the synthesized distribution.
.\"                                                                             --identifier
.It Cm --identifier Ar product-identifier
The given unique (non-localized)

.It Cm --component Ar component-path Op Ar install-path
The bundle at
.Ar component-path
is added to the product archive (as its own component package) and to the synthesized distribution. If
.Ar install-path
is specified, it is used as the default install location for the bundle. (If you omit
.Ar install-path,
a location is inferred from the given
.Ar component-path . )

.It Cm --package Ar pkg-path Op Ar install-path
The component package at
.Ar pkg-path
is added to the product archive and to the synthesized distribution. If
.Ar install-path
is specified, it is used as the default install location for the package, overriding any default
location specified by the component package itself.
.Pp
Valid only if
.Cm --distribution
is not specified.

is used, the path to which the synthesized distribution will be written.
.El
.\"																				PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS PROPERTY LIST 
.Sh PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS PROPERTY LIST
When you use
.Nm
to synthesize a distribution (e.g. with the
.Cm --component
option), you can specify pre-install requirements in a separate property list file, specified with the
.Cm --product
option. (When you use Xcode to create a package for the Mac App Store, you can specify this file using the
.Qq Pre-install Requirements Property List
build setting.)
.Pp
At the top level, this property list is a dictionary, with the following keys:
.Bl -column ".Sy single-graphics-device" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy Key Ta Sy Description
.It Sy os Ta "Minimum allowable OS versions (array of strings)"
.It Sy arch Ta "Supported architectures (array of strings)"
.It Sy ram Ta "Minimum required RAM in gigabytes (real)"
.It Sy bundle Ta "Specific bundles that must exist on the system (array of dictionaries)"
.It Sy all-bundles Ta "Are all of the bundles specified required? (Boolean)" 
.It Sy gl-renderer Ta "Required OpenGL capabilities (string)"
.It Sy cl-device Ta "Required OpenCL capabilities (string)"
.It Sy single-graphics-device Ta "Must OpenGL and OpenCL requirements be met by a single device? (Boolean)"
.It Sy sysctl-requirements Ta "Additional required hardware properties (string)"
.It Sy home Ta "Should installation be allowed in user home directory? (Boolean)"
.El
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Sy os
key defines one or more minimum system versions. You might have multiple versions if a certain
OS update is required for a given major OS version. For example, if you specify 10.5.4 and 10.6.2,
Leopard would be allowed from 10.5.4 up, and Snow Leopard from 10.6.2 up, but 10.6 and 10.6.1 would
be rejected. There is no upper-bound associated with the highest value given.
.Pp
.Em NOTE:
Some of the other requirements imply their own minimum system versions, which may override the values
set here. This is noted below where applicable.
.It
The
.Sy arch
key specifies the supported architectures, e.g. i386 and/or x86_64. Note that i386 allows both
32- and 64-bit systems, but if you specify only x86_64, a 64-bit system is required.
.It
The
.Sy ram
key specifies the minimum amount of RAM required, in gigabytes.
.It
The
.Sy gl-renderer
key specifies a predicate, against which each of the OpenGL hardware renderers will be checked. For the
product to be installed, at least one of the renderers must match the requirements of the predicate.
The given predicate string must be convertible to an NSPredicate, and can use the following key paths:
.Bl -column ".Sy limits.param<value>" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy "Key Path" Ta Sy Description
.It Sy version Ta "The supported OpenGL version as a double (e.g. major.minor)."
.It Sy extensions Ta "An array of OpenGL extension strings supported."
.It Sy limits.<gl-parameter> Ta "The integer value of the named GL parameter (see below)."
.It Sy limits.param<value> Ta "The integer value of the GL parameter named by enum <value> (see below)."
.El
.Pp
Note that arbitrary GL parameters can be checked via the
.Sy limits
key, using the same symbolic name #defined by the GL headers. For example:
.Bd -literal
   ( version >= 2.0
     OR ( ( 'GL_ARB_texture_float' IN extensions OR 'GL_ATI_texture_float' IN extensions )
          AND 'GL_ARB_vertex_blend' IN extensions ) )
   AND ( limits.GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE >= 1024 AND limits.GL_MAX_TEXTURE_STACK_DEPTH > 8 )
.Ed
.Pp
Note that recently-introduced GL parameters may not be recognized by their symbolic names, in which case
you can use the alternate form of
.Sy param<value> ,
where <value> is the enum (integer) value of the parameter. For example:
.Bd -literal
   limits.param0x0D33 >= 1024
.Ed
.Pp
.Em NOTE:
The
.Sy gl-renderer
requirement is ignored on versions of Mac OS X before 10.6.8. For this reason, specifying
.Sy gl-renderer
will cause the minimum system version to be raised to 10.6.8. This may override the values set via the
.Sy os
key.
.It
The
.Sy cl-device
key specifies a predicate, against which each of the OpenCL GPU devices will be checked. For the
product to be installed, at least one of the devices must match the requirements of the predicate.
The given predicate string must be convertible to an NSPredicate, and can use the following key paths:
.Bl -column ".Sy limits.param<value>" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy "Key Path" Ta Sy Description
.It Sy version Ta "The supported OpenCL version as a double (e.g. major.minor)."
.It Sy extensions Ta "An array of OpenCL extension strings supported."
.It Sy limits.<cl-parameter> Ta "The integer value of the named CL deviceInfo parameter."
.It Sy limits.param<value> Ta "The integer value of the CL parameter named by enum <value>."
.El
.Pp
If both 
.Sy cl-device
and
.Sy gl-renderer
are specified, both must be satisfied. By default, the requirements are considered met even if one
graphics device satisfies the OpenGL requirement and a different one satisfies the OpenCL one.
If you want to require that a single device satisfies both, add the
.Sy single-graphics-device
key with a value of true.
.Pp
.Em NOTE:
The
.Sy cl-device
requirement is ignored on versions of Mac OS X before 10.7. For this reason, specifying
.Sy cl-device
will cause the minimum system version to be raised to 10.7. This may override the values set via the
.Sy os
key.
.It
The
.Sy sysctl-requirements
key specifies a predicate, against which additional hardware requirements will be checked. The predicate
uses the
.Xr sysctl 2
facility to obtain hardware properties for the system in use. Note that only a subset of
.Xr sysctl 2
variables are available, including most of the hw.* tree and kern.ostype, kern.osrelease, kern.osrevision,
and kern.version from the kern.* tree. For example:
.Bd -literal
   hw.physicalcpu > 1
.Ed
.Pp
Or:
.Bd -literal
   ( hw.optional.aes == 1 AND hw.memsize >= 4294967296 )
.Ed
.Pp
.Em NOTE:
The
.Sy sysctl-requirements
predicate is ignored on versions of OS X before 10.10. For this reason, specifying
.Sy sysctl-requirements
will cause the minimum system version to be raised to 10.10. This may override the values set via the
.Sy os
key.
.It
The
.Sy bundle
key specifies one or more bundles that must already exist on the system (possibly at some minimum version)
for the product to be installed. For example, this might be appropriate if the product installs
a plugin, and you need to ensure that a compatible version of the host application is available.
Each object in this array is a dictionary with the following keys:
.Bl -column ".Sy CFBundleShortVersionString" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy Key Ta Sy Description
.It Sy id Ta "The CFBundleIdentifier of the bundle (required)"
.It Sy path Ta "The default path of the bundle (required)"
.It Sy CFBundleShortVersionString Ta "The minimum short version string of the bundle (optional)"
.It Sy search Ta "Search for bundle if not found at default path? (Boolean, optional)"
.El
.Pp
The given default
.Sy path
will be checked first. Only if the bundle does not exist at that path, and
.Sy search
is given as true, the bundle identifier
.Sy ( id )
will be used to find the bundle (this is appropriate for applications which the user might move).
If the bundle is found through either method, and its version is greater than or equal to the given
.Sy CFBundleShortVersionString ,
the requirement is met. (If CFBundleShortVersionString is omitted, the bundle need only exist.)
.Pp
If you specify multiple bundles, all must exist, unless you specify the
.Sy all-bundles
key with a value of false, in which case only one of the bundles must exist.
.Pp
If the bundle requirement is not met, the Installer must have a localized explanation to display
to the user. This should be provided in the
.Pa InfoPlist.strings
resource of your top-level bundle (as specified with 
.Cm --component ) ,
under the
.Em RequiredBundlesDescription
key.
.It
The
.Sy home
key, if set to true, designates that the product can be installed under the user's home directory,
as an alternative to installing on the system for all users. This should be enabled only if the
entire product can be installed in the home directory and be functional. (Home directory installation
is disabled by default.) Note that home directory installation is not supported for the Mac App Store.
.El
.\"																				SIGNED PRODUCT ARCHIVES 
.Sh SIGNED PRODUCT ARCHIVES
When creating a product archive, you can optionally add a digital signature to the archive.
You will need to have a certificate and corresponding private key -- together called an
.Dq identity
-- in one of your accessible keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the identity using the
.Cm --sign
option. The identity's name is the same as the
.Dq Common Name
of the certificate.
.Pp
If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify the path to the
keychain file using the 
.Cm --keychain
option. Otherwise, the default keychain search path is used.
.Pp
.Nm
will embed the signing certificate in the product archive, as well as any intermediate
certificates that are found in the keychain. If you need to embed additional certificates
to form a chain of trust between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate
on the system, use the
.Cm --cert
option to give the Common Name of the intermediate certificate. Multiple
.Cm --cert
options may be used to embed multiple intermediate certificates.
.Pp
The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled by default when signing with
a Developer ID identity, but it can be enabled explicitly using the
.Cm --timestamp 
option. A timestamp server must be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't
connected to the Internet, you can use
.Cm --timestamp=none
to disable timestamps, even for a Developer ID identity.
.Pp
Note that component packages do
.Em not
need to be signed (e.g. with

If you want to postpone signing the product archive until it has been tested and is
ready to deploy, you can use
.Xr productsign 1
when you are ready to add the signature.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Cm --sign Ar identity
.Ar input-product-path
.Ar output-product-path
.\"																				DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
adds a digital signature to a product archive previously created with
.Xr productbuild 1 .
Although you can add a digital signature at the time you run
.Xr productbuild 1 ,
you may wish to add a signature later, once the product archive has been
tested and is ready to deploy. If you run
.Nm
on a product archive that was previously signed, the existing signature
will be replaced.
.Pp
To sign a product archive,
you will need to have a certificate and corresponding private key -- together called an
.Dq identity
-- in one of your accessible keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the identity using the
.Cm --sign
option. The identity's name is the same as the
.Dq Common Name
of the certificate.
.Pp
If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify the path to the
keychain file using the 
.Cm --keychain
option. Otherwise, the default keychain search path is used.
.Pp
.Nm
will embed the signing certificate in the product archive, as well as any intermediate
certificates that are found in the keychain. If you need to embed additional certificates
to form a chain of trust between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate
on the system, use the
.Cm --cert
option to give the Common Name of the intermediate certificate. Multiple
.Cm --cert
options may be used to embed multiple intermediate certificates.
.Pp
The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled by default when signing with
a Developer ID identity, but it can be enabled explicitly using the
.Cm --timestamp 
option. A timestamp server must be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't
connected to the Internet, you can use
.Cm --timestamp=none
to disable timestamps, even for a Developer ID identity.
.\"																				OPTIONS 
.Sh ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Cm --sign Ar identity-name
The name of the identity to use for signing the product archive.
.It Cm --keychain Ar keychain-path
Specify a specific keychain to search for the signing identity.
.It Cm --cert Ar certificate-name
Specify an intermediate certificate to be embedded in the product archive.
.It Cm --timestamp
Include a trusted timestamp with the signature.
.It Cm --timestamp=none
Disable trusted timestamp, regardless of identity.
.It Ar input-product-path
The product archive to be signed.
.It Ar output-product-path
The path to which the signed product archive will be written. Must not be the same as

.El                      \" Ends the list
.Pp
.Sh CAVEATS
Certain configuration profiles may be marked as a device profile (system) using the PayloadScope key.  However, the profiles tool will ignore the PayloadScope key and install the profile based on how the profile is installed; either a user profile if installed from a user, or a device profile if installed from root (or sudo).   If you are installing a profile as root, you may use the -U parameter to install or remove the profile for that active user.
.Pp
Specific payload dictionary information is not available since it may contain sensitive information.  Non-sensitive information can be viewed using the System Report.
.Pp
Because this command line tool was not designed to ask for missing information, some profiles may fail to install properly.  The only recourse is to insert the missing information before installing the configuration profile.  The System Preferences application's Profiles pane is designed to handle the querying of missing information.
.Pp
Configuration profiles installed to the wrong user domain (user vs system) may not behave in the way you expect since the information may not be useful to that particular domain.  For example, adding a Mail payload to the system domain will not do anything since Mail payloads must have a user account.   Additionally, since profiles are stored by the user shortname and only stored on the local client, care should be taken to not install a profile that could be used by a same named local user.
.Pp
The profiles tool should only be used from the /usr/bin folder since certain operations are privileged and may fail if moved.
.Pp
The -D command removes all configuration profile information without regards for any services it may have set up.  This may leave your system in a state that requires you to manually clean up any service (account) information the profile(s) had installed - for all users on that system.   You should not use this command without considering its consequences.  There is no way to undo this command.  You will be prompted to confirm this command before it will execute.

If \fI~/.proverc\fR or \fI./.proverc\fR exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in \fI.proverc\fR are specified in the same way as command line options:
.PP

Additional option files may be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rc\*(C'\fR option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-norc\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Under Windows and \s-1VMS\s0 the option file is named \fI_proverc\fR rather than
\&\fI.proverc\fR and is sought only in the current directory.
.ie n .SS "Reading from ""STDIN"""

.IX Subsection "Reading from STDIN"
If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '\-':
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \- < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt
.Ve
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`README\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`examples\*(C'\fR directory of this distribution.
.SS "Default Test Directory"
.IX Subsection "Default Test Directory"
If no files or directories are supplied, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR looks for all files
matching the pattern \f(CW\*(C`t/*.t\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Colored Test Output"
.IX Subsection "Colored Test Output"
Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a
terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by adding the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-color\*(C'\fR switch.
.PP
Color support requires Term::ANSIColor on Unix-like platforms and
Win32::Console windows. If the necessary module is not installed
colored output will not be available.
.SS "Exit Code"
.IX Subsection "Exit Code"
If the tests fail \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will exit with non-zero status.
.SS "Arguments to Tests"
.IX Subsection "Arguments to Tests"
It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \-v t/mytest.t :: \-\-url http://example.com
.Ve
.PP
would run \fIt/mytest.t\fR with the options '\-\-url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.
.ie n .SS """\-\-exec"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-exec\fP"
.IX Subsection "--exec"
Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exec\*(C'\fR
switch:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/ruby \-w\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/perl \-Tw \-mstrict \-Ilib\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/path/to/my/customer/exec\*(Aq
.Ve
.ie n .SS """\-\-merge"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-merge\fP"
.IX Subsection "--merge"
If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-merge\*(C'\fR option to
merge the test scripts' \s-1STDERR\s0 into their \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
This guarantees that \s-1STDOUT \s0(where the test results appear) and \s-1STDERR
\&\s0(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on \s-1STDERR.\s0
.PP
Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on \s-1STDERR\s0 looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.
.ie n .SS """\-\-trap"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-trap\fP"
.IX Subsection "--trap"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-trap\*(C'\fR option will attempt to trap \s-1SIGINT \s0(Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted
.ie n .SS """\-\-state"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-state\fP"
.IX Subsection "--state"
You can ask \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.
.ie n .IP """last""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWlast\fR" 4
.IX Item "last"
Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests in random order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save \-\-shuffle
\&
\&    # Run them again in the same order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=last
.Ve
.ie n .IP """failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfailed\fR" 4
.IX Item "failed"
Run only the tests that failed on the last run.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save
\&
\&    # Run failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed

If you also specify the \f(CW\*(C`save\*(C'\fR option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Repeat until no more failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """passed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWpassed\fR" 4
.IX Item "passed"
Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,all,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """hot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhot\fR" 4
.IX Item "hot"
Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The \f(CW\*(C`hot\*(C'\fR option causes tests to be run in most\-recent\-
failure order.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,save
.Ve
.Sp
Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,all,save
.Ve
.Sp
This combination of options may also be specified thus
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=adrian
.Ve
.ie n .IP """todo""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtodo\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo"
Run any tests with todos.
.ie n .IP """slow""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWslow\fR" 4
.IX Item "slow"
Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the \f(CW\*(C`\-j\*(C'\fR parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=slow \-j9
.Ve
.ie n .IP """fast""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfast\fR" 4
.IX Item "fast"
Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.
.ie n .IP """new""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWnew\fR" 4
.IX Item "new"
Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.
.ie n .IP """old""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWold\fR" 4
.IX Item "old"
Run the tests in oldest to newest order.
.ie n .IP """fresh""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfresh\fR" 4
.IX Item "fresh"
Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.
.ie n .IP """save""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsave\fR" 4
.IX Item "save"
Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called \fI.prove\fR
(\fI_prove\fR on Windows and \s-1VMS\s0) in the current directory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch may be used more than once.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot \-\-state=all,save
.Ve
.ie n .SS "@INC"
.el .SS "\f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "@INC"
prove introduces a separation between \*(L"options passed to the perl which
runs prove\*(R" and \*(L"options passed to the perl which runs tests\*(R"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default \f(CW@INC\fR. Additional library directories can be added
via the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable, via \-Ifoo in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5OPT\*(C'\fR or
via the \f(CW\*(C`\-Ilib\*(C'\fR option to \fIprove\fR.
.SS "Taint Mode"
.IX Subsection "Taint Mode"
Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable do not appear in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is often used during testing to add build
directories to \f(CW@INC\fR prove passes the names of any directories found
in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR as \-I switches. The net effect of this is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.
.SH "FORMATTERS"
.IX Header "FORMATTERS"
You can load a custom TAP::Parser::Formatter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-formatter MyFormatter
.Ve
.SH "SOURCE HANDLERS"
.IX Header "SOURCE HANDLERS"
You can load custom TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers, to change the way the
parser interprets particular \fIsources\fR of \s-1TAP.\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-source MyHandler \-\-source YetAnother t
.Ve
.PP
If you want to provide config to the source you can use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prove \-\-source MyCustom \e
\&        \-\-source Perl \-\-perl\-option \*(Aqfoo=bar baz\*(Aq \-\-perl\-option avg=0.278 \e

\&        \-\-source pgTAP \-\-pgtap\-option pset=format=html \-\-pgtap\-option pset=border=2
.Ve
.PP
Each \f(CW\*(C`\-\-$source\-option\*(C'\fR option must specify a key/value pair separated by an
\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the \f(CW\*(C`extensions=\*(C'\fR examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, as in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pset=\*(C'\fR examples above (escape \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR with a backslash).
.PP
All \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sources\*(C'\fR are combined into a hash, and passed to \*(L"new\*(R" in TAP::Harness's
\&\f(CW\*(C`sources\*(C'\fR parameter.
.PP
See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration is
passed to \fISourceHandlers\fR.
.SH "PLUGINS"
.IX Header "PLUGINS"
Plugins can be loaded using the \f(CW\*(C`\-P\f(CIplugin\f(CW\*(C'\fR syntax, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS ".proverc"
.IX Subsection ".proverc"
If \fI~/.proverc\fR or \fI./.proverc\fR exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in \fI.proverc\fR are specified in the same way as command line options:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # .proverc
\&    \-\-state=hot,fast,save
\&    \-j9
.Ve
.PP
Additional option files may be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rc\*(C'\fR option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-norc\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Under Windows and \s-1VMS\s0 the option file is named \fI_proverc\fR rather than
\&\fI.proverc\fR and is sought only in the current directory.
.ie n .SS "Reading from ""STDIN"""
.el .SS "Reading from \f(CWSTDIN\fP"
.IX Subsection "Reading from STDIN"
If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '\-':
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \- < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt
.Ve
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`README\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`examples\*(C'\fR directory of this distribution.
.SS "Default Test Directory"
.IX Subsection "Default Test Directory"
If no files or directories are supplied, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR looks for all files
matching the pattern \f(CW\*(C`t/*.t\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Colored Test Output"
.IX Subsection "Colored Test Output"
Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a
terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by adding the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-color\*(C'\fR switch.
.PP
Color support requires Term::ANSIColor on Unix-like platforms and
Win32::Console windows. If the necessary module is not installed
colored output will not be available.
.SS "Exit Code"
.IX Subsection "Exit Code"
If the tests fail \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will exit with non-zero status.
.SS "Arguments to Tests"
.IX Subsection "Arguments to Tests"
It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \-v t/mytest.t :: \-\-url http://example.com
.Ve
.PP
would run \fIt/mytest.t\fR with the options '\-\-url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.
.ie n .SS """\-\-exec"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-exec\fP"
.IX Subsection "--exec"
Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exec\*(C'\fR
switch:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/ruby \-w\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/perl \-Tw \-mstrict \-Ilib\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/path/to/my/customer/exec\*(Aq
.Ve
.ie n .SS """\-\-merge"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-merge\fP"
.IX Subsection "--merge"
If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-merge\*(C'\fR option to
merge the test scripts' \s-1STDERR\s0 into their \s-1STDOUT\s0.
.PP
This guarantees that \s-1STDOUT\s0 (where the test results appear) and \s-1STDOUT\s0
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on \s-1STDERR\s0.
.PP
Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on \s-1STDERR\s0 looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.
.ie n .SS """\-\-trap"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-trap\fP"
.IX Subsection "--trap"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-trap\*(C'\fR option will attempt to trap \s-1SIGINT\s0 (Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted
.ie n .SS """\-\-state"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-state\fP"
.IX Subsection "--state"
You can ask \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.
.ie n .IP """last""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWlast\fR" 4
.IX Item "last"
Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests in random order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save \-\-shuffle
\&
\&    # Run them again in the same order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=last
.Ve
.ie n .IP """failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfailed\fR" 4
.IX Item "failed"
Run only the tests that failed on the last run.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save
\&
\&    # Run failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed
.Ve
.Sp
If you also specify the \f(CW\*(C`save\*(C'\fR option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Repeat until no more failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """passed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWpassed\fR" 4
.IX Item "passed"
Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,all,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """hot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhot\fR" 4
.IX Item "hot"
Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The \f(CW\*(C`hot\*(C'\fR option causes tests to be run in most\-recent\-
failure order.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,save
.Ve
.Sp
Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,all,save
.Ve
.Sp
This combination of options may also be specified thus
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=adrian
.Ve
.ie n .IP """todo""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtodo\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo"
Run any tests with todos.
.ie n .IP """slow""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWslow\fR" 4
.IX Item "slow"
Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the \f(CW\*(C`\-j\*(C'\fR parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=slow \-j9
.Ve
.ie n .IP """fast""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfast\fR" 4
.IX Item "fast"
Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.
.ie n .IP """new""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWnew\fR" 4
.IX Item "new"
Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.
.ie n .IP """old""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWold\fR" 4
.IX Item "old"
Run the tests in oldest to newest order.
.ie n .IP """fresh""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfresh\fR" 4
.IX Item "fresh"
Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.
.ie n .IP """save""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsave\fR" 4
.IX Item "save"
Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called \fI.prove\fR
(\fI_prove\fR on Windows and \s-1VMS\s0) in the current directory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch may be used more than once.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot \-\-state=all,save
.Ve
.ie n .SS "@INC"
.el .SS "\f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "@INC"
prove introduces a separation between \*(L"options passed to the perl which
runs prove\*(R" and \*(L"options passed to the perl which runs tests\*(R"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default \f(CW@INC\fR. Additional library directories can be added
via the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable, via \-Ifoo in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5OPT\*(C'\fR or
via the \f(CW\*(C`\-Ilib\*(C'\fR option to \fIprove\fR.
.SS "Taint Mode"
.IX Subsection "Taint Mode"
Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable do not appear in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is often used during testing to add build
directories to \f(CW@INC\fR prove passes the names of any directories found
in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR as \-I switches. The net effect of this is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.
.SH "FORMATTERS"
.IX Header "FORMATTERS"
You can load a custom TAP::Parser::Formatter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-formatter MyFormatter
.Ve
.SH "SOURCE HANDLERS"
.IX Header "SOURCE HANDLERS"
You can load custom TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers, to change the way the
parser interprets particular \fIsources\fR of \s-1TAP\s0.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-source MyHandler \-\-source YetAnother t
.Ve
.PP
If you want to provide config to the source you can use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prove \-\-source MyCustom \e
\&        \-\-source Perl \-\-perl\-option \*(Aqfoo=bar baz\*(Aq \-\-perl\-option avg=0.278 \e
\&        \-\-source File \-\-file\-option extensions=.txt \-\-file\-option extensions=.tmp t
\&        \-\-source pgTAP \-\-pgtap\-option pset=format=html \-\-pgtap\-option pset=border=2
.Ve
.PP
Each \f(CW\*(C`\-\-$source\-option\*(C'\fR option must specify a key/value pair separated by an
\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the \f(CW\*(C`extensions=\*(C'\fR examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, as in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pset=\*(C'\fR examples above (escape \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR with a backslash).
.PP
All \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sources\*(C'\fR are combined into a hash, and passed to \*(L"new\*(R" in TAP::Harness's
\&\f(CW\*(C`sources\*(C'\fR parameter.
.PP
See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration is
passed to \fISourceHandlers\fR.
.SH "PLUGINS"
.IX Header "PLUGINS"
Plugins can be loaded using the \f(CW\*(C`\-P\f(CIplugin\f(CW\*(C'\fR syntax, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-PMyPlugin
.Ve
.PP
This will search for a module named \f(CW\*(C`App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin\*(C'\fR, or failing
that, \f(CW\*(C`MyPlugin\*(C'\fR.  If the plugin can't be found, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will complain & exit.
.PP
You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending \f(CW\*(C`=arg1,arg2,etc\*(C'\fR to the
plugin name:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa

.IX Subsection ".proverc"
If \fI~/.proverc\fR or \fI./.proverc\fR exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in \fI.proverc\fR are specified in the same way as command line options:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # .proverc
\&    \-\-state=hot,fast,save
\&    \-j9
.Ve
.PP
Additional option files may be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rc\*(C'\fR option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-norc\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Under Windows and \s-1VMS\s0 the option file is named \fI_proverc\fR rather than
\&\fI.proverc\fR and is sought only in the current directory.
.ie n .SS "Reading from ""STDIN"""
.el .SS "Reading from \f(CWSTDIN\fP"
.IX Subsection "Reading from STDIN"
If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '\-':
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \- < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt
.Ve
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`README\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`examples\*(C'\fR directory of this distribution.
.SS "Default Test Directory"
.IX Subsection "Default Test Directory"
If no files or directories are supplied, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR looks for all files
matching the pattern \f(CW\*(C`t/*.t\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Colored Test Output"
.IX Subsection "Colored Test Output"
Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a
terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by adding the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-color\*(C'\fR switch.
.PP
Color support requires Term::ANSIColor on Unix-like platforms and
Win32::Console windows. If the necessary module is not installed
colored output will not be available.
.SS "Exit Code"
.IX Subsection "Exit Code"
If the tests fail \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will exit with non-zero status.
.SS "Arguments to Tests"
.IX Subsection "Arguments to Tests"
It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \-v t/mytest.t :: \-\-url http://example.com
.Ve
.PP
would run \fIt/mytest.t\fR with the options '\-\-url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.
.ie n .SS """\-\-exec"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-exec\fP"
.IX Subsection "--exec"
Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exec\*(C'\fR
switch:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/ruby \-w\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/perl \-Tw \-mstrict \-Ilib\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/path/to/my/customer/exec\*(Aq
.Ve
.ie n .SS """\-\-merge"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-merge\fP"
.IX Subsection "--merge"
If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-merge\*(C'\fR option to
merge the test scripts' \s-1STDERR\s0 into their \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
This guarantees that \s-1STDOUT \s0(where the test results appear) and \s-1STDERR
\&\s0(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on \s-1STDERR.\s0
.PP
Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on \s-1STDERR\s0 looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.
.ie n .SS """\-\-trap"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-trap\fP"
.IX Subsection "--trap"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-trap\*(C'\fR option will attempt to trap \s-1SIGINT \s0(Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted
.ie n .SS """\-\-state"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-state\fP"
.IX Subsection "--state"
You can ask \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.
.ie n .IP """last""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWlast\fR" 4
.IX Item "last"
Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests in random order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save \-\-shuffle
\&
\&    # Run them again in the same order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=last
.Ve
.ie n .IP """failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfailed\fR" 4
.IX Item "failed"
Run only the tests that failed on the last run.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save
\&
\&    # Run failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed
.Ve
.Sp
If you also specify the \f(CW\*(C`save\*(C'\fR option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Repeat until no more failures
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """passed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWpassed\fR" 4
.IX Item "passed"
Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,all,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """hot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhot\fR" 4
.IX Item "hot"
Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The \f(CW\*(C`hot\*(C'\fR option causes tests to be run in most\-recent\-
failure order.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,save
.Ve
.Sp
Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,all,save
.Ve
.Sp
This combination of options may also be specified thus
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=adrian
.Ve
.ie n .IP """todo""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtodo\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo"
Run any tests with todos.
.ie n .IP """slow""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWslow\fR" 4
.IX Item "slow"
Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the \f(CW\*(C`\-j\*(C'\fR parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=slow \-j9
.Ve
.ie n .IP """fast""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfast\fR" 4
.IX Item "fast"
Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.
.ie n .IP """new""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWnew\fR" 4
.IX Item "new"
Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.
.ie n .IP """old""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWold\fR" 4
.IX Item "old"
Run the tests in oldest to newest order.
.ie n .IP """fresh""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfresh\fR" 4
.IX Item "fresh"
Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.
.ie n .IP """save""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsave\fR" 4
.IX Item "save"
Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called \fI.prove\fR
(\fI_prove\fR on Windows and \s-1VMS\s0) in the current directory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch may be used more than once.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot \-\-state=all,save
.Ve
.ie n .SS "@INC"
.el .SS "\f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "@INC"
prove introduces a separation between \*(L"options passed to the perl which
runs prove\*(R" and \*(L"options passed to the perl which runs tests\*(R"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default \f(CW@INC\fR. Additional library directories can be added
via the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable, via \-Ifoo in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5OPT\*(C'\fR or
via the \f(CW\*(C`\-Ilib\*(C'\fR option to \fIprove\fR.
.SS "Taint Mode"
.IX Subsection "Taint Mode"
Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable do not appear in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is often used during testing to add build
directories to \f(CW@INC\fR prove passes the names of any directories found
in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR as \-I switches. The net effect of this is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.
.SH "FORMATTERS"
.IX Header "FORMATTERS"
You can load a custom TAP::Parser::Formatter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-formatter MyFormatter
.Ve
.SH "SOURCE HANDLERS"
.IX Header "SOURCE HANDLERS"
You can load custom TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers, to change the way the
parser interprets particular \fIsources\fR of \s-1TAP.\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-\-source MyHandler \-\-source YetAnother t
.Ve
.PP
If you want to provide config to the source you can use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prove \-\-source MyCustom \e
\&        \-\-source Perl \-\-perl\-option \*(Aqfoo=bar baz\*(Aq \-\-perl\-option avg=0.278 \e
\&        \-\-source File \-\-file\-option extensions=.txt \-\-file\-option extensions=.tmp t
\&        \-\-source pgTAP \-\-pgtap\-option pset=format=html \-\-pgtap\-option pset=border=2
.Ve
.PP
Each \f(CW\*(C`\-\-$source\-option\*(C'\fR option must specify a key/value pair separated by an
\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the \f(CW\*(C`extensions=\*(C'\fR examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, as in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pset=\*(C'\fR examples above (escape \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR with a backslash).
.PP
All \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sources\*(C'\fR are combined into a hash, and passed to \*(L"new\*(R" in TAP::Harness's
\&\f(CW\*(C`sources\*(C'\fR parameter.
.PP
See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration is
passed to \fISourceHandlers\fR.
.SH "PLUGINS"
.IX Header "PLUGINS"
Plugins can be loaded using the \f(CW\*(C`\-P\f(CIplugin\f(CW\*(C'\fR syntax, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
This will search for a module named \f(CW\*(C`App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin\*(C'\fR, or failing
that, \f(CW\*(C`MyPlugin\*(C'\fR.  If the plugin can't be found, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will complain & exit.
.PP
You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending \f(CW\*(C`=arg1,arg2,etc\*(C'\fR to the

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
displays a header line, followed by lines containing information about
all of your
processes that have controlling terminals.
.Pp
A different set of processes can be selected for display by using any
combination of the
.Fl a , G , g , p , T , t , U ,
and
.Fl u
options.
If more than one of these options are given, then
.Nm
will select all processes which are matched by at least one of the
given options.
.Pp
For the processes which have been selected for display,
.Nm
will usually display one line per process.
The
.Fl M
option may result in multiple output lines (one line per thread) for
some processes.
By default all of these output lines are sorted first by controlling
terminal, then by process ID.
The
.Fl m , r ,
and
.Fl v
options will change the sort order.
If more than one sorting option was given, then the selected processes
will be sorted by the last sorting option which was specified.
.Pp
For the processes which have been selected for display, the information
to display is selected based on a set of keywords (see the
.Fl L , O ,
and
.Fl o
options).
The default output format includes, for each process, the process' ID,
controlling terminal, CPU time (including both user and system time),
state, and associated command.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Display information about other users' processes,
including those without controlling terminals.
.It Fl a
Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.
This will skip any processes which do not have a controlling terminal,
unless the
.Fl x
option is also specified.
.It Fl C
Change the way the CPU percentage is calculated by using a
.Dq raw
CPU calculation that ignores
.Dq resident
time (this normally has
no effect).
.It Fl c
Change the
.Dq command
column output to just contain the executable name,
rather than the full command line.
.It Fl d
Like
.Fl A ,
but excludes session leaders.
.It Fl E
Display the environment as well.
This does not reflect changes in the environment after process launch.
.It Fl e
Identical to
.Fl A .
.It Fl f
Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, 
controlling tty, elapsed CPU usage, and the associated command.
If the
.Fl u
option is also used, display the user name rather then the numeric uid.
When
.Fl o
or
.Fl O
is used to add to the display following
.Fl f ,
the command field is not truncated as severely as it is in other formats.
.It Fl G
Display information about processes
which are running with the specified real group IDs.
.It Fl g
Display information about processes with the specified
process group leaders.
.It Fl h
Repeat the information header as often as necessary
to guarantee one header per page of information.
.It Fl j
Print information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm user , pid , ppid , pgid , sess , jobc , state , tt , time ,
and
.Cm command .
.It Fl L
List the set of keywords available for the
.Fl O
and
.Fl o
options.
.It Fl l
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm uid , pid , ppid , flags , cpu , pri , nice , vsz=SZ , rss ,
.Cm wchan , state=S , paddr=ADDR , tty , time ,
and
.Cm command=CMD .
.It Fl M
Print the threads corresponding to each task.
.It Fl m
Sort by memory usage, instead of the combination of controlling
terminal and process ID.
.It Fl O
Add the information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specified, after the process ID,
in the default information
display.
Keywords may be appended with an equals
.Pq Ql =
sign and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.It Fl o
Display information associated with the space or comma separated
list of keywords specified.
Multiple keywords may also be given in the form of more than one
.Fl o
option.
Keywords may be appended with an equals
.Pq Ql =
sign and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
If all keywords have empty header texts, no header line is written.
.It Fl p
Display information about processes which match the specified process IDs.
.It Fl r
Sort by current CPU usage, instead of the combination of controlling
terminal and process ID.
.It Fl S
Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited
children to their parent process.
.It Fl T
Display information about processes attached to the device associated
with the standard input.
.It Fl t
Display information about processes attached to the specified terminal
devices.
.It Fl U
Display the processes belonging to the specified real user IDs.
.It Fl u
Display the processes belonging to the specified usernames.
.It Fl v
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm pid , state , time , sl , re , pagein , vsz , rss , lim , tsiz ,
.Cm %cpu , %mem ,
and
.Cm command .
The
.Fl v
option implies the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl w
Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default which
is your window size.
If the
.Fl w
option is specified more than once,
.Nm
will use as many columns as necessary without regard for your window size.
When output is not to a terminal, an unlimited number of columns are
always used.
.It Fl X
When displaying processes matched by other options, skip any processes
which do not have a controlling terminal.
.It Fl x
When displaying processes matched by other options, include processes
which do not have a controlling terminal.
This is the opposite of the
.Fl X
option.
If both
.Fl X
and
.Fl x
are specified in the same command, then
.Nm
will use the one which was specified last.
.El
.Pp
A complete list of the available keywords is given below.
Some of these keywords are further specified as follows:
.Bl -tag -width lockname
.It Cm %cpu
The CPU utilization of the process;
this is a decaying average over up to a minute of previous (real) time.
Because the time base over which this is computed varies
(some processes may be very young),
it is possible for the sum of all
.Cm %cpu
fields to exceed 100%.
.It Cm %mem
The percentage of real memory used by this process.
.It Cm flags
The flags associated with the process as in
the include file
.In sys/proc.h :
.Bl -column P_STOPPED_SINGLE 0x4000000
.It Dv "P_ADVLOCK" Ta No "0x00001	Process may hold a POSIX advisory lock"

.It Dv "P_KDEBUG" Ta No "0x80000        Kdebug tracing on for this process"
.El
.It Cm lim
The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
.It Cm lstart
The exact time the command started, using the
.Ql %c
format described in
.Xr strftime 3 .
.It Cm nice
The process scheduling increment (see
.Xr setpriority 2 ) .
.It Cm rss
the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte units).
.It Cm start
The time the command started.
If the command started less than 24 hours ago, the start time is
displayed using the
.Dq Li %l:ps.1p
format described in
.Xr strftime 3 .
If the command started less than 7 days ago, the start time is
displayed using the
.Dq Li %a6.15p
format.
Otherwise, the start time is displayed using the
.Dq Li %e%b%y
format.
.It Cm state
The state is given by a sequence of characters, for example,
.Dq Li RWNA .
The first character indicates the run state of the process:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li I
Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).
.It Li R
Marks a runnable process.
.It Li S
Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.
.It Li T
Marks a stopped process.
.It Li U
Marks a process in uninterruptible wait.
.It Li Z
Marks a dead process (a
.Dq zombie ) .
.El
.Pp
Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional state
information:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li +
The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.
.It Li <
The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
.It Li >
The process has specified a soft limit on memory requirements and is
currently exceeding that limit; such a process is (necessarily) not
swapped.
.It Li A
the process has asked for random page replacement
.Pf ( Dv VA_ANOM ,
from
.Xr vadvise 2 ,
for example,
.Xr lisp 1
in a garbage collect).
.It Li E
The process is trying to exit.
.It Li L
The process has pages locked in core (for example, for raw
.Tn I/O ) .
.It Li N
The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
.Xr setpriority 2 ) .
.It Li S
The process has asked for
.Tn FIFO
page replacement
.Pf ( Dv VA_SEQL ,
from
.Xr vadvise 2 ,
for example, a large image processing program using virtual memory to
sequentially address voluminous data).
.It Li s
The process is a session leader.
.It Li V
The process is suspended during a
.Xr vfork 2 .
.It Li W
The process is swapped out.
.It Li X
The process is being traced or debugged.
.El
.It Cm tt
An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if any.
The abbreviation consists of the three letters following
.Pa /dev/tty ,
or, for the console,
.Dq Li con .
This is followed by a
.Ql -
if the process can no longer reach that
controlling terminal (i.e., it has been revoked).
.It Cm wchan
The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example, 0x80324000 prints
as 324000.
.El
.Pp
When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a zombie)
is listed as
.Dq Li <defunct> ,
and a process which is blocked while trying
to exit is listed as
.Dq Li <exiting> .
If the arguments cannot be located (usually because it has not been set, as is
the case of system processes and/or kernel threads) the command name is printed
within square brackets.
The process can change the arguments shown with
.Xr setproctitle 3 .
Otherwise,
.Nm
makes an educated guess as to the file name and arguments given when the
process was created by examining memory or the swap area.
The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in any event a process
is entitled to destroy this information.
The ucomm (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
If the arguments are unavailable or do not agree with the ucomm keyword,
the value for the ucomm keyword is appended to the arguments in parentheses.

.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
In legacy mode,
.Nm
functions as described above, with the following differences:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Display the environment as well. Same as
.Fl E .
.It Fl g
Ignored for compatibility. Takes no argument.
.It Fl l
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm uid , pid , ppid , cpu , pri , nice , vsz , rss , wchan , state ,
.Cm tt, time ,
and
.Cm command .
.It Fl u
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm user , pid , %cpu , %mem , vsz , rss , tt , state , start , time ,
and
.Cm command .
The
.Fl u
option implies the
.Fl r
option.
.El
.Pp
The biggest change is in the interpretation of the
.Fl u
option,
which now displays processes belonging to the specified username(s).
Thus, "ps -aux" will fail (unless you want to know about user "x").
As a convenience, however, "ps aux" still works as it did in Tiger.
.Pp

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility supports the
.St -susv3
standard.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v4 .
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Nm
cannot run faster than the system and is run as any other scheduled
process, the information it displays can never be exact.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not correctly display argument lists containing multibyte
characters.
