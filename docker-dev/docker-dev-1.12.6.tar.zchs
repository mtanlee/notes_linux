	The arrays represent the order in which the proxies should be tried - try to download the URL
	using the first entry in the array, and if that fails, try using the second entry, and so on.

	The keys to the proxy dictionaries follow the function declarations; every proxy dictionary 
	will have an entry for kCFProxyTypeKey.  If the type is anything except 
	kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL, the dictionary will also have entries for the proxy's host
	and port (under kCFProxyHostNameKey and kCFProxyPortNumberKey respectively).  If the type is
	kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL, it will have an entry for kCFProxyAutoConfigurationURLKey.  
	
	The keys for username and password are optional and will only be present if the username 
	or password could be extracted from the information passed in (i.e. either the URL itself
	or the proxy dictionary supplied).  These APIs do not consult any external credential stores

//  CalRecurrenceEnd is an attribute of CalRecurrenceRule that defines how long the recurrence is scheduled to repeat.

    This file has been updated to include Sound Manager 3.3 interfaces.

    Some of the Sound Manager 3.0 interfaces were not put into the InterfaceLib
    that originally shipped with the PowerMacs. These missing functions and the
    new 3.3 interfaces have been released in the SoundLib library for PowerPC
    developers to link with. The runtime library for these functions are
    installed by the Sound Manager. The following functions are found in SoundLib.

        GetCompressionInfo(), GetSoundPreference(), SetSoundPreference(),
        UnsignedFixedMulDiv(), SndGetInfo(), SndSetInfo(), GetSoundOutputInfo(),
        SetSoundOutputInfo(), GetCompressionName(), SoundConverterOpen(),
        SoundConverterClose(), SoundConverterGetBufferSizes(), SoundConverterBeginConversion(),
        SoundConverterConvertBuffer(), SoundConverterEndConversion(),
        AudioGetBass(), AudioGetInfo(), AudioGetMute(), AudioGetOutputDevice(),
        AudioGetTreble(), AudioGetVolume(), AudioMuteOnEvent(), AudioSetBass(),
        AudioSetMute(), AudioSetToDefaults(), AudioSetTreble(), AudioSetVolume(),
        OpenMixerSoundComponent(), CloseMixerSoundComponent(), SoundComponentAddSource(),
        SoundComponentGetInfo(), SoundComponentGetSource(), SoundComponentGetSourceData(),
        SoundComponentInitOutputDevice(), SoundComponentPauseSource(),
        SoundComponentPlaySourceBuffer(), SoundComponentRemoveSource(),
        SoundComponentSetInfo(), SoundComponentSetOutput(), SoundComponentSetSource(),
        SoundComponentStartSource(), SoundComponentStopSource(),
        ParseAIFFHeader(), ParseSndHeader(), SoundConverterGetInfo(), SoundConverterSetInfo()

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Dispatches a Carbon event of type kEventAppleEvent to the
 *    appropriate AppleEvent handlers.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This API is similar to AEProcessAppleEvent, but does not require
 *    the Carbon event to be converted to an EventRecord. Also, unlike
 *    AEProcessAppleEvent, this API does not require that an event be
 *    removed from its event queue before processing; the AppleEvent
 *    will be correctly dispatched even if the Carbon event is still in
 *    its event queue. Of course, you should still remove the Carbon
 *    event from its event queue later once you're done handling it,
 *    and it is also acceptable to remove it from the event queue
 *    before calling this API.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inEvent:
 *      A Carbon event of class kEventClassAppleEvent and kind
 *      kEventAppleEvent.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    The operating system result code returned by the AppleEvent
 *    handler, or paramErr if the event passed to this API is not of
 *    the correct class and kind.

/*****************************************************************************
    NOTES ON THEME BRUSHES
    Theme brushes can be either colors or patterns, depending on the theme.
    Because of this, you should be prepared to handle the case where a brush
    is a pattern and save and restore the pnPixPat and bkPixPat fields of
    your GrafPorts when saving the fore and back colors. Also, since patterns
    in bkPixPat override the background color of the window, you should use
    BackPat to set your background pattern to a normal white pattern. This
    will ensure that you can use RGBBackColor to set your back color to white,
    call EraseRect and get the expected results.

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Draws text into the area you specify.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    DrawThemeTextBox allows you to draw theme-savvy (ie. Aqua-savvy
 *    on Mac OS X) text. It is unicode savvy (although only partially
 *    so under CarbonLib), and allows you to customize certain text
 *    rendering characteristics such as the font, wrapping behavior,
 *    and justification. The text is drawn into the CGContextRef you
 *    provide, or into the current Quickdraw port if no CGContextRef is
 *    provided. None of DrawThemeTextBox's parameters imply a color, so
 *    you must set up the desired text color separately before calling
 *    DrawThemeTextBox. If you provide a CGContextRef, its fill color
 *    will be used to draw the text. If you do not provide a
 *    CGContextRef, a color based on the current Quickdraw port's
 *    foreground color and the grayishTextOr mode (if set) will be used
 *    to draw the text.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inString:
 *      A CFStringRef containing the unicode characters you wish to
 *      render. You MUST NOT pass in a CFStringRef that was allocated
 *      with any of the "NoCopy" CFString creation APIs; a string
 *      created with a "NoCopy" API has transient storage which is
 *      incompatible with DrawThemeTextBox's caches.
 *    
 *    inFontID:
 *      The ThemeFontID describing the font you'd like to render the
 *      text with. See the discussion of ThemeFontIDs elsewhere in this
 *      header.
 *    
 *    inState:
 *      The ThemeDrawState describing the the state of the interface
 *      element you are drawing the text for. If, for example, you are
 *      drawing text for an inactive window, you would pass
 *      kThemeStateInactive. The ThemeDrawState is generally only used
 *      to determine the shadow characteristics for the text on Mac OS
 *      X. Note that the ThemeDrawState does NOT imply a color. It is
 *      NOT used as a mechanism for graying the text. If you wish to
 *      draw grayed text, you must set up the desired gray color and
 *      apply it to either the current Quickdraw port or the
 *      CGContextRef as appropriate.
 *    
 *    inWrapToWidth:
 *      A Boolean indicating whether you want to draw multiple lines of
 *      text wrapped to a bounding box. False indicates that only one
 *      line of text should be drawn without any sort of wrapping.
 *    
 *    inBoundingBox:
 *      The rectangle (in coordinates relative to the current Quickdraw
 *      port) describing the area to draw the text within. The first
 *      line of text will be top-justified to this rectangle. Wrapping
 *      (if desired) will happen at the horizontal extent of this
 *      rectangle. Regardless of the amount of text in your
 *      CFStringRef, all drawn text will be clipped to this rectangle.
 *    
 *    inJust:
 *      The horizontal justification you would like for your text. You
 *      can use one of the standard justification constants from
 *      TextEdit.h.
 *    
 *    inContext:
 *      The CGContextRef into which you would like to draw the text. On
 *      Mac OS X, all text drawing happens in CGContextRefs; if you
 *      pass NULL, a transient CGContextRef will be allocated and
 *      deallocated for use within the single API call. Relying on the
 *      system behavior if transiently creating CGContextRefs may
 *      result in performance problems. On Mac OS 9, the CGContextRef
 *      parameter is ignored.

 *      is drawn relative to the content rectangle of the window, so
 *      this parameter does not describe the actual widget bounds, it
 *      describes the window's content rectangle.

 *    metrics:
 *      A pointer to a set of valid ThemeWindowMetrics.  At this time,

   *** NOTE ON AUTOMATIC TYPE CONVERSIONS
   Please keep in mind that some of these types can be automatically converted
   to other types just by asking for them as different types. The following
   type conversions are automatic:
    Mac OS X 10.1 and later:
        typeQDPoint                             <-->    typeHIPoint
    Mac OS X 10.2 and later:
        typeQDRectangle                         <-->    typeHIRect
        typeCFTypeRef(CFNumber)                  -->    typeSInt16, typeSInt32, typeUInt32, typeSInt64
        typeCFTypeRef(CFNumber)                  -->    typeIEEE32BitFloatingPoint, typeIEEE64BitFloatingPoint
        typeCFTypeRef(CFBoolean)                 -->    typeBoolean
        typeCFTypeRef(CFNumber)                  -->    typeBoolean
        typeCFTypeRef(AXUIElementRef)            -->    typeHIAccessibleObjectRef
        any CF type other than typeCFTypeRef     -->    typeCFTypeRef
    Mac OS X 10.4 and later:
        type[Mutable]CFStringRef                 -->    typeUnicodeText
    Mac OS X 10.5 and later:
        typeVoidPtr                             <-->    typeSInt32 (32-bit only)
                                                <-->    typeUInt32 (32-bit only)
        typeByteCount                           <-->    typeSInt32 (32-bit only)
        typeByteOffset                          <-->    typeSInt32 (32-bit only)
        typeGDHandle                            <-->    typeCGDisplayID (32-bit only)
        typeCGFloat                             <-->    typeFloat/typeIEEE64BitFloatingPoint (32-bit only)
        The following event parameter types allow clients to explicitly state the coordinate space of
        the point, size, rectangle or scalar. Automatic translations are provided between all of the
        various coordinate spaces. The 72DPIGlobal coordinate space is assumed for the pre-existing
        point, size, rectangle and scalar types. For more information on coordinate spaces see HIGeometry.h.
        typeHIPoint                             <-->    typeHIPoint72DPIGlobal, typeHIPointScreenPixel
        typeHISize                              <-->    typeHISize72DPIGlobal, typeHISizeScreenPixel
        typeHIRect                              <-->    typeHIRect72DPIGlobal, typeHIRectScreenPixel
        typeCGFloat                             <-->    typeCGFloat72DPIGlobal, typeCGFloatScreenPixel
    Also, any registered AppleEvent coercion handlers will be called to coerce data types
    that are otherwise not convertable.

    Event parameter changes for 64-bit applications
    
    With the introduction of 64-bit support in the Carbon Event Manager, four kinds of event parameters
    require changes to their underlying data types. The parameters that have changed are used to pass
    refcon data, byte counts, byte offsets, and graphics devices.
    
    In the case of refcon data, byte counts, and byte offsets, these parameters used typeSInt32 or
    typeUInt32 as the event parameter type prior to Mac OS X 10.5. Unfortunately, typeSInt32 and typeUInt32
    specify a 32-bit value, and on Mac OS X 10.5, these parameters must be 64 bits wide when
    compiling for the 64-bit API so that 64-bit pointers, byte counts, and byte offsets may be passed
    without truncation.
    
    We have defined three new event parameter types to provide source compatibility between 32-bit and
    64-bit applications: typeRefCon, typeByteCount, and typeByteOffset. Use of these types by 32-bit
    applications is optional; the toolbox provides automatic coercion between the old types and the new
    types where needed (typeRefCon), so existing apps will continue to run, and you may recompile an
    existing 32-bit app on Mac OS X 10.5 without modification to use these types. However, you must use
    these new types in order to work properly with the 64-bit API.
    
    The actual value of these constants is dependent on whether you are compiling for a 32-bit or 64-bit
    target, and in the case of typeRefCon, on the value of the preprocessor macro
    MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED, which specifies the minimum Mac OS X system version on which your
    application will run.
    
    typeRefCon is always equal to typeVoidPtr for 64-bit targets. It is also equal to typeVoidPtr when
    compiling 32-bit targets for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but is equal to typeSInt32 when compiling for
    earlier versions of Mac OS X. The Carbon Event Manager in Mac OS X 10.5 and later will automatically
    convert between typeVoidPtr and typeSInt32 for 32-bit apps (but not for 64-bit apps).
    
    typeByteCount and typeByteOffset use typeUInt64 for 64-bit targets, and typeUInt32 for 32-bit targets.
    The parameters that have changed to use these types formerly used typeSInt32 (typeLongInteger), not
    typeUInt32, but in practice they always refer to positive values which the toolbox will convert
    automatically to/from typeUInt32, so no binary compatibility problem is introduced by using the new
    types in an application compiled on Mac OS X 10.5 and run on prior systems.
    
    When compiling your code using the Mac OS X 10.5 header files, if you don't care about 64-bit
    compilation, you may continue to use typeSInt32 or typeLongInteger to extract refcon, byte count,
    and byte offset parameters; the coercion handlers provided by the toolbox will convert event parameter
    data using typeVoidPtr, typeByteCount, or typeByteOffset to your requested data type. If you want
    code that will run cleanly on both 32-bit and 64-bit targets, you should modify your calls to
    GetEventParameter to use typeRefCon, typeByteCount, or typeByteOffset instead of typeSInt32 or
    typeLongInteger. Using these preferred types will allow your 32-bit application to run on both pre-10.5
    and 10.5 systems, and will allow your 64-bit application to run on 10.5 and later.
    
    Note that when extracting data from an event parameter of typeRefCon, the data type of the variable to
    which the parameter data is written should always be pointer-sized; i.e., use void* or SRefCon/URefCon/
    PRefCon, not SInt32. Using a 32-bit variable will fail on 64-bit targets. Similarly, when extracting data
    from an event parameter of typeByteCount or typeByteOffset, always use the corresponding basic data type
    (ByteCount or ByteOffset), and use sizeof(ByteCount) or sizeof(ByteOffset), not sizeof(SInt32) or
    sizeof(UInt32), to specify the amount of data that you need.

    typeRefCon is currently used by the following events:
    
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetLength
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetSelectedRange
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtr
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtrForLargestBuffer
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharacters
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetFont
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetGlyphInfo
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetFirstRectForRange
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessLockDocument
        kEventTSMDocumentAccessUnlockDocument
        kEventTextInputUpdateActiveInputArea
        kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent
        kEventTextInputOffsetToPos
        kEventTextInputPosToOffset
        kEventTextInputShowHideBottomWindow
        kEventTextInputGetSelectedText
        kEventTextInputFilterText
        kEventAppLaunchNotification
        kEventControlArbitraryMessage
        
    typeByteCount is currently used by the following events:
    
        kEventControlSetData
        kEventControlGetData

    typeByteOffset is currently used by the following events:
    
        kEventTextInputPosToOffset

    In the case of graphics devices, some event parameters used typeGDHandle prior to Mac OS X 10.5.
    However, the GDHandle type is not available in 64-bit mode, and on Mac OS X 10.5, these parameters
    contain CGDirectDisplayIDs instead.
    
    We have defined a new event parameter type, typeCGDisplayID, to indicate that the data type of a
    graphics device event parameter is a CGDirectDisplayID instead of a GDHandle. We are not providing
    a generic type that changes its value based on the ABI or minimum required system version, because
    you will need to explicitly choose in your code which type of graphics device identifier you need.
    Use of typeCGDisplayID by 32-bit applications is optional; the toolbox provides automatic coercion
    between typeCGDisplayID and typeGDHandle, so existing apps will continue to run, and you may recompile
    an existing 32-bit app on Mac OS X 10.5 without modification to typeCGDisplayID. However, you must use
    typeCGDisplayID in order to work properly with the 64-bit API.
    
    typeCGDisplayID is currently used by the following events:
    
        kEventAppAvailableWindowBoundsChanged
        kEventWindowConstrain
        kEventMenuGetFrameBounds

 *  TrackMouseLocation()
 *  
 *  Discussion:

 *    mouse is currently located. While there is no activity, the
 *    current event loop is run, effectively blocking the current
 *    thread (save for any timers that fire). This helps to minimize
 *    CPU usage when there is nothing going on. 
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier, and CarbonLib 1.5 and earlier,
 *    TrackMouseLocation, TrackMouseLocationWithOptions, and
 *    TrackMouseRegion only support mouse-tracking when a mouse button
 *    is pressed. They cannot be used for mouse-tracking when no mouse
 *    button is pressed; if called when no button is pressed, they will
 *    simply block until a button is pressed and will not return when
 *    the mouse is moved. On Mac OS X 10.2 and CarbonLib 1.6 and later,
 *    TrackMouseLocation, TrackMouseLocationWithOptions, and
 *    TrackMouseRegion support mouse-tracking without a pressed mouse
 *    button; TrackMouseLocation and TrackMouseLocationWithOptions
 *    return kMouseTrackingMouseMoved if the mouse is moved while no
 *    button is pressed, and TrackMouseRegion returns

    NOTE:  TSM dispatches events of the TSMDocumentAccess class only as Carbon events.  These
            are not converted for TSM clients that still install AppleEvent handlers for TSM events.
    NOTE:  Text Services dispatch these Carbon events through TSM's SendTextInputEvent API.
            Normally only used for TextInput class TSM events, but this SendTextInputEvent is a bit
            of a misnomer.  You should use it for TSMDocumentAccess class events as well.
*/
/*

    ** Document Access Text events **

    The following Text Access events are very similar in design to the CFString API.
    The entire document can be conceived as a flattened Unicode string, and the
    events in this interface can access any portion of it.  The GetSelectedRange() method
    allow a text service to obtain text near the insertion point (or selection), but access
    is by no means restricted to this vicinity.  Use the GetLength() method to obtain the
    size of the document.
    
    Supporting these events effectively provide hooks into the text engine, but it is
    understood that access to a document in this way is to be strictly Read-Only.  Where
    direct access to a document's content cannot be provided through a pointer, the requested
    text can be copied instead.  Situations where a pointer may not be available from the
    text engine include the following:
    
        -A pointer would require conversion of text in Mac encodings to Unicode
        -A pointer would require sparse Unicode text blocks to be flattened into a single
         buffer.

    The idea is to minimize copying and converting text encodings where possible.  The text
    service will typically begin by asking for a document pointer via
    kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtr.  If this fails, it will typically fallback to
    kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtrForLargestBuffer, specifying a location of interest.
    If this fails, it will fallback to kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharacters, specifying a range
    of interest.  Of course, when requesting small amounts of data such a few characters on either
    side of the insertion point, there is no obligation to optimize in this way.  It's valid to
    simply use kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharacters.
    
    The text engine is entirely free to deny a request for a text pointer for these or any other
    implementation specific reason.

 *          is being returned via kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyCTFontRef
 *          (Mac OS X 10.5 and later), but could be helpful if the

 *          with the ATSFontRef and the ideal font size differs enough
 *          from the font size that would be derived from the
 *          CTFontRef.  However, see comment under
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyCTFontRef pertaining to the
 *          importance of input method adoption of CTFont API.
 *           Note2:  This event parameter was originally typed as
 *          typeFloat which is also typeIEEE64BitFloatingPoint.
 *          However, a 'float' (see MacTypes.h) is really a 32 bit IEEE
 *          float.  Clients of this parameter have made the assumption
 *          that these types correspond with oneanother, and as long as
 *          the same assumption was made everywhere, this caused no
 *          problem.
 *          In Mac OS X 10.5 and later, this parameter has been
 *          re-typed as typeCGFloat, which references a Float32 on
 *          32-bit, and a double on 64-bit.  For compatibility, TSM
 *          will assume that when data of typeFloat is used in
 *          conjunction with this parameter, the data actually contains
 *          a 32-bit IEEE float, and will coerce this data accordingly
 *          when converting to/from typeCGFloat.
 *          NOTE2:  The above special-case coercion to/from typeFloat
 *          exists only on 32-bit.  Always use typeCGFloat on
 *          64-bit.

 *    --> kEventParamTSMDocAccessSendComponentInstance (in, typeComponentInstance)
 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and
 *          later.
 *          
 *          This parameter is provided by the input method originating
 *          the event.<BR> Required parameter.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTSMDocAccessSendRefCon (in, typeRefCon)
 *          TSM's SendTextInputEvent, called by an input method,
 *          inserts this parameter before dispatching the event to the
 *          user focus.
 *          Required Parameter.
 *          
 *          On Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier, this parameter uses
 *          typeSInt32, and you must retrieve it using that constant.
 *          On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, to support 64-bit refcon
 *          values, this parameter uses typeRefCon. For 64-bit
 *          compatibility, you must use typeRefCon when retrieving this
 *          parameter; for 32-bit targets, however, you may continue to
 *          use typeSInt32 if you wish, or switch to typeRefCon.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTSMDocAccessSendCharacterIndex (in, typeCFIndex)
 *          The location in the document for which the caller would
 *          like glyph information.<BR> Required parameter.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTSMDocAccessRequestedCharacterAttributes (in, typeUInt32)
 *          A TSMDocAccessAttributes bit field filled out with the
 *          information desired.
 *          Applicable values for this event are :
 *          kTSMDocAccessEffectiveRangeAttribute which requests the
 *          text range represented by a glyph.<BR> Required parameter.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyCTGlyphInfoRef (out, typeCTGlyphInfoRef)
 *          The CTGlyphInfoRef for the glyph used to display the range
 *          of text returned in the
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessEffectiveRange parameter.  If the
 *          glyph used is the one that would normally be derived, this
 *          parameter can be omitted.
 *          This is the PREFERRED method of accessing glyph info on Mac
 *          OS X 10.5 and later.
 *          
 *          For compatibility purposes, this parameter may be requested
 *          by an input method even when the application returns glyph
 *          information as a ATSUGlyphSelector via the
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyATSUGlyphSelector event
 *          parameter.  The toolbox provides automatic coercion between
 *          these two parameters.<BR> <BR> Optional reply parameter.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyATSUGlyphSelector (out, typeGlyphSelector)
 *          The ATSUGlyphSelector for the glyph used to display the
 *          range of text returned in the
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessEffectiveRange parameter.  If the
 *          glyph used is the one that ATSUI would normally derive,
 *          this parameter can be omitted.  This is the NON PREFERRED
 *          way of accessing glyph info on Mac OS X 10.5 and later, and
 *          this parameter will be deprecated in the future.  Use
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyCTGlyphInfoRef instead.
 *           
 *          For compatibility purposes, this parameter may still be
 *          requested even when the application returns glyph
 *          information via the CTGlyphInfoRef parameter
 *          kEventParamTSMDocAccessReplyCTGlyphInfoRef.  The toolbox
 *          provides automatic coercion between these two
 *          parameters.<BR> <BR> Optional reply parameter.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTSMDocAccessEffectiveRange (out, typeCFRange)
 *          The range of text displayed as a glyph ID or CID.
 *           Optional reply parameter.
 *          Return this information if
 *          kTSMDocAccessEffectiveRangeAttribute is specified in the

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *    Where the character range would best be described by multiple
 *    logical rectangles, this event should return the first such
 *    rectangle and the corresponding character subrange
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Input methods have a need to locate the on-screen position of a

 *    to the user about a range of text by using its bounding rectangle
 *    or byoverlaying some text with different font/attributes.
 *     The handler of this event should return arectangle for the
 *    largest character subrange of text, starting from the range
 *    beginning, that is drawn on a single line usingsimilar font,
 *    size, and style.
 *    If text overlay is desired, the CTFontRef(s) used over the
 *    character range can be obtained via
 *    thekEventTSMDocumentAccessGetFont event. The baseline to be
 *    used for drawing is determined by applying the returned
 *    BaselineDelta parameter to the bounding rectangle's origin.
 *     When the bounding rectangle returned corresponds to only a

    ** Document Access Lock/Unlock events **

*/
/*
 *  kEventClassTSMDocumentAccess / kEventTSMDocumentAccessLockDocument
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Notifies the app that it should not change its document's text
 *    content (on its own) while a text service is involved in a
 *    transaction.  The app should not allow changes, for example, by
 *    its secondary threads.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    These events define how a text service can obtain access to a
 *    document in a way that ensures data integrity during its
 *    transaction.  The primary motivation of these events is to
 *    prevent the application from letting its secondary threads modify
 *    the document while a text service is busy servicing an event,
 *    such as a key event, or some user interaction with text service
 *    provided UI such as a menu selection. Also, while the document is
 *    locked, a text service is free to request pointer access to the
 *    document's text content (if this is supported by the app's text
 *    engine.) These lock-related events should be implemented using a
 *    ref counting scheme. Most apps will not support this kind of
 *    threading, so implementation of these events in the text engine
 *    will be optional.   In most text engines, the implementation of
 *    these events should be trivial, i.e. just maintain a simple
 *    semaphore.  TSM itself will implicitly lock/unlock around normal
 *    entry points into a text service, such as when it delivers key
 *    events to an input method, but there may be times when document
 *    changes can be driven by an input method without TSM involvement,
 *    such as the Carbon events involved when the user interacts with
 *    some UI.  In this case, the input method must manage locking, if
 *    the app supports it.  However, the logic in an input method
 *    should not have to care whether TSM is in the call chain or
 *    not... and TSM should not have to care whether an input method
 *    will do the right thing. This is why the lock mechanism needs to
 *    be some kind of refcounting scheme instead of a simple on/off
 *    mechanism. This document lock support is completely optional on
 *    the part of the text engine (if it is not threaded).  TSM will
 *    implicitly lock/unlock the document around delivery of events to

 *          On Mac OS X 10.5, TSM supports the font attribute and the

 *          although this is the intended direction in the future.
 *           NOTE:  When a glyph info attribute is set for a particular
 *          text range, it is expected that a font attribute covers at
 *          least that same text range.  This is also important to

 *          NOTE3:  Even when this parameter is provided by an input

 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendText (in, typeUnicodeText)
 *          The text to be added to the inline input session. The data

 *          type created via NewTSMDocument: it will be typeChar for
 *          kTextService documents, or typeUnicodeText for
 *          kUnicodeDocument documents.
 *          Required Parameter if
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendAttributedString is not provided.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendUpdateRng (in, typeTextRangeArray)
 *          An array of text-range records (see TextRangeArray) that
 *          indicates how to update (a subrange of) the active input
 *          area (aka. inline input session).  The TextRange structures
 *          occur in pairs, the first of which identifies a subrange of
 *          the existing active input area (in the app's backing store,
 *          resulting from a previous UpdateActiveInputArea event) to
 *          be replaced by a new subrange of text, identified by the
 *          second TextRange in the pair.  The new text subrange is
 *          obtained from the contents of the
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter.  In general, the
 *          Nth array element, where N is even, specifies the range of
 *          old text to be updated and array element N+1 specifies the
 *          range of new text to replace the corresponding old text. 
 *          The fHiliteStyle field of the TextRange records is ignored
 *          in this parameter. NOTE:  There are some "loose ends" in
 *          the TSM event protocol that were never clearly defined, but
 *          which have been introduced over the years by input methods
 *          themselves, probably through some trial and error.  The
 *          conventions regarding this optional parameter seem to be as
 *          follows: If the UpdateRng parameter is missing from the
 *          event, the input method is requesting that the entire
 *          contents of the existing inline input session (if there is
 *          one) is to be replaced "wholesale" by the new text
 *          contained in the kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter. If
 *          the UpdateRng parameter exists, but contains no ranges
 *          (i.e. fNumOfRanges == 0), this seems to be hint from the
 *          input method that no text in the active input area is
 *          changing.  It may be that the existing active input area is
 *          being confirmed "as is", or that the input method is
 *          modifying its highlite attributes in some way, due to some
 *          user action, such as changing the selected clause or
 *          highlited subrange of text in the active input area, or
 *          that the input method is changing the caret position in the
 *          active input area (if it uses the kTSMHiliteCaretPosition
 *          hilite style). Depending on how your text engine draws
 *          hilite styles supported in the
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendHiliteRng parameter, you may or may
 *          not need to redraw the text itself, simply change the
 *          hilite. This parameter is optional and may not be present
 *          in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendHiliteRng (in, typeTextRangeArray)
 *          An array of text-range records (see TextRangeArray) that
 *          specifies how various subranges of the active input area
 *          are to be highlited, and possibly specifies caret position
 *          within the active input area. NOTE:  The text offsets used
 *          in the HiliteRng parameter are relative to the beginning of
 *          the active input area AFTER all text has been updated (per
 *          the SendUpdateRng parameter) and any (subrange of) text has
 *          been confirmed.  Specifically, if the entire text is being
 *          confirmed, it is clear that any contents of this parameter
 *          should be ignored, especially non-zero values
 *          kTSMHiliteCaretPosition. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendClauseRng (in, typeOffsetArray)
 *          An array of offsets (see OffsetArray) used by an input
 *          method to specify word or clause boundaries in the
 *          resulting active input area.  Offsets are relative to the
 *          start of the resulting active input area. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be present in all instances of this
 *          event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendPinRng (in, typeTextRange)
 *          A TextRange record that specifies a start offset and an end
 *          offset that should be scrolled into view if the text
 *          specified by these offsets is not already in view. The
 *          fHiliteStyle field of the TextRange records is ignored in
 *          this parameter. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextServiceEncoding (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The encoding associated with the text sent by an input
 *          method. On MacOS X, this parameter is not commonly used
 *          because all TSM input methods produce Unicode, but TSM will
 *          respect a Unicode encoding variant here, if specified. In
 *          CarbonLib, this parameter identifies the Mac encoding
 *          (usually an encoding variant) of the text produced by the
 *          input method on MacOS, where it is not a requirement that
 *          input methods be Unicode-savvy.  On this platform, TSM
 *          needs the information to convert text to Unicode from a Mac
 *          encoding variant which cannot be derived from the
 *          ScriptLanguage record associated with the input method
 *          component. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextServiceMacEncoding (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The Mac encoding (variant) associated with the text sent by
 *          an input method. On Mac OS X, this parameter is needed by
 *          TSM to convert input method produced Unicodes to a Mac
 *          encoding when the application that has focus is not
 *          Unicode-savvy in the TSM sense... i.e. the current
 *          TSMDocument (as returned by TSMGetActiveDocument) is not of
 *          type kUnicodeDocument.  This parameter can also be useful
 *          if a Unicode-savvy handler should need to convert from
 *          Unicode.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be present in all
 *          instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray (in, typeGlyphInfoArray)
 *          A TSMGlyphInfoArray structure in which an input method can
 *          associate unencoded glyphs IDs and/or fonts with
 *          (sub)ranges of text it produces.  The array elements
 *          identify non-overlapping ranges of text and the glyph ID
 *          (character collection is 0) such as in an OpenType font, or
 *          the CID (collection is non-zero) such as in TrueType fonts.
 *           If the glyphID itself is 0, only the font specified is to
 *          be applied to the text range.  This is useful for
 *          characters in Unicode private use area, such as Windings,
 *          but note that this capability should be used with care
 *          because changing the font of an input text stream can lead
 *          to a confusing user interface. An input method will only
 *          include this parameter if the text engine has indicated it
 *          supports this feature via the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportGlyphInfoPropertyTag TSMDocumentProperty
 *          tag. For more information, see the Glyph Access protocol
 *          described in Technote TN2079. This parameter is optional
 *          and may not be present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendReplaceRange (in, typeCFRange)
 *          The CFRange in the application's document that should be
 *          replaced by the contents of the inline input session
 *          defined by other parameters in this event.  The text
 *          service will have obtained and calculated this range by
 *          accessing the document's text via events of the
 *          TSMDocumentAccess class.  This CFRange parameter refers to
 *          text in flat Unicode space (UniChar) offsets, and its
 *          location is document relative, not relative to the
 *          insertion point or any inline session. A text service may
 *          include this parameter only if the text engine has
 *          indicated it supports this feature via the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportDocumentAccessPropertyTag
 *          TSMDocumentProperty tag. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event. NOTE:  This
 *          parameter is supported by the TSM Carbon event only, not by
 *          TSM's kUpdateActiveInputArea AppleEvent.  If a text engine
 *          developer wishes to support this parameter, it must
 *          implement a Carbon event handler for this event and set the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportDocumentAccessPropertyTag property tag.
 *          NOTE:  Care must be exercised by the app when there is an
 *          active inline input session. A text service that sends an a
 *          UpdateActiveInputArea event specifying this parameter
 *          should not be the same text service that owns the inline
 *          input session, since the text engine would need to call
 *          FixTSMDocument().  This, in turn, would cause recursion
 *          through that same text service via FixTextService().
 *          However, the app should be prepared for recursion
 *          regardless of which text service owns the inline input
 *          session because it will call FixTSMDocument() to confirm
 *          the inline input session, and "somebody" will likely send
 *          an UpdateActiveInputArea event as a result. Therefore,
 *          document state obtained before the call to FixTSMDocument()
 *          may not be valid after this call completes.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    TSM will return tsmUnknownErr if the input method has specified
 *    an invalid component instance for this event's
 *    kEventParamTextInputSendComponentInstance parameter.

/*
 *  kEventClassTextInput / kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Provides Unicode text input resulting from either a key event
 *    (TSM originates the event in this case) or from a
 *    kEventTextInputUnicodeText event produced by an input method,
 *    such as a Character Palette class input method, or a HandWriting
 *    input method.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This is the primary event by which applications should receive
 *    text input on Mac OS X. Apple recommends that applications use
 *    this event rather than the kEventRawKeyDown event to handle text
 *    input. 
 *    
 *    A client need not be fully TSM-aware to process or receive this
 *    event. You can also get Mac encoding characters from the raw
 *    keyboard event contained in this event. If no UnicodeForKeyEvent
 *    handler is installed, and no kUnicodeNotFromInputMethod
 *    AppleEvent handler is installed (or the application has not
 *    created a Unicode TSMDocument), the Mac encoding charCodes (if
 *    these can be converted from the Unicodes) are provided to
 *    WaitNextEvent. 
 *    
 *    This event is generated automatically by TSM when a
 *    kEventRawKeyDown event is sent to the application event target.
 *    The typical keyboard event flow begins with a kEventRawKeyDown
 *    event posted to the event queue. This event is dequeued during
 *    WaitNextEvent or RunApplicationEventLoop, and sent to the event
 *    dispatcher target. If the keydown event reaches the application
 *    target, it is handled by TSM, which generates a
 *    kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent and sends it to the event
 *    dispatcher target. The event dispatcher will resend the event to
 *    the user focus target, which sends it to the focused control in
 *    the focused window.

 *          later.
 *          
 *          This parameter is provided by the input method originating
 *          the event. (Required parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendRefCon (in, typeRefCon)
 *          TSM's SendTextInputEvent, called by an input method,
 *          inserts this parameter before dispatching the event to the
 *          user focus.  (Required Parameter) 
 *          
 *          On Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier, this parameter uses
 *          typeSInt32, and you must retrieve it using that constant.
 *          On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, to support 64-bit refcon
 *          values, this parameter uses typeRefCon. For 64-bit
 *          compatibility, you must use typeRefCon when retrieving this
 *          parameter; for 32-bit targets, however, you may continue to
 *          use typeSInt32 if you wish, or switch to typeRefCon.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendSLRec (in, typeIntlWritingCode)
 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and
 *          later.
 *          
 *          The ScriptLanguageRecord associated with the text contained
 *          in the event. This parameter is normally provided by the
 *          input method originating the event.  TSM's
 *          SendTextInputEvent will construct this parameter from
 *          current script information as a result of a key event, or
 *          using input method provided information when TSM receives a
 *          kEventTextInputUnicodeText event.  (Required Parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendAttributedString (in, typeCFAttributedStringRef)
 *          The attributed string entered by the user.  This is the
 *          preferred event parameter on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  The
 *          attributes are those defined in CTStringAttributes.h.
 *           On Mac OS X 10.5, TSM supports the font attribute and the
 *          glyph info attribute.
 *          NOTE:  When a glyph info attribute is set for a particular
 *          text range, it is expected that a font attribute covers at
 *          least that same text range.  This is also important to
 *          allow TSM to coerce attributes to compatibility data
 *          structures, such as the
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray event parameter.
 *           NOTE2:  If this event parameter is missing and requested,
 *          it is coerced from the compatibility parameters provided in
 *          this event, in particular, kEventParamTextInputSendText and
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray.
 *          
 *          Required Parameter if kEventParamTextInputSendText is not
 *          provided.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendText (in, typeUnicodeText)
 *          The Unicode characters that entered by the user.
 *           Required Parameter if
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendAttributedString is not provided.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendKeyboardEvent (in, typeEventRef)
 *          This parameter is the original raw keyboard event that
 *          produced the text. It enables access to
 *          kEventParamKeyModifiers and kEventParamKeyCode parameters.
 *          Note that when contents of TSMs bottom-line input window
 *          are confirmed (i.e., during typing of Chinese, Korean, or
 *          Japanese), the raw keyboard events keyCode and modifiers
 *          are set to default values. 
 *          
 *          You can also extract from the RawKeyDown event either
 *          Unicodes or Mac encoding characters as follows:
 *          
 *          kEventParamKeyUnicodes      typeUnicodeText
 *           kEventParamKeyMacCharCodes  typeChar (if available)
 *           (DEPRECATED for 64bit on Mac OS X 10.6 and later.)
 *           
 *          The kEventParamKeyUnicodes parameter of the raw keyboard
 *          event is identical to the TextInput events
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray (in, typeGlyphInfoArray)
 *          A TSMGlyphInfoArray structure in which an input method can
 *          associate unencoded glyphs IDs and/or fonts with
 *          (sub)ranges of text it produces.  The array elements
 *          identify non-overlapping ranges of text and the glyph ID
 *          (character collection is 0) such as in an OpenType font, or
 *          the CID (collection is non-zero) such as in TrueType fonts.
 *           If the glyphID itself is 0, only the font specified is to
 *          be applied to the text range.  This is useful for
 *          characters in Unicode private use area, such as Windings,
 *          but note that this capability should be used with care
 *          because changing the font of an input text stream can lead
 *          to a confusing user interface. For more information, see

 *          
 *          On Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier, this parameter uses

 *          On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, to support 64-bit refcon

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextOffset (in, typeSignedByteOffset)
 *          Specifies a (signed) byte offset in an active input area
 *          for which the global position is desired.  Because an
 *          inline input session always begins at the insertion point,
 *          the offset is always considered relative to the insertion
 *          point, even when there is no active input area.  (Required
 *          Parameter) 
 *          
 *          On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, this parameter is typed as
 *          typeSignedByteOffset.  For all 32bit targets, whether for
 *          Mac OS X 10.5 or earlier, you can freely use this new
 *          type.
 *          For 64bit on Mac OS X 10.5 and later, in order to support
 *          64-bit text lengths, you must use typeSignedByteOffset.
 *          
 *          If an offset is outside the bounds of the document text,
 *          errOffsetInvalid should be returned.  Negative offsets are
 *          not valid when an inline input session exists, but are
 *          valid when none exists, to allow query of offsets before
 *          the insertion point.
 *          
 *          NOTE:  Non-zero offsets in the absence of an active input
 *          area can only be specified when the originator of the event
 *          is certain that the character encoding used by the target
 *          (the current TSMDocument) is the same as its own encoding. 
 *          When there is no active input area, TSM is unable to
 *          convert offsets between different encodings that might be
 *          used by the app and an input method (as it normally does)
 *          since TSM does not have access to the document text. 
 *          Practically, this means that both the originator and event
 *          target must be Unicode-savvy, i.e. the current TSMDocument
 *          was created with kUnicodeDocumentInterfaceType.
 *          
 *          NOTE:  Insertion point relative offsets when there is no
 *          active input area is contrary to the original definition of
 *          this parameter in IM-Text 7-74 which states that the offset
 *          is "relative to the start of the current text body" in this
 *          case.  However, most applications and text engines have
 *          already implemented the case offset = 0 as being the
 *          insertion point.  This allows an input method to display
 *          some UI near the the insertion point even before typing
 *          takes place.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendLeadingEdge (in, typeBoolean)
 *          Specifies which glyph on either side of the supplied text
 *          offset that should be used to compute the on-screen
 *          position returned.  This value is similar to the
 *          leadingEdge parameter of the QuickDraw PixelToChar
 *          function.  If this parameter is true, the location of the
 *          character (or characters if the glyph is represented by
 *          multiple characters) at the specified text offset is
 *          returned.  If this parameter is false, the on-screen
 *          position returned should be the trailing edge of the glyph
 *          represented by the character (or characters) immediately
 *          preceding (in memory order) the supplied text offset.
 *           Note also that while the on-screen position for a given
 *          offset and leading/trailing edge value is affected by this
 *          parameter, it also affects what should be returned for the
 *          other optional parameters at style run boundaries, such as
 *          script and font information.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be present in all

 *          The default value for this parameter is 'true'.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyPoint (out, typeHIPoint)
 *          The position on screen of the requested text offset and
 *          leading/trailing edge value.
 *          By default, this HIPoint is accessed in global coordinates,
 *          or 72dpi virtual coordinate Space, but can be accessed as
 *          any other type that specifies the desired coordinate
 *          space.
 *          This parameter was originally typed as typeQDPoint, but on
 *          Mac OS X 10.5 and later, it should be accessed as
 *          typeHIPoint.  The toolbox provides automatic type coercion
 *          between these two types.<BR> Required parameter.

 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplySLRec (out, typeIntlWritingCode)
 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and

 *          
 *          The ScriptLanguageRecord associated with the text at the

 *          ScriptLanguageRecord of the active input area if one
 *          exists, or of the text at the specified offset and
 *          specified leading/ trailing edge value.  At a script run
 *          boundary, such as where a Japanese text run ends, and a
 *          Roman begins, a leading edge value of 'true' should return
 *          the Roman script/language while a leading edge value of
 *          'false' should return the Japanese script/language.
 *           This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the

 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyCTFontRef (out, typeCTFontRef)
 *          The CTFontRef associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event.  This is the PREFERRED method of

 *          typeCTFontRef as the data type to retrieve this event
 *          parameter.
 *          
 *          This is either the font of the active input area if one

 *          of 'false' should return the Japanese font.
 *          
 *          Note:  For compatibility with applications that have not
 *          yet adopted the CTFont API, the toolbox will automatically
 *          coerce this parameter, if not present, from

 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyFMFont or
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyFont) and the font size parameter
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize.
 *          
 *          Note2:  This parameter is particularly important for input
 *          methods to adopt, because it will allow them to reproduce
 *          application text with much higher fidelity in its own UI
 *          when the application also adopts CTFont. If the ATSFont and
 *          FontSize info do not allow enough fidelity for your needs,
 *          that's a sign that your input method should adopt CTFontRef
 *          parameters in TSM events.
 *          
 *          If this CTFontRef parameter is provided, the following
 *          event parameters are not needed (but see note under
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize):
 *          
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize
 *           kEventParamTextInputReplyLineHeight
 *           kEventParamTextInputReplyLineAscent
 *          
 *          Optional reply parameter if

 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyFMFont or
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyFont) and
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize are provided.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyATSFont (out, typeATSFontRef)
 *          The ATSFontRef associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event. This is either the font of the
 *          active input area if one exists, or of the text at the
 *          specified offset and specified leading/trailing edge value.
 *           At a font run boundary, such as where a Japanese text run
 *          ends, and a Roman begins, a leading edge value of 'true'
 *          should return the font of the Roman text run while a
 *          leading edge value of 'false' should return the Japanese
 *          font.
 *          
 *          This is the recommended "compatibility" method of accessing
 *          font info on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  The QD font and
 *          FMFont parameters (see kEventParamTextInputReplyFMFont and
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyFont) are deprecated in all cases,
 *          and not supported on 64-bit.
 *          Note:  For compatibility with applications that have not
 *          yet adopted the CTFont API, the toolbox will automatically
 *          coerce this parameter, if not present, from

 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize are provided.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyFMFont (out, typeUInt32)
 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and
 *          later.
 *          
 *          The FMFont associated with the text at the offset specified
 *          in the event, either the FMFont of the active input area if
 *          one exists, or of the text at the specified offset and
 *          specified leading/ trailing edge value.  At a font run
 *          boundary, such as where a Japanese text run ends, and a
 *          Roman begins, a leading edge value of 'true' should return
 *          the font of the Roman text run while a leading edge value
 *          of 'false' should return the Japanese font.
 *          This parameter allows the handler to return an FMFont when
 *          a FMFontFamily or FOND would be inconvenient to
 *          compute.
 *          This parameter is NOT SUPPORTED on 64-bit.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the
 *          caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyFont (out, typeSInt32)
 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and
 *          later.
 *          
 *          The QD Font associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the QD Font of the active
 *          input area if one exists, or of the text at the specified
 *          offset and specified leading/ trailing edge value.  At a

 *          return the font of the Roman text run while a leading edge
 *          value of 'false' should return the Japanese font.
 *          This parameter is NOT SUPPORTED on 64-bit.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the

 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize (out, typeCGFloat)
 *          If the kEventParamTextInputReplyCTFontRef parameter is
 *          accessed using typeCTFontRef, this parameter is not used
 *          (Mac OS X 10.5 and later).
 *          
 *          The point size associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the point size of the active
 *          input area if one exists, or of the text at the specified
 *          offset.  At a style run boundary where point size changes,
 *          the leadingEdge parameter determines which point size
 *          should be returned.
 *          
 *          Note:  This parameter is not normally used if a CTFontRef
 *          is being returned via kEventParamTextInputReplyCTFontRef
 *          (Mac OS X 10.5 and later), but could be helpful if the
 *          context in which the ATSFontRef is used (such as the use of
 *          an affine transform) would produce a font size different
 *          from the font size that would be derived from the
 *          CTFontRef.  However, see comment under
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyCTFontRef pertaining to the
 *          importance of input method adoption of CTFont API.
 *          
 *          Note2:  This parameter was originally typed as typeFixed
 *          for QD font and FMFont, but should be inserted as
 *          typeCGFloat when an ATSFontRef is returned via
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyATSFont.    The toolbox provides
 *          automatic type coercion between typeFixed and typeCGFloat
 *          on 32-bit.  Always use typeCGFloat on 64-bit.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the

 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyLineHeight (out, typeCGFloat)
 *          If the kEventParamTextInputReplyCTFontRef parameter is
 *          accessed using typeCTFontRef, this parameter is not used
 *          (Mac OS X 10.5 and later).
 *          
 *          The line height associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the line height of the
 *          active input area if one exists, or of the text at the
 *          specified offset. At a style run boundary where point size
 *          changes, the leadingEdge parameter determines which line
 *          height should be returned.
 *          By default, this value is accessed in global coordinate
 *          space, or 72dpi virtual coordinate Space, but can be
 *          accessed as any other type that specifies the desired
 *          coordinate space, i.e. in Screen Pixel space.
 *          
 *          NOTE:  This parameter was originally typed as typeSInt16

 *

 *          specified in the event, either the line ascent of the

 *          specified offset.  At a style run boundary where point size
 *          changes, the leadingEdge parameter determines which line
 *          ascent should be returned.
 *          By default, this value is accessed in global coordinate

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendRefCon (in, typeRefCon)
 *          TSM's SendTextInputEvent, called by an input method,
 *          inserts this parameter before dispatching the event to the
 *          user focus.  (Required Parameter)
 *          
 *          On Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier, this parameter uses
 *          typeSInt32, and you must retrieve it using that constant.
 *          On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, to support 64-bit refcon
 *          values, this parameter uses typeRefCon. For 64-bit
 *          compatibility, you must use typeRefCon when retrieving this

 *          use typeSInt32 if you wish, or switch to typeRefCon.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendCurrentPoint (in, typeHIPoint)
 *          The point whose text offset (and classification) the input
 *          method is requesting. This point is usually the current
 *          mouse position.
 *          Text offset classifications are defined by

 *          between these two types.<BR> <BR> Required parameter.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendDraggingMode (in, typeBoolean)
 *          A Boolean value that indicates whether the input method is
 *          currently tracking the mouse -- that is, whether the user
 *          is dragging the current selection. If it is TRUE, the
 *          application should pin the cursor to the limits of the
 *          active input area (to avoid highlighting beyond the limits
 *          of the active input area).
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be present in all
 *          instances of this event.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyTextOffset (out, typeByteOffset)
 *          The text offset (ByteOffset) corresponding to the supplied
 *          point. If the click is within the limits of the active
 *          input area, the offset is relative to the start of the
 *          active input area. Otherwise, the offset is relative to the
 *          start of the application's text body.  This offset is
 *          always a positive value. (Required reply parameter)
 *           
 *          On Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier, this parameter uses

 *          continue to use typeSInt32 if you wish, or switch to
 *          typeByteOffset which is really typeUInt32 to which the
 *          toolbox will automatically convert because this parameter
 *          always contains positive values.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyRegionClass (out, typeSInt32)
 *          The classification of the offset parameter.  The values
 *          kTSMOutsideOfBody and kTSMInsideOfBody means that the
 *          position is outside or inside of the text body,
 *          respectively.  A value of kTSMInsideOfActiveInputArea means
 *          that the position is inside of the active input area. 
 *          (Required reply parameter)
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyLeadingEdge (out, typeBoolean)
 *          Specifies whether the point supplied corresponds to the

 *          If the supplied point is on the leading edge of a glyph,
 *          this parameter contains the text offset of the character
 *          whose glyph is at the pixel location.  (If the glyph
 *          represents multiple characters, it returns the text offset
 *          of the first of these characters in memory.)  If the
 *          supplied point is on the trailing edge of a glyph, this
 *          parameter returns the text offset of the first character in

 *          compatibility, you must use typeRefCon when retrieving this
 *          parameter; for 32-bit targets, however, you may continue to
 *          use typeSInt32 if you wish, or switch to typeRefCon.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendLeadingEdge (in, typeBoolean)
 *          If there is a non-empty selection, this parameter should be
 *          ignored.  When the current selection is empty, i.e. an
 *          insertion point, and this parameter is NOT supplied, no
 *          text should be returned. If the current selection is empty
 *          and this parameter is supplied, return the character (or
 *          characters) representing the glyph on the side of the
 *          insertion point indicated by this leadingEdge parameter.
 *          This value is similar to the leadingEdge parameter of the
 *          QuickDraw PixelToChar function.  If this parameter is true,
 *          the character (or characters) at the insertion point is
 *          returned.  If this parameter is false, the character (or
 *          characters) immediately preceding (in memory order) the
 *          insertion point should be returned. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be present in all instances of this
 *          event. This parameter has no default value and no text
 *          should be returned when this parameter is ommited and there
 *          is no selected text.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextServiceEncoding (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The encoding associated with the text sent by an input
 *          method. On MacOS X, this parameter is not commonly used
 *          because all TSM input methods produce (and request)
 *          Unicode, but if specified, this may be a Unicode variant
 *          encoding. In CarbonLib on MacOS, this parameter identifies
 *          the Mac encoding (usually an encoding variant) of the text
 *          produced by the input method on MacOS, where it is not a
 *          requirement that input methods be Unicode-savvy.  On this
 *          platform, TSM needs the information to convert text to
 *          Unicode from a Mac encoding variant which cannot be derived
 *          from the ScriptLanguage record associated with the input
 *          method component. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputReplyAttributedString (in, typeCFAttributedStringRef)
 *          The attributed string for the text selection.  This is the
 *          preferred event parameter on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  The
 *          attributes are those defined in CTStringAttributes.h.
 *           On Mac OS X 10.5, TSM supports the font attribute and the
 *          glyph info attribute.
 *          NOTE:  When a glyph info attribute is set for a particular
 *          text range, it is expected that a font attribute covers at
 *          least that same text range.  This is also important to
 *          allow TSM to coerce attributes to compatibility data
 *          structures, such as the kEventParamTextInputGlyphInfoArray
 *          event parameter.
 *          NOTE2:  If this event parameter is missing and requested,
 *          it is coerced from the compatibility parameters provided in
 *          this event, in particular, kEventParamTextInputReplyText
 *          and kEventParamTextInputGlyphInfoArray.
 *          
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the
 *          caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyText (out, typeUnicodeText)
 *          The data type of this parameter actually depends on the
 *          TSMDocument type created via NewTSMDocument: it should be
 *          typeChar for kTextService documents, or typeUnicodeText for
 *          kUnicodeDocument documents.
 *          This parameter has been deprecated in favor of
 *          kEventParamTextInputReplyAttributedString on Mac OS X 10.5

 *          This event parameter is DEPRECATED on Mac OS X 10.5 and

 *          
 *          The ScriptLanguageRecord of the script run containing the
 *          text being returned to an input method. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyMacEncoding (out, typeUInt32)
 *          The Mac encoding (variant) associated with the text
 *          returned to the input method. On Mac OS X, this parameter
 *          may needed by TSM to convert application produced text from
 *          a Mac encoding to Unicodes returned to the input method.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be returned to the
 *          caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputGlyphInfoArray (out, typeGlyphInfoArray)
 *          A TSMGlyphInfoArray structure in which the event handler
 *          can associate unencoded glyphs IDs and/or fonts with
 *          (sub)ranges of text it returns.  The array elements
 *          identify non-overlapping ranges of text and the glyph ID
 *          (character collection is 0) such as in an OpenType font, or
 *          the CID (collection is non-zero) such as in TrueType fonts.
 *           If the glyphID itself is 0, only the font specified is to
 *          be applied to the text range.  This is useful for
 *          characters in Unicode private use area. For more
 *          information, see the Glyph Access protocol described in
 *          Technote TN2079. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          returned to the caller. NOTE:  This parameter should really
 *          have been kEventParamTextInputReplyGlyphInfoArray, which
 *          was introduced after glyphInfo support was added to this
 *          event, but we can't change it now without breaking binary
 *          compatibility.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    TSM will return tsmUnknownErr if the input method has specified
 *    an invalid component instance for this event's

 *    which case TSM will convert the event into a UnicodeForKey event
 *    (converting the Unicodes to Mac charCodes and synthesizing

 *    
 *    This event is dispatched for any kEventClassMouse event except

    @discussion     This is the lowest-level keyboard input event. When this event is sent, the keyboard
                    input has not yet been processed by the Text Services Manager or passed to input methods.
                    Usually, you should not handle this event, because doing so may interfere with input
                    methods; instead, you should handle the kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent event, which
                    is sent after input methods have handled the raw key event, and contains both Unicode
                    and the original keyboard event.
                    
                    This event has a default handler on the application event target. The default handler
                    calls the Text Services Manager to pass the event through to input methods. The default
                    handler also implements certain standard keyboard equivalents, such as cmd-` for intra-
                    process window rotation and the universal keyboard access equivalents for interprocess
                    window rotation and document, floating, toolbar, and menubar keyboard focus.

 *    applications that would like to do their own window layout may
 *    install a handler for this event, and also set the

 *    the basic window handler to ignore kEventWindowConstrain. An

 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent when your application has customized either

 *    SetApplicationDockTileImage, OverlayApplicationDockTileImage,

 *    redraw its Dock tile in response to this event. This event is not
 *    sent if your application has not customized any of its Dock
 *    tiles. 
 *    
 *    This event is currently sent in two cases: when the Dock tile
 *    changes size (typically in response to a change in the user
 *    interface scale factor), or when the Dock process is restarted.
 *    In either case, any customization that your application has

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The RunApplicationEventLoop API installs a default handler on the
 *    application target for this event while the event loop is
 *    running. The handler is removed before RunApplicationEventLoop
 *    returns.
 *    
 *    The handler installed by RunApplicationEventLoop will call

 *    
 *    It is not possible to get the AppleEvent itself from this Carbon
 *    event; only its event class and kind are available. To inspect
 *    the AppleEvent parameters, the event must actually be dispatched
 *    using AEProcessAppleEvent.
 *    
 *    If you need to handle this Carbon event yourself, on Mac OS X
 *    10.5 and later you may simply call the AEProcessEvent API. On Mac
 *    OS X 10.4 and earlier, the necessary steps are: (1) remove the
 *    Carbon event from the queue. The AppleEvent requires some special
 *    preparation before it can be processed, and this preparation only
 *    occurs when the event is dequeued. You may choose to ignore the
 *    return value from RemoveEventFromQueue, since in some cases the
 *    event will have already been removed from the queue. In those
 *    cases, calling RemoveEventFromQueue is unnecessary, and will
 *    return an error, but is also harmless. (2) Use
 *    ConvertEventRefToEventRecord to get an EventRecord from the
 *    Carbon event. (3) Call AEProcessAppleEvent on the EventRecord.

    On window handlers:
    
    All windows have a handler installed called the basic window handler. This handler provides certain
    basic services for all windows; for example, it handles clicks in the collapse and toolbar buttons,
    since these buttons were handled automatically for WaitNextEvent-based applications in the classic
    Mac OS toolbox, and so are still be handled automatically in Carbon by the basic window handler. The
    basic window handler also implements the HICommands that are sent by the standard window menu to minimize,
    maximize, or zoom a window (kHICommandMinimize/Maximize/ZoomWindow), and the window-class events that are
    generated by those commands (kEventWindowCollapse/Expand/Zoom).
    
    When the window is created with, or has added, the kWindowStandardHandlerAttribute, the window also has
    installed the standard window handler. The standard handler provides much more advanced behavior than
    the basic window handler; a window using the standard handler generally requires no other extra handlers
    to move, resize, redraw, or track user clicks in controls. Applications will generally add extra handlers
    to respond to command events generated by controls in the window.

 *    
 *    If all handlers for this event return eventNotHandledErr, and the
 *    application is calling WaitNextEvent or GetNextEvent, then a
 *    kEventWindowUpdate event will be returned as a classic updateEvt.
 *

 *  Summary:

 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent by the standard window handler when it
 *    receives a kEventWindowUpdate event. BeginUpdate, SetPort, and
 *    EndUpdate are called by the standard handler inside its
 *    kEventWindowUpdate handler; your handler for the
 *    kEventWindowDrawContent event only needs to draw into the current
 *    port. 
 *    
 *    The standard window handler responds to this event by calling
 *    UpdateControls. 
 *    
 *    Regardless of whether the window uses the standard window event
 *    handler, you will also receive this event right before a window
 *    is made visible, to allow you to draw the windows initial
 *    contents; you can implement this event to avoid flicker when the
 *    window is first shown. 
 *    
 *    This event is only sent to non-compositing windows. To draw the
 *    contents of a compositing window, use a kEventControlDraw handler
 *    on an HIView in the window.

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent when a click occurs in a window that is not

 *    
 *    For all windows, it is sent to a clicked window when the window's
 *    process is inactive. For windows that use the standard window
 *    event handler, this event is also sent to clicked windows when
 *    the window's process is active. 
 *    
 *    A handler for this event can determine whether the window is
 *    activated and whether the click is handled or ignored by setting
 *    the kEventParamClickActivation parameter to one of the
 *    ClickActivationResult constants in Controls.h. 
 *    
 *    The default behavior varies according to the window state and the
 *    click location:
 *    - if the click falls on the window widgets in the window
 *    structure, then the default window event handler usually returns
 *    kDoNotActivateAndHandleClick.
 *    - otherwise, the standard window event handler returns

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Determines whether a mouse-down or mouse-up event is blocked by a

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent to a window by the event dispatcher target
 *    prior to dispatching a mouse-down or mouse-up event to the
 *    clicked window. A handler for this event may examine application
 *    state to determine whether this click should be allowed. 
 *    
 *    This event may also be sent in other circumstances besides a
 *    mouse event. The toolbox currently sends this event in the
 *    following other cases:
 *    
 *    - in SelectWindow
 *    - when handling the cmd-~ key sequence
 *    - when restoring a collapsed window from the Dock
 *    - when handling the kHICommandSelectWindow command
 *    - during application activation, when activating a clicked
 *    window
 *    
 *    In each case, the result of this event is used to determine
 *    whether z-ordering, activation, and hiliting of the window should
 *    be allowed. 
 *    
 *    This event contains an optional EventRef parameter that is the
 *    original mouse event. This parameter is not always present; if
 *    not present, the handler should generally assume that the click
 *    was a single click. 
 *    
 *    There is a default handler for this event installed on the
 *    application target. The default behavior is to determine whether
 *    this is a modal click by examining the modality of the visible,
 *    uncollapsed windows in front of the clicked window, the location
 *    of the click, and the keyboard modifiers. A custom handler may,
 *    of course, entirely ignore window z-order or modality, and
 *    determine modality in any way it deems necessary.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamKeyModifiers (in, typeUInt32)

 *          button was pressed.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamEventRef (in, typeEventRef)
 *          The original mouse event. This parameter is optional and
 *          may not be present in all instances of this event. If this
 *          parameter is not present, the handler should assume that
 *          the click was a single click, with the window part and
 *          keyboard modifiers specified by the other parameters in the
 *          kEventWindowGetClickModality event.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamModalClickResult (out, typeModalClickResult)
 *          On exit, this parameter should contain an
 *          HIModalClickResult value indicating how the click should be
 *          handled.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamModalWindow (out, typeWindowRef)
 *          On exit, this parameter should contain the modal window
 *          that caused the click to be blocked, if any. The sender of
 *          this event uses this information to determine which window
 *          should be activated if the application is inactive.
 *          
 *          
 *          This parameter is only required if the
 *          kEventParamModalClickResult parameter contains
 *          kHIModalClickIsModal. If an event handler wants to report
 *          that a click has been blocked by modality, but cannot
 *          determine which window blocked the click, it is acceptable
 *          to either not add this parameter to the event, or to set
 *          the parameter to a NULL WindowRef.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamWindowModality (out, typeWindowModality)
 *          On exit, this parameter should contain the modality of the
 *          modal window that is in front of the clicked window, if
 *          any. This parameter is only required if the
 *          kEventParamModalClickResult parameter contains

 *  kEventClassWindow / kEventWindowBoundsChanging
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Notification that a windows bounds are about to be changed.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Sent during DragWindow or ResizeWindow, before the window is
 *    actually moved or resized, and also during programmatic
 *    bounds-changing APIs such as SetWindowBounds and ZoomWindow. An
 *    event handler may alter the kEventParamCurrentBounds parameter in
 *    the event to change the eventual location of the window. You may
 *    change the size, origin, or both of the windows bounds. Do not,
 *    however, call SizeWindow or SetWindowBounds yourself from inside
 *    a handler for this event. 
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.1 and later, kEventWindowBoundsChanging is sent
 *    before all changes to a windows bounds, regardless of whether
 *    the change is initiated by the user or by a direct call to a
 *    Window Manager API. Applications may intercept the event and
 *    modify the bounds. When the event is sent because of a direct
 *    call to the Window Manager, the
 *    kWindowBoundsChangeUserDrag/Resize attribute bits will not be set.

 *          The windows original content bounds before the window
 *          resize or drag began.

/*
 *  kEventClassWindow / kEventWindowConstrain
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Requests that a windows position be constrained to the available
 *    window positioning bounds.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The basic window handler responds to this event by calling
 *    ConstrainWindowToScreen. This event is generated in three
 *    situations: changes in graphics device configuration, changes to
 *    Dock size, and (in Mac OS X 10.6 and later) after a window has
 *    been dragged. In each of these cases, a window which was
 *    previously visible onscreen may become obscured or be totally
 *    offscreen, and should be repositioned back inside the available
 *    window positioning bounds. 
 *    
 *    The behavior of the basic window handler may be customized by
 *    modifying the parameters to the event and then allowing the event
 *    to pass through to the basic handler, or an application may
 *    choose to override the event entirely and perform its own window
 *    constraining. 
 *    
 *    Applications may also use the
 *    kEventAppAvailableWindowBoundsChanged event to be notified of
 *    changes to a devices available bounds.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamDirectObject (in, typeWindowRef)
 *          The window being constrained.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamReason (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The reasons why the window is being constrained. This
 *          parameter contains one or more of the
 *          kAvailBoundsChangedFor constants. This parameter is
 *          available only on Mac OS X 10.3 and later. This parameter
 *          is not present on Mac OS X 10.6 and later if the event is
 *          being sent after a window drag.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTransactionID (in, typeUInt32)
 *          An integer which is the same for all instances of this
 *          event that are produced by the same configuration change.
 *          For example, if multiple displays are attached, then this
 *          event is sent once for each window on each affected display
 *          after a display configuration change; however, the
 *          transaction ID parameter will the same for each event, so a
 *          handler for this event can correlate events by observing
 *          the transaction ID. This parameter is available only on Mac
 *          OS X 10.3 and later.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamAvailableBounds (in, typeQDRectangle)
 *          The available window positioning bounds in which the window
 *          should be positioned. Event handlers may change the value
 *          in this parameter and then return eventNotHandledErr to
 *          allow the basic window handler to constrain the window to
 *          the new bounding rect. 
 *          
 *          This parameter is used by the basic window handler on Mac
 *          OS X 10.1 and later; on earlier versions of Mac OS X, the
 *          basic window handler always constrains the window to the
 *          rect returned by GetAvailableWindowPositioningBounds for
 *          the windows device.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamAttributes (in, typeUInt32)
 *          Window constraint options that should be passed to
 *          ConstrainWindowToScreen. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event. If present,
 *          this parameter should be formed from constants in the
 *          WindowConstrainOptions enumeration. 
 *          
 *          This parameter is used by the basic window handler on Mac
 *          OS X 10.2 and later; on earlier versions of Mac OS X, or if
 *          this parameter is missing, the basic window handler passes
 *          kWindowConstrainMoveRegardlessOfFit to
 *          ConstrainWindowToScreen in Mac OS X 10.0, and
 *          kWindowConstrainMoveRegardlessOfFit |
 *          kWindowConstrainAllowPartial in Mac OS 10.1 and later.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamWindowRegionCode (in, typeWindowRegionCode)
 *          A WindowRegionCode that should be passed to
 *          ConstrainWindowToScreen. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event. 
 *          
 *          This parameter is used by the basic window handler on Mac
 *          OS X 10.2 and later. On earlier versions of Mac OS X, or if
 *          this parameter is missing, the basic window handler passes
 *          kWindowDragRgn to ConstrainWindowToScreen.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamRgnHandle (in, typeQDRgnHandle)
 *          The GrayRgn before a graphics device configuration change.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be present in all
 *          instances of this event. It is present in events generated
 *          on Mac OS X 10.2 and later. 
 *          
 *          An event handler may compare this region with the current
 *          GrayRgn to more intelligently determine whether the window
 *          should be constrained to the current GrayRgn. The basic
 *          window handler in Mac OS X 10.2 will not constrain windows
 *          that were not onscreen before the device configuration
 *          change.
