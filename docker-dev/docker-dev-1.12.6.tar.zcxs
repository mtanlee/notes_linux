r file, print the line
number.

When resizing the Vim window, don't use 'equalalways'.  Avoids that making the
Vim window smaller makes split windows bigger.  And it's what the docs say.

When typing CTRL-D in Insert mode, just after an autoindent, then hitting CR
kept the remaining white space.  Now made it work like BS: delete the
autoindent to avoid a blank non-empty line results.

Added a GetHwnd() call to the OLE interface.  (Vince Negri)

Made ":normal" work in an event handler.  Useful when dropping a file on Vim
and for CursorHold autocommands.

For the MS-Windows version, don't change to the directory of the file when a
slash is used instead of a backslash.  Explorer should always use a backslash,
the user can use a slash when typing the command.

Timestamps:
- When a buffer was changed outside of Vim and regaining focus, give a dialog
  to allow the user to reload the file.  Now also for other GUIs than
  MS-Windows.  And also used in the console, when compiled with dialog
  support.
- Inspect the file contents to find out if it really changed, ignore
  situations where only the time stamp changed (e.g., checking the file out
  from CVS).
- When checking the timestamp, first check if the file size changed, to avoid
  a file compare then.  Makes it quicker for large (log) files that are
  appended to.
- Don't give a warning for a changed or deleted file when 'buftype' is set.
- No longer warn for a changed directory.  This avoids that the file explorer
  produces warnings.
- Checking timestamps is only done for buffers that are not hidden.  These
  will be checked when they become unhidden.
- When checking for a file being changed outside of Vim, also check if the
  file permissions changed.  When the file contents didn't change but the
  permissions did, give a warning.
- Avoid checking too often, otherwise the dialog keeps popping up for a log
  file that steadily grows.

Mapping <M-A> when 'encoding' is "latin1" and then setting 'encoding' to
"utf-8" causes the first byte of a multi-byte to be mapped.  Can cause very
hard to find problems.  Disallow mapping part of a multi-byte character.

For ":python" and ":tcl" accept an in-line script. (Johannes Zellner)
Also for ":ruby" and ":perl". (Benoit Cerrina)

Made ":syn include" use 'runtimepath' when the file name is not a full path.

When 'switchbuf' contains "split" and the current window is empty, don't split
the window.

Unix: Catch SIGPWR to preserve files when the power is about to go down.

Sniff interface: (Anton Leherbauer)
- fixed windows code, esp. the event handling stuff
- adaptations for sniff 4.x ($SNIFF_DIR4)
- support for adding sniff requests at runtime

Support the notation <A-x> as an alias for <M-x>.  This logical, since the Alt
key is used.

":find" accepts a count, which means that the count'th match in 'path' is
used.

":ls" and ":buffers" output shows modified/readonly/modifiable flag.  When a
buffer is active show "a" instead of nothing.  When a buffer isn't loaded
show nothing instead of "-".

Unix install:
- When installing the tools, set absolute paths in tools scripts efm_perl.pl
  and mve.awk.  Avoids that the user has to edit these files.
- Install Icons for KDE when the directories exist and the icons do not exist
  yet.

Added has("win95"), to be able to distinguish between MS-Windows 95/98/ME and
NT/2000/XP in a Vim script.

When a ":cd" command was typed, echo the new current directory. (Dan Sharp)

When using ":winpos" before the GUI window has been opened, remember the
values until it is opened.

In the ":version" output, add "/dyn" for features that are dynamically loaded.
This indicates the feature may not always work.

On Windows NT it is possible that a directory is read-only, but a file can be
deleted.  When making a backup by renaming the file and 'backupdir' doesn't
use the current directory, this causes the original file to be deleted,
without the possibility to create a new file.  Give an extra error message
then to warn to user about this.

Made CTRL-R CTRL-O at the command line work like CTRL-R CTRL-R, so that it's
consistent with Insert mode.

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-6*

All generated files have been moved out of the "src" directory.  This makes it
easy to see which files are not edited by hand.  The files generated by
configure are now in the "src/auto" directory.  For Unix, compiled object
files go in the objects directory.

The source archive was over the 1.4M floppy limit.  The archives are now split
up into two runtime and two source archives.  Also provide a bzip2 compressed
archive that contains all the sources and runtime files.

Added "reconfig" as a target for make.  Useful when changing some of the
arguments that require flushing the cache, such as switching from GTK to
Motif.  Adjusted the meaning of GUI_INC_LOC and GUI_LIB_LOC to be consistent
over different GUIs.

Added src/README.txt to give an overview of the main parts of the source code.

The Unix Makefile now fully supports using $(DESTDIR) to install to a specific
location.  Replaces the manual setting of *ENDLOC variables.

Added the possibility for a maintainer of a binary version to include his
e-mail address with the --with-compiledby configure argument.

Included features are now grouped in "tiny", "small", "normal", "big" and
"huge".  This replaces "min-features" and "max-features".  Using "tiny"
disables multiple windows for a really small Vim.

For the tiny version or when FEAT_WINDOWS is not defined: Firstwin and lastwin
are equal to curwin and don't use w_next and w_prev.

Added the +listcmds feature.  Can be used to compile without the Vim commands
that manipulate the buffer list and argument list (the buffer list itself is
still there, can't do without it).

Added the +vreplace feature.  It is disabled in the "small" version to avoid
that the 16 bit DOS version runs out of memory.

Removed GTK+ support for versions older than 1.1.16.

The configure checks for using PTYs have been improved.  Code taken from a
recent version of screen.

Added configure options to install Vim, Ex and View under another name (e.g.,
vim6, ex6 and view6).

Added "--with-global-runtime" configure argument.  Allows specifying the
global directory used in the 'runtimepath' default.

Made enabling the SNiFF+ interface possible with a configure argument.

Configure now always checks /usr/local/lib for libraries and
/usr/local/include for include files.  Helps finding the stuff for iconv() and
gettext().

Moved the command line history stuff into the +cmdline_hist feature, to
exclude the command line history from the tiny version.

MS-Windows: Moved common functions from Win16 and Win32 to os_mswin.c.  Avoids
having to change two files for one problem.  (Vince Negri)

Moved common code from gui_w16.c and gui_w32.c to gui_w48.c (Vince Negri)

The jumplist is now a separate feature.  It is disabled for the "small"
version (16 bit MS-DOS).

Renamed all types ending in _t to end in _T.  Avoids potential problems with
system types.

Added a configure check for X11 header files that implicitly define the return
type to int. (Steve Wall)

"make doslang" in the top directory makes an archive with the menu and .mo
files for Windows.  This uses the files generated on Unix, these should work
on MS-Windows as well.

Merged a large part of os_vms.c with os_unix.c.  The code was duplicated in
the past which made maintenance more work.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)

Updated the Borland C version 5 Makefile: (Dan Sharp)
- Fixed the Perl build
- Added python and tcl builds
- Added dynamic perl and dynamic python builds
- Added uninstal.exe build
- Use "yes" and "no" for the options, like in Make_mvc.mak.

Win32: Merged Make_gvc.mak and Make_ovc.mak into one file: Make_ivc.mak.  It's
much smaller, many unnecessary text has been removed. (Walter Briscoe)
Added Make_dvc.mak to be able to debug exe generated with Make_mvc.mak in
MS-Devstudio. (Walter Briscoe)

MS-Windows: The big gvim.exe, which includes OLE, now also includes
dynamically loaded Tcl, Perl and Python.  This uses ActivePerl 5.6.1,
ActivePython 2.1.1 and ActiveTCL 8.3.3

Added AC_EXEEXT to configure.in, to check if the executable needs ".exe" for
Cygwin or MingW.  Renamed SUFFIX to EXEEXT in Makefile.

Win32: Load comdlg32.dll delayed for faster startup.  Only when using VC 6.
(Vipin Aravind)

Win32: When compiling with Borland, allow using IME. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Win32: Added Makefile for Borland 5 to compile gvimext.dll. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

==============================================================================
BUG FIXES						*bug-fixes-6*

When checking the command name for "gvim", "ex", etc. ignore case.  Required
for systems where case is ignored in command names.

Search pattern "[a-c-e]" also matched a 'd' and didn't match a '-'.

When double-clicking in another window, wasn't recognized as double click,
because topline is different.  Added set_mouse_topline().

The BROKEN_LOCALE check was broken.  (Marcin Dalecki)

When "t_Co" is set, the default colors remain the same, thus wrong.  Reset the
colors after changing "t_Co". (Steve Wall)

When exiting with ":wqall" the messages about writing files could overwrite
each other and be lost forever.

When starting Vim with an extremely long file name (around 1024 characters) it
would crash.  Added a few checks to avoid buffer overflows.

CTRL-E could get stuck in a file with very long lines.

":au syntax<Tab>" expanded event names while it should expand groups starting
with "syntax".

When expanding a file name caused an error (e.g., for <amatch>) it was
produced even when inside an "if 0".

'cindent' formatted C comments differently from what the 'comments' option
specified. (Steve Wall)

Default for 'grepprg' didn't include the file name when only grepping in one
file.  Now /dev/null has been added for Unix.

Opening the option window twice caused trouble.  Now the cursor goes to the
existing option window.

":sview" and ":view" didn't set 'readonly' for an existing buffer.  Now do set
'readonly', unless the buffer is also edited in another window.

GTK GUI: When 'guioptions' excluded 'g', the more prompt caused the toolbar
and menubar to disappear and resize the window (which clears the text).
Now always grey-out the toplevel menus to avoid that the menubar changes size
or disappears.

When re-using the current buffer for a new buffer, buffer-local variables were
not deleted.

GUI: when 'scrolloff' is 0 dragging the mouse above the window didn't cause a
down scroll.  Now pass on a mouse event with mouse_row set to -1.

Win32: Console version didn't work on telnet, because of switching between two
console screens.  Now use one console screen and save/restore the contents
when needed.  (Craig Barkhouse)

When reading a file the magic number for encryption was included in the file
length. (Antonio Colombo)

The quickfix window contained leading whitespace and NULs for multi-line
messages. (David Harrison)

When using cscope, redundant tags were removed.  This caused a numbering
problem, because they were all listed.  Don't remove redundant cscope tags.
(David Bustos).

Cscope: Test for which matches are in the current buffer sometimes failed,
causing a jump to another match than selected. (David Bustos)

Win32: Buffer overflow when adding a charset name in a font.

'titlestring' and 'iconstring' were evaluating an expression in the current
context, which could be a user function, which is a problem for local
variables vs global variables.

Win32 GUI: Mapping <M-F> didn't work.  Now handle SHIFT and CTRL in
_OnSysChar().

Win32 GUI: (on no file), :vs<CR>:q<CR> left a trail of pixels down the middle.
Could also happen for the ruler.  screen_puts() didn't clear the right char in
ScreenLines[] for the bold trick.

Win32: ":%!sort|uniq" didn't work, because the input file name touches the
"|".  Insert a space before the "|".

OS/2: Expanding wildcards included non-existing files.  Caused ":runtime" to
fail, which caused syntax highlighting to fail.

Pasting a register containing CTRL-R on the command line could cause an
endless loop that can't be interrupted.  Now it can be stopped with CTRL-C.

When 'verbose' is set, a message for file read/write could overwrite the
previous message.
When 'verbose' is set, the header from ":select" was put after the last
message.  Now start a new line.

The hit-enter prompt reacted to the response of the t_RV string, causing
messages at startup to disappear.

When t_Co was set to 1, colors were still used.  Now only use color when t_Co
> 1.

Listing functions with ":function" didn't quit when 'q' or ':' was typed at
the more prompt.

Use mkstemp() instead of mktemp() when it's available, avoids a warning for
linking on FreeBSD.

When doing Insert mode completion it's possible that b_sfname is NULL.  Don't
give it to printf() for the "Scanning" message.

":set runtimepath-=$VIMRUNTIME" didn't work, because expansion of wildcards
was done after trying to remove the string.  Now for ":set opt+=val" and ":set
opt-=val" the expansion of wildcards is done before adding or removing "val".

Using CTRL-V with the "r" command with a blockwise Visual selection inserted a
CTRL-V instead of getting a special character.

Unix: Changed the order of libraries: Put -lXdmcp after -lX11 and -lSM -lICE
after -lXdmcp.  Should fix link problem on HP-UX 10.20.

Don't remove the last "-lm" from the link line.  Vim may link but fail later
when the GUI starts.

When the shell returns with an error when trying to expand wildcards, do
include the pattern when the "EW_NOTFOUND" flag was set.
When expanding wildcards with the shell fails, give a clear error message
instead of just "1 returned".

Selecting a Visual block, with the start partly on a Tab, deleting it leaves
the cursor too far to the left.  Causes "s" to work in the wrong position.

Pound sign in normal.c caused trouble on some compilers.  Use 0xA3 instead.

Warning for changing a read-only file wasn't given when 'insertmode' was set.

Win32: When 'shellxquote' is set to a double quote (e.g., using csh), ":!start
notepad file" doesn't work.  Remove the double quotes added by 'shellxquote'
when using ":!start". (Pavol Juhas)

The "<f-args>" argument of ":command" didn't accept Tabs for white space.
Also, don't add an empty argument when there are trailing blanks.

":e test\\je" edited "test\je", but ":next test\\je" edited "testje".
Backslashes were removed one time too many for ":next".

VMS: "gf" didn't work properly.  Use vms_fixfilename() to translate the file
name. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

After ":hi Normal ctermbg=black ctermfg=white" and suspending Vim not all
characters are redrawn with the right background.

When doing "make test" without +eval or +windows feature, many tests failed.
Now have test1 generate a script to copy the correct output, so that a test
that doesn't work is skipped.

On FreeBSD the Perl interface added "-lc" to the link command and Python added
"-pthread".  These two don't work together, because the libc_r library should
be used.  Removed "-lc" from Perl, it should not be needed.
Also: Add "-pthread" to $LIBS, so that the checks for functions is done with
libc_r.  Sigaltstack() appears to be missing from libc_r.

The Syntax sub-menus were getting too long, reorganized them and added another
level for some languages.

Visual block "r"eplace didn't work well when a Tab is partly included.
(Matthias Kramm)

When yanking a Visual block, where some lines end halfway the block, putting
the text somewhere else doesn't insert a block.  Padd with spaces for missing
characters.  Added "y_width" to struct yankreg. (Matthias Kramm)

If a substitute string has a multibyte character after a backslash only the
first byte of it was skipped. (Muraoka Taro)

Win32: Numeric keypad keys were missing from the builtin termcap entry.

When a file was read-only ":wa!" didn't force it to be written. (Vince Negri)

Amiga: A file name starting with a colon was considered absolute but it isn't.
Amiga: ":pwd" added a slash when in the root of a drive.

Don't let 'ttymouse' default to "dec" when compiled with dec mouse support.
It breaks the gpm mouse (Linux console).

The prototypes for the Perl interface didn't work for threaded Perl.  Added a
sed command to remove the prototypes from proto/if_perl.pro and added them
manually to if_perl.xs.

When ":w!" resets the 'readonly' option the title and status lines were not
updated.

":args" showed the current file when the argument list was empty.  Made this
work like Vi: display nothing.

"99:<C-U>echo v:count" echoed "99" in Normal mode, but 0 in Visual mode.
Don't set v:count when executing a stuffed command.

Amiga: Got a requester for "home:" because it's in the default runtime path.
Don't bring up a requester when searching for a file in 'path', sourcing the
.vimrc file or using ":runtime".

Win16 and Win32: Considered a file "\path\file" absolute.  Can cause the same
file to appear as two different buffers.

Win32: Renaming a file to an empty string crashed Vim.  Happened when using
explorer.vim and hitting ESC at the rename prompt.

Win32: strftime() crashed when called with a "-1" value for the time.

Win32 with Borland compiler: mch_FullName() didn't work, caused tag file not
to be found.

Cscope sometimes jumped to the wrong tag. (David Bustos)

OS/2: Could not find the tags file.  mch_expand_wildcards() added another
slash to a directory name.

When using ">>" the `] mark was not in the last column.

When Vim was compiled without menu support, filetype.vim was still trying to
source the menu.vim script. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)

":ptag" added an item to the tag stack.

Win32 IME: "gr" didn't use IME mode.

In the "vim --help" message the term "options" was used for arguments.  That's
confusing, call them "arguments".

When there are two windows, and a BufUnload autocommand for closing window #1
closed window #2, Vim would crash.

When there is a preview window and only one other window, ":q" wouldn't exit.

In Insert mode, when cancelling a digraph with ESC, the '?' wasn't removed.

On Unix glob(".*") returned "." and "..", on Windows it didn't.  On Windows
glob("*") also returned files starting with a dot.  Made this work like Unix
on all systems.

Win32: Removed old code to open a console.  Vimrun is now used and works fine.

Compute the room needed by the intro message accurately, so that it also fits
on a 25 line console. (Craig Barkhouse)

":ptnext" was broken.  Now remember the last tag used in the preview window
separately from the tagstack.

Didn't check for "-display" being the last argument. (Wichert Akkerman)

GTK GUI: When starting "gvim" under some conditions there would be an X error.
Don't replace the error handler when creating the xterm clipboard. (Wichert
Akkerman)

Adding a space after a help tag caused the tag not to be found.  E.g., ":he
autoindent ".

Was trying to expand a URL into a full path name.  On Windows this resulted in
the current directory to be prepended to the URL.  Added vim_isAbsName() and
vim_FullName() to avoid that various machine specific functions do it
differently.

":n *.c" ":cd .." ":n" didn't use the original directory of the file.  Vi only
does it for the current file (looks like a bug).  Now remember the buffer used
for the entry in the argument list and use its name (adjusted when doing
":cd"), unless it's deleted.

When inserting a special key as its name ("<F8>" as four characters) after
moving around in Insert mode, undo didn't work properly.

Motif GUI: When using the right mouse button, for some people gvim froze for
a couple of seconds (Motif 1.2?).  This doesn't happen when there is no Popup
menu.  Solved by only creating a popup menu when 'mousemodel' is "popup" or
"popup_setpos". (David Harrison)

Motif: When adding many menu items, the "Help" menu disappeared but the
menubar didn't wrap.  Now manually set the menubar height.

When using <BS> in Insert mode to remove a line break, or using "J" to join
lines, the cursor could end up halfway a multi-byte character. (Muraoka Taro)

Removed defining SVR4 in configure.  It causes problems for some X header
files and doesn't appear to be used anywhere.

When 'wildignore' is used, 'ignorecase' for a tag match was not working.

When 'wildignore' contains "*~" it was impossible to edit a file ending in a
"~".  Now don't recognize a file ending in "~" as containing wildcards.

Disabled the mouse code for OS/2.  It was not really used.

":mksession" always used the full path name for a buffer, also when the short
name could be used.
":mkvimrc" and ":mksession" didn't save 'wildchar' and 'pastetoggle' in such a
way that they would be restored.  Now use the key name if possible, this is
portable.

After recovering a file and abandoning it, an ":edit" command didn't give the
ATTENTION prompt again.  Would be useful to be able to delete the file in an
easy way.  Reset the BF_RECOVERED flag when unloading the buffer.

histdel() could match or ignore case, depending on what happened before it.
Now always match case.

When a window size was specified when splitting a window, it would still get
the size from 'winheight' or 'winwidth' if it's larger.

When using "append" or "insert" inside a function definition, a line starting
with "function" or "endfunction" caused confusion.  Now recognize the commands
and skip lines until a ".".

At the end of any function or sourced file need_wait_return could be reset,
causing messages to disappear when redrawing.

When in a while loop the line number for error messages stayed fixed.  Now the
line number is remembered in the while loop.

"cd c:/" didn't work on MS-DOS.  mch_isdir() removed a trailing slash.

MS-Windows: getftime() didn't work when a directory had a trailing slash or
backslash.  Didn't show the time in the explorer because of this.

When doing wildcard completion, a directory "a/" sorted after "a-b".  Now
recognize path separators when sorting files.

Non-Unix systems: When editing "c:/dir/../file" and "c:/file" they were
created as different buffers, although it's the same file.  Expand to a full
file name also when an absolute name contains "..".

"g&" didn't repeat the last substitute properly.

When 'clipboard' was set to "unnamed", a "Y" command would not write to "0.
Now make a copy of register 0 to the clipboard register.

When the search pattern matches in many ways, it could not always be
interrupted with a CTRL-C.  And CTRL-C would have to be hit once for every
line when 'hlsearch' is on.
When 'incsearch' is on and interrupting the search for a match, don't abandon
the command line.

When turning a directory name into a full path, e.g., with fnamemodify(),
sometimes a slash was added.  Make this consistent: Don't add a slash.

When a file name contains a "!", using it in a shell command will cause
trouble: ":!cat %".  Escape the "!" to avoid that.  Escape it another time
when 'shell' contains "sh".

Completing a file name that has a tail that starts with a "~" didn't work:
":e view/~<Tab>".

Using a ":command" argument that contains < and > but not for a special
argument was not skipped properly.

The DOS install program: On Win2000 the check for a vim.exe or gvim.exe in
$PATH didn't work, it always found it in the current directory.
Rename the vim.exe in the current dir to avoid this. (Walter Briscoe)

In the MS-DOS/Windows install program, use %VIM% instead of an absolute path,
so that moving Vim requires only one change in the batch file.

Mac: mch_FullName() changed the "fname" argument and didn't always initialize
the buffer.

MS-DOS: mch_FullName() didn't fix forward/backward slashes in an absolute file
name.

"echo expand("%:p:h")" with an empty file name removed one directory name on
MS-DOS.  For Unix, when the file name is a directory, the directory name was
removed.  Now make it consistent: "%:p" adds a path separator for all systems,
but no path separator is added in other situations.

Unix: When checking for a CTRL-C (could happen any time) and there is an X
event (e.g., clipboard updated) and there is typeahead, Vim would hang until a
character was typed.

MS-DOS, MS-Windows and Amiga: expanding "$ENV/foo" when $ENV ends in a colon,
had the slash removed.

":he \^=" gave an error for using \_.  ":he ^=" didn't find tag :set^=.  Even
"he :set^=" didn't find it.

A tags file name "D:/tags" was used as file "tags" in "D:".  That doesn't work
when the current path for D: isn't the root of the drive.

Removed calls to XtInitializeWidgetClass(), they shouldn't be necessary.

When using a dtterm or various other color terminals, and the Normal group has
been set to use a different background color, the background wouldn't always
be displayed with that color.  Added check for "ut" termcap entry: If it's
missing, clearing the screen won't give us the current background color.  Need
to draw each character instead.  Vim now also works when the "cl" (clear
screen) termcap entry is missing.

When repeating a "/" search command with a line offset, the "n" did use the
offset but didn't make the motion linewise.  Made "d/pat/+2" and "dn" do the
same.

Win32: Trying to use ":tearoff" for a menu that doesn't exist caused a crash.

OpenPTY() didn't work on Sequent.  Add a configure check for getpseudotty().

C-indenting: Indented a line starting with ")" with the matching "(", but not
a line starting with "x)" looks strange.  Also compute the indent for aligning
with items inside the () and use the lowest indent.

MS-DOS and Windows: ":n *.vim" also matched files ending in "~".
Moved mch_expandpath() from os_win16.c and os_msdos.c to misc1.c, they are
equal.

Macintosh: (Dany St-Amant)
- In Vi-compatible mode didn't read files with CR line separators.
- Fixed a bug in the handling of Activate/Deactivate Event
- Fixed a bug in gui_mch_dialog (using wrong pointer)

Multibyte GDK XIM: While composing a multibyte-word, if user presses a
mouse button, then the word is removed.  It should remain and composing end.
(Sung-Hyun Nam)

MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2: When reading from stdin, automatic CR-LF
conversion by the C library got in the way of detecting a "dos" 'fileformat'.

When 'smartcase' is set, patterns with "\S" would also make 'ignorecase'
reset.

When clicking the mouse in a column larger than 222, it moved to the first
column.  Can't encode a larger number in a character.  Now limit the number to
222, don't jump back to the first column.

GUI: In some versions CSI would cause trouble, either when typed directly or
when part of a multi-byte sequence.

When using multibyte characters in a ":normal" command, a trailing byte that
is CSI or K_SPECIAL caused problems.

Wildmenu didn't handle multi-byte characters.

":sleep 10" could not be interrupted on Windows, while "gs" could.  Made them
both work the same.

Unix: When waiting for a character is interrupted by an X-windows event (e.g.,
to obtain the contents of the selection), the wait time would not be honored.
A message could be overwritten quickly.  Now compute the remaining waiting
time.

Windows: Completing "\\share\c$\S" inserted a backslash before the $ and then
the name is invalid.  Don't insert the backslash.

When doing an auto-write before ":make", IObuff was overwritten and the wrong
text displayed later.

On the Mac the directories "c:/tmp" and "c:/temp" were used in the defaults
for 'backupdir' and 'directory', they don't exist.

The check for a new file not to be on an MS-DOS filesystem created the file
temporarily, which can be slow.  Don't do this if there is another check for
the swap file being on an MS-DOS filesystem.

Don't give the "Changing a readonly file" warning when reading from stdin.

When using the "Save As" menu entry and not entering a file name, would get an
error message for the trailing ":edit #".  Now only do that when the
alternate file name was changed.

When Vim owns the X11 selection and is being suspended, an application that
tries to use the selection hangs.  When Vim continues it could no longer
obtain the selection.  Now give up the selection when suspending.

option.h and globals.h were included in some files, while they were already
included in vim.h.  Moved the definition of EXTERN to vim.h to avoid doing it
twice.

When repeating an operator that used a search pattern and the search pattern
contained characters that have a special meaning on the cmdline (e.g., CTRL-U)
it didn't work.

Fixed various problems with using K_SPECIAL (0x80) and CSI (0x9b) as a byte in
a (multibyte) character.  For example, the "r" command could not be repeated.

The DOS/Windows install program didn't always work from a directory with a
long filename, because $VIM and the executable name would not have the same
path.

Multi-byte:
- Using an any-but character range [^x] in a regexp didn't work for UTF-8.
  (Muraoka Taro)
- When backspacing over inserted characters in Replace mode multi-byte
  characters were not handled correctly. (Muraoka Taro)
- Search commands "#" and "*" didn't work with multibyte characters. (Muraoka
  Taro)
- Word completion in Insert mode didn't work with multibyte characters.
  (Muraoka Taro)
- Athena/Motif GUI: when 'linespace' is non-zero the cursor would be drawn too
  wide (number of bytes instead of cell width).
- When changing 'encoding' to "euc-jp" and inserting a character Vim would
  crash.
- For euc-jp characters positioning the cursor would sometimes be wrong.
  Also, with two characters with 0x8e leading byte only the first one would be
  displayed.
- When using DYNAMIC_ICONV on Win32 conversion might fail because of using the
  wrong error number. (Muraoka Taro)
- Using Alt-x in the GUI while 'encoding' was set to "utf-8" didn't produce
  the right character.
- When using Visual block selection and only the left halve of a double-wide
  character is selected, the highlighting continued to the end of the line.
- Visual-block delete didn't work properly when deleting the right halve of a
  double-wide character.
- Overstrike mode for the cmdline replaced only the first byte of a multibyte
  character.
- The cursor in Replace mode (also in the cmdline) was to small on a
  double-wide character.
- When a multibyte character contained a 0x80 byte, it didn't work (was using
  a CSI byte instead). (Muraoka Taro)
- Wordwise selection with the mouse didn't work.
- Yanking a modeless selection of multi-byte characters didn't work.
- When 'selection' is "exclusive", selecting a word that ends in a multi-byte
  character used wrong highlighting for the following character.

Win32 with Make_mvc.mak: Didn't compile for debugging. (Craig Barkhouse)

Win32 GUI: When "vimrun.exe" is used to execute an external command, don't
give a message box with the return value, it was already printed by vimrun.
Also avoid printing the return value of the shell when ":silent!" is used.

Win32: selecting a lot of text and using the "find/replace" dialog caused a
crash.

X11 GUI: When typing a character with the 8th bit set and the Meta/Alt
modifier, the modifier was removed without changing the character.

Truncating a message to make it fit on the command line, using "..." for the
middle, didn't always compute the space correctly.

Could not imap <C-@>.  Now it works like <Nul>.

VMS:
- Fixed a few things for VAXC.  os_vms_fix.com had some strange CTRL-M
  characters. (Zoltan Arpadffy and John W. Hamill)
- Added VMS-specific defaults for the 'isfname' and 'isprint' options.
  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
- Removed os_vms_osdef.h, it's no longer used.

The gzip plugin used a ":normal" command, this doesn't work when dropping a
compressed file on Vim.

In very rare situations a binary search for a tag would fail, because an
uninitialized value happens to be half the size of the tag file. (Narendran)

When using BufEnter and BufLeave autocommands to enable/disable a menu, it
wasn't updated right away.

When doing a replace with the "c"onfirm flag, the cursor was positioned after
the ruler, instead of after the question.  With a long replacement string the
screen could scroll up and cause a "more" prompt.  Now the message is
truncated to make it fit.

Motif: The autoconf check for the Xp library didn't work.

When 'verbose' is set to list lines of a sourced file, defining a function
would reset the counter used for the "more" prompt.

In the Win32 find/replace dialog, a '/' character caused problems.  Escape it
with a backslash.

Starting a shell with ":sh" was different from starting a shell for CTRL-Z
when suspending doesn't work.  They now work the same way.

Jumping to a file mark while in a changed buffer gave a "mark not set" error.

":execute histget("cmd")" causes an endless loop and crashed Vim.  Now catch
all commands that cause too much recursiveness.

Removed "Failed to open input method" error message, too many people got this
when they didn't want to use a XIM.

GUI: When compiled without the +windows feature, the scrollbar would start
below line one.

Removed the trick with redefining character class functions from regexp.c.

Win32 GUI: Find dialog gives focus back to main window, when typing a
character mouse pointer is blanked, it didn't reappear when moving it in the
dialog window. (Vince Negri)

When recording and typing a CTRL-C, no character was recorded.  When in Insert
mode or cancelling half a command, playing back the recorded sequence wouldn't
work.  Now record the CTRL-C.

When the GUI was started, mouse codes for DEC and netterm were still checked
for.

GUI: When scrolling and 'writedelay' is non-zero, the character under the
cursor was displayed in the wrong position (one line above/below with
CTRL-E/CTRL-Y).

A ":normal" command would reset the 'scrollbind' info.  Causes problems when
using a ":normal" command in an autocommand for opening a file.

Windows GUI: a point size with a dot, like "7.5", wasn't recognized. (Muraoka
Taro)

When 'scrollbind' wasn't set would still remember the current position,
wasting time.

GTK: Crash when 'shell' doesn't exist and doing":!ls".  Use _exit() instead of
exit() when the child couldn't execute the shell.

Multi-byte:
- GUI with double-byte encoding: a mouse click in left halve of double-wide
  character put the cursor in previous char.
- Using double-byte encoding and 'selection' is "exclusive": "vey" and "^Vey"
  included the character after the word.
- When using a double-byte encoding and there is a lead byte at the end of the
  line, the preceding line would be displayed.  "ga" also showed wrong info.
- "gf" didn't include multi-byte characters before the cursor properly.
  (Muraoka Taro)

GUI: The cursor was sometimes not removed when scrolling.  Changed the policy
from redrawing the cursor after each call to gui_write() to only update it at
the end of update_screen() or when setting the cursor position.  Also only
update the scrollbars at the end of update_screen(), that's the only place
where the window text may have been scrolled.

Formatting "/*<Tab>long text", produced "* <Tab>" in the next line.  Now
remove the space before the Tab.
Formatting "/*<Tab>  long text", produced "* <Tab> long text" in the next
line.  Now keep the space after the Tab.

In some places non-ASCII alphabetical characters were accepted, which could
cause problems.  For example, ":X" (X being such a character).

When a pattern matches the end of the line, the last character in the line was
highlighted for 'hlsearch'.  That looks wrong for "/\%3c".  Now highlight the
character just after the line.

Motif: If a dialog was closed by clicking on the "X" of the window frame Vim
would no longer respond.

When using CTRL-X or CTRL-A on a number with many leading zeros, Vim would
crash. (Matsumoto)

When 'insertmode' is set, the mapping in mswin.vim for CTRL-V didn't work in
Select mode.  Insert mode wasn't restarted after overwriting the text.
Now allow nesting Insert mode with insert and change commands.  CTRL-O
cwfoo<Esc> now also works.

Clicking with the right mouse button in another window started Visual mode,
but used the start position of the current window.  Caused ml_get errors when
the line number was invalid.  Now stay in the same window.

When 'selection' is "exclusive", "gv" sometimes selected one character fewer.

When 'comments' contains more than one start/middle/end triplet, the optional
flags could be mixed up.  Also didn't align the end with the middle part.

Double-right-click in Visual mode didn't update the shown mode.

When the Normal group has a font name, it was never used when starting up.
Now use it when 'guifont' and 'guifontset' are empty.
Setting a font name to a highlight group before the GUI was started didn't
work.

"make test" didn't use the name of the generated Vim executable.

'cindent' problems:
- Aligned with an "else" inside a do-while loop for a line below that loop.
  (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- A line before a function would be indented even when terminated with a
  semicolon. (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- 'cindent' gave too much indent to a line after a "};" that ends an array
  init.
- Support declaration lines ending in "," and "\".  (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- A case statement inside a do-while loop was used for indenting a line after
  the do-while loop. (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- When skipping a string in a line with one double quote it could continue in
  the previous line. (Meikel Brandmeyer)

When 'list' is set, 'hlsearch' didn't highlight a match at the end of the
line.  Now highlight the '$'.

The Paste menu item in the menu bar, the popup menu and the toolbar were all
different.  Now made them all equal to how it was done in mswin.vim.

st_dev can be smaller than "unsigned".  The compiler may give an overflow
warning.  Added a configure check for dev_t.

Athena: closing a confirm() dialog killed Vim.

Various typos in the documentation. (Matt Dunford)

Python interface: The definition of _DEBUG could cause trouble, undefine it.
The error message for not being able to load the shared library wasn't
translated.  (Muraoka Taro)

Mac: (Dany St-Amant and Axel Kielhorn)
- Several fixes.
- Vim was eating 80% of the CPU time.
- The project os_mac.pbxproj didn't work,  Moved it to a subdirectory.
- Made the menu priority work for the menubar.
- Fixed a problem with dragging the scrollbar.
- Cleaned up the various #ifdefs.

Unix: When catching a deadly signal and we keep getting one use _exit() to
exit in a quick and dirty way.

Athena menu ordering didn't work correctly. (David Harrison)

A ":make" or ":grep" command with a long argument could cause a crash.

Doing ":new file" and using "Quit" for the ATTENTION dialog still opened a new
window.

GTK: When starting the GUI and there is an error in the .vimrc file, don't
present the wait-return prompt, since the message was given in the terminal.

When there was an error in a .vimrc file the terminal where gvim was started
could be cleared.  Set msg_row in main.c before writing any messages.

GTK and X11 GUI: When trying to read characters from the user (e.g. with
input()) before the Vim window was opened caused Vim to hang when it was
started from the desktop.

OS/390 uses 31 bit pointers.  That broke some computations with MAX_COL.
Reduce MAX_COL by one bit for OS/390. (Ralf Schandl)

When defining a function and it already exists, Vim didn't say it existed
until after typing it.  Now do this right away when typing it.

The message remembered for displaying later (keep_msg) was sometimes pointing
into a generic buffer, which might be changed by the time the message is
displayed.  Now make a copy of the message.

When using multi-byte characters in a menu and a trailing byte is a backslash,
the menu would not be created correctly.  (Muraoka Taro)
Using a multibyte character in the substitute string where a trail byte is a
backslash didn't work.  (Muraoka Taro)

When setting "t_Co" in a vimrc file, then setting it automatically from an
xterm termresponse and then setting it again manually caused a crash.

When getting the value of a string option that is not supported, the number
zero was returned.  This breaks a check like "&enc == "asdf".  Now an empty
string is returned for string options.

Crashed when starting the GTK GUI while using 'notitle' in the vimrc, setting
'title' in the gvimrc and starting the GUI with ":gui".  Closed the connection
to the X server accidentally.

Had to hit return after selecting an entry for ":ts".

The message from ":cn" message was sometimes cleared.  Now display it after
redrawing if it doesn't cause a scroll (truncated when necessary).

hangulin.c didn't compile when the GUI was disabled.  Disable it when it won't
work.

When setting a termcap option like "t_CO", the value could be displayed as
being for a normal key with a modifier, like "<M-=>".

When expanding the argument list, entries which are a directory name did not
get included.  This stopped "vim c:/" from opening the file explorer.

":syn match sd "^" nextgroup=asdf" skipped the first column and matched the
nextgroup in the second column.

GUI: When 'lazyredraw' is set, 'showmatch' didn't work.  Required flushing
the output.

Don't define the <NetMouse> termcode in an xterm, reduces the problem when
someone types <Esc> } in Insert mode.

Made slash_adjust() work correctly for multi-byte characters. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)
Using a filename in Big5 encoding for autocommands didn't work (backslash in
trailbyte).  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

DOS and Windows: Expanding *.vim also matched file.vimfoo.  Expand path like
Unix to avoid problems with Windows dir functions.  Merged the DOS and Win32
functions.

Win32: Gvimext could not edit more than a few files at once, the length of the
argument was fixed.

"ls -1 * | xargs vim" worked, but the input was in cooked mode.  Now switch to
raw mode when needed.  Use dup() to copy the stderr file descriptor to stdin
to make shell commands work.  No longer requires an external program to do
this.

When using ":filetype off", ftplugin and indent usage would be switched off at
the same time.  Don't do this, setting 'filetype' manually can still use them.

GUI: When writing a double-byte character, it could be split up in two calls
to gui_write(), which doesn't work.  Now flush before the output buffer
becomes full.

When 'laststatus' is set and 'cmdheight' is two or bigger, the intro message
would be written over the status line.
The ":intro" command didn't work when there wasn't enough room.

Configuring for Ruby failed with a recent version of Ruby. (Akinori Musha)

Athena: When deleting the directory in which Vim was started, using the file
browser made Vim exit.  Removed the use of XtAppError().

When using autoconf 2.50, UNIX was not defined.  Moved the comment for "#undef
UNIX" to a separate line.

Win32: Disabled _OnWindowPosChanging() to make maximize work better.

Win32: Compiling with VC 4.0 didn't work. (Walter Briscoe)

Athena:
- Finally fixed the problems with deleting a menu. (David Harrison)
- Athena: When closing the confirm() dialog, worked like OK was pressed,
  instead of Cancel.

The file explorer didn't work in compatible mode, because of line
continuation.

Didn't give an error message for ":digraph a".

When using Ex mode in the GUI and typing a special key, <BS> didn't delete it
correctly.  Now display '?' for a special key.

When an operator is pending, clicking in another window made it apply to that
window, even though the line numbers could be beyond the end of the buffer.

When a function call doesn't have a terminating ")" Vim could crash.

Perl interface: could crash on exit with perl 5.6.1. (Anduin Withers)

Using %P in 'errorformat' wasn't handled correctly. (Tomas Zellerin)

Using a syntax cluster that includes itself made Vim crash.

GUI: With 'ls' set to 2, dragging the status line all the way up, then making
the Vim window smaller: Could not the drag status line anymore.

"vim -c startinsert! file" placed cursor on last char of a line, instead of
after it.  A ":set" command in the buffer menu set w_set_curswant.  Now don't
do this when w_curswant is MAXCOL.

Win32: When the gvim window was maximized and selecting another font, the
window would no longer fill the screen.

The line with 'pastetoggle' in ":options" didn't show the right value when it
is a special key.  Hitting <CR> didn't work either.

Formatting text, resulting in a % landing in the first line, repeated the % in
the following lines, like it's the start of a comment.

GTK: When adding a toolbar item while gvim is already running, it wasn't
possible to use the tooltip.  Now it works by adding the tooltip first.

The output of "g CTRL-G" mentioned "Char" but it's actually bytes.

Searching for the end of a oneline region didn't work correctly when there is
an offset for the highlighting.

Syntax highlighting: When synchronizing on C-comments, //*/ was seen as the
start of a comment.

Win32: Without scrollbars present, the MS mouse scroll wheel didn't work.
Also handle the scrollbars when they are not visible.

Motif: When there is no right scrollbar, the bottom scrollbar would still
leave room for it.  (Marcin Dalecki)

When changing 'guicursor' and the value is invalid, some of the effects would
still take place.  Now first check for errors and only make the new value
effective when it's OK.

Using "A" In Visual block mode, appending to lines that don't extend into the
block, padding was wrong.

When pasting a block of text, a character that occupies more than one screen
column could be deleted and spaces inserted instead.  Now only do that with a
tab.

Fixed conversion of documentation to HTML using Perl. (Dan Sharp)

Give an error message when a menu name starts with a dot.

Avoid a hang when executing a shell from the GUI on HP-UX by pushing "ptem"
even when sys/ptem.h isn't present.

When creating the temp directory, make sure umask is 077, otherwise the
directory is not accessible when it was set to 0177.

Unix: When resizing the window and a redraw is a bit slow, could get a window
resize event while redrawing, resulting in a messed up window.  Any input
(e.g., a mouse click) would redraw.

The "%B" item in the status line became zero in Insert mode (that's normal)
for another than the current window.

The menu entries to convert to xxd and back didn't work in Insert mode.

When ":vglobal" didn't find a line where the pattern doesn't match, the error
message would be the wrong way around.

When ignoring a multi-line error message with "%-A", the continuation lines
would be used anyway. (Servatius Brandt)

"grx" on a double-wide character inserted "x", instead of replacing the
character with "x ".  "gR" on <xx> ('display' set the "uhex") didn't replace
at all.  When doing "gRxx" on a control character the first "x" would be
inserted, breaking the alignment.

Added "0)" to 'cinkeys', so that when typing a ) it is put in the same place
as where "==" would put it.

Win32: When maximized, adding/removing toolbar didn't resize the text area.

When using <C-RightMouse> a count was discarded.

When typing CTRL-V and <RightMouse> in the command line, would insert
<LeftMouse>.

Using "vis" or "vas" when 'selection' is exclusive didn't include the last
character.

When adding to an option like 'grepprg', leading space would be lost.  Don't
expand environment variables when there is no comma separating the items.

GUI: When using a bold-italic font, would still use the bold trick and
underlining.

Motif: The default button didn't work in dialogs, the first one was always
used.  Had to give input focus to the default button.

When using CTRL-T to jump within the same file, the '' mark wasn't set.

Undo wasn't Vi compatible when using the 'c' flag for ":s".  Now it undoes the
whole ":s" command instead of each confirmed replacement.

The Buffers menu, when torn-off, disappeared when being refreshed.  Add a
dummy item to avoid this.

Removed calling msg_start() in main(), it should not be needed.

vim_strpbrk() did not support multibyte characters. (Muraoka Taro)

The Amiga version didn't compile, the code was too big for relative jumps.
Moved a few files from ex_docmd.c to ex_cmds2.c

When evaluating the "= register resulted in the "= register being changed, Vim
would crash.

When doing ":view file" and it fails, the current buffer was made read-only.

Motif: For some people the separators in the toolbar disappeared when resizing
the Vim window. (Marcin Dalecki)

Win32 GUI: when setting 'lines' to a huge number, would not compute the
available space correctly.  Was counting the menu height twice.

Conversion of the docs to HTML didn't handle the line with the +quickfix tag
correctly. (Antonio Colombo)

Win32: fname_case() didn't handle multi-byte characters correctly. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

The Cygwin version had trouble with fchdir().  Don't use that function for
Cygwin.

The generic check in scripts.vim for "conf" syntax was done before some checks
in filetype.vim, resulting in "conf" syntax too often.

Dos32: Typing lagged behind.  Would wait for one biostick when checking if a
character is available.

GTK: When setting 'columns' while starting up "gvim", would set the width of
the terminal it was started in.

When using ESC in Insert mode, an autoindent that wraps to the next line
caused the cursor to move to the end of the line temporarily.  When the
character before the cursor was a double-wide multi-byte character the cursor
would be on the right halve, which causes problems with some terminals.

Didn't handle multi-byte characters correctly when expanding a file name.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Win32 GUI: Errors generated before the GUI is decided to start were not
reported.

globpath() didn't reserve enough room for concatenated results. (Anduin
Withers)

When expanding an option that is very long already, don't do the expansion, it
would be truncated to MAXPATHL. (Anduin Withers)

When 'selection' is "exclusive", using "Fx" in Visual mode only moved until
just after the character.

When using IME on the console to enter a file name, the screen may scroll up.
Redraw the screen then. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Motif: In the find/replace dialog the "Replace" button didn't work first time,
second time it replaced all matches.  Removed the use of ":s///c".
GTK: Similar problems with the find/replace dialog, moved the code to a common
function.

X11: Use shared GC's for text. (Marcin Dalecki)

"]i" found the match under the cursor, instead of the first one below it.
Same for "]I", "] CTRL-I", "]d", "]D" and "] CTRL-D".

Win16: When maximized and the font is changed, don't change the window size.
(Vince Negri)

When 'lbr' is set, deleting a block of text could leave the cursor in the
wrong position.

Win32: When opening a file with the "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry,
wildcards would cause trouble.  Added the "--literal" argument to avoid
expanding file names.

When using "gv", it didn't restore that "$" was used in Visual block mode.

Win32 GUI: While waiting for a shell command to finish, the window wasn't
redrawn at all. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Syntax highlighting: A match that continues on a next line because of a
contained region didn't end when that region ended.

The ":s" command didn't allow flags like 'e' and 'i' right after it.

When using ":s" to split a line, marks were moved to the next line.  Vi keeps
them in the first line.

When using ":n" ":rew", the previous context mark was at the top of the file,
while Vi puts it in the same place as the cursor.  Made it Vi compatible.

Fixed Vi incompatibility: Text was not put in register 1 when using "c" and
"d" with a motion character, when deleting within one line with one of the
commands: % ( ) `<character> / ? N n { }

Win32 GUI: The tooltip for tear-off items remained when the tear-off item was
no longer selected.

GUI: When typing ":" at the more prompt, would return to Normal mode and not
redraw the screen.

When starting Vim with an argument "-c g/at/p" the printed lines would
overwrite each other.

BeOS: Didn't compile.  Configure didn't add the os_beos files, the QNX check
removed them.  Various changes to os_beos.cc. (Joshua Haberman)
Removed the check for the hardware platform, the BeBox has not been produced
for a long time now.

Win32 GUI: don't use a message box when the shell returns an error code,
display the message in the Vim window.

Make_mvc.mak always included "/debug" for linking.  "GUI=no" argument didn't
work.  Use "DEBUG=yes" instead of "DEBUG=1" to make it consistent. (Dan Sharp)

When a line in the tags file ended in ;" (no TAB following) the command would
not be recognized as a search command.

X11: The inputMethod resource never worked.  Don't use the "none" input method
for SGI, it apparently makes the first character in Input method dropped.

Fixed incorrect tests in os_mac.h. (Axel Kielhorn)

Win32 console: When the console where Vim runs in is closed, Vim could hang in
trying to restore the window icon. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

When using ":3call func()" or ":3,3call func() the line number was ignored.

When 'showbreak' and 'linebreak' were both set, Visual highlighting sometimes
continued until the end of the line.

GTK GUI: Tearoff items were added even when 'guioptions' didn't contain 't'
when starting up.

MS-Windows: When the current directory includes a "~", searching files with
"gf" or ":find" didn't work.  A "$" in the directory had the same problem.
Added mch_has_exp_wildcard() functions.

When reducing the Vim window height while starting up, would get an
out-of-memory error message.

When editing a very long search pattern, 'incsearch' caused the redraw of the
command line to fail.

Motif GUI: On some systems the "Help" menu would not be on the far right, as
it should be.  On some other systems (esp. IRIX) the command line would not
completely show.  Solution is to only resize the menubar for Lesstif.

Using "%" in a line that contains "\\" twice didn't take care of the quotes
properly.  Now make a difference between \" and \\".

For non-Unix systems a dummy file is created when finding a swap name to
detect a 8.3 filesystem.  When there is an existing swap file, would get a
warning for the file being created outside of Vim.  Also, when closing the Vim
window the file would remain.

Motif: The menu height was always computed, using a "-menuheight" argument
was setting the room for the command line.  Now make clear the argument is not
supported.

For some (EBCDIC) systems, POUND was equal to '#'.  Added an #if for that to
avoid a duplicate case in a switch.

The GUI may have problems when forking.  Always call _exit() instead of exit()
in the parent, the child will call exit().

Win32 GUI: Accented characters were often wrong in dialogs and tearoff menus.
Now use CP_ACP instead of CP_OEMCP. (Vince Negri)

When displaying text with syntax highlighting causes an error (e.g., running
out of stack) the syntax highlighting is disabled to avoid further messages.

When a command in a .vimrc or .gvimrc causes an ATTENTION prompt, and Vim was
started from the desktop (no place to display messages) it would hang.  Now
open the GUI window early to be able to display the messages and pop up the
dialog.

"r<CR>" on a multi-byte character deleted only the first byte of the
character.  "3r<CR>" deleted three bytes instead of three characters.

When interrupting reading a file, Vi considers the buffer modified.  Added the
'i' flag in 'cpoptions' flag for this (we don't want it modified to be able to
do ":q").

When using an item in 'guicursor' that starts with a colon, Vim would get
stuck or crash.

When putting a file mark in a help file and later jumping back to it, the
options would not be set.  Extended the modeline in all help files to make
this work better.

When a modeline contained "::" the local option values would be printed.  Now
ignore it.

Some help files did not use a 8.3 names, which causes problems when using
MS-DOS unzip.  Renamed "multibyte.txt" to "mbyte.txt", "rightleft.txt" to
"rileft.txt", "tagsearch.txt" to "tagsrch.txt", "os_riscos.txt" to
"os_risc.txt".

When Visual mode is blockwise, using "iw" or "aw" made it characterwise.  That
doesn't seem right, only do this when in linewise mode.  But then do it
always, not only when start and end of Visual mode are equal.

When using "viw" on a single-letter word and 'selection' is exclusive, would
not include the word.

When formatting text from Insert mode, using CTRL-O, could mess up undo
information.

While writing a file (also for the backup file) there was no check for an
interrupt (hitting CTRL-C).  Vim could hang when writing a large file over a
slow network, and moving the mouse didn't make it appear (when 'mousehide' is
set) and the screen wasn't updated in the GUI.  Also allow interrupting when
syncing the swap file, it can take a long time.

When using ":mksession" while there is help window, it would later be restored
to the right file but not marked as a help buffer.  ":help" would then open
another window.  Now use the value "help" for 'buftype' to mark a help buffer.

The session file contained absolute path names in option values, that doesn't
work when the home directory depends on the situation.  Replace the home
directory with ~/ when possible.

When using 'showbreak' a TAB just after the shown break would not be counted
correctly, the cursor would be positioned wrong.

With 'showbreak' set to "--->" or "------->" and 'sts' set to 4, inserting
tabs did not work right.  Could cause a crash.  Backspacing was also wrong,
could get stuck at a line break.

Win32: crashed when tearing off a menu with over 300 items.

GUI: A menu or toolbar item would appear when only a tooltip was defined for
it.

When 'scrolloff' is non-zero and "$" is in 'cpoptions', using "s" while the
last line of the file is the first line on screen, the text wasn't displayed.

When running "autoconf", delete the configure cache to force starting cleanly
when configure is run again.

When changing the Normal colors for cterm, the value of 'background' was
changed even when the GUI was used.

The warning for a missing vimrun.exe was always given on startup, but some
people just editing a file don't need to be bothered by it.  Only show it when
vimrun would be used.

When using "%" in a multibyte text it could get confused by trailbytes that
match. (Muraoka Taro)

Termcap entry for RiscOS was wrong, using 7 and 8 in octal codes.

Athena: The title of a dialog window and the file selector window were not
set. (David Harrison)

The "htmlLink" highlight group specified colors, which gives problems when
using a color scheme.  Added the "Underlined" highlight group for this.

After using ":insert" or ":change" the '[ mark would be one line too low.

When looking for the file name after a match with 'include' one character was
skipped.  Same for 'define'.

Win32 and DJGPP: When editing a file with a short name in a directory, and
editing the same file but using the long name, would end up with two buffers
on the same file.

"gf" on a filename that starts with "../" only worked when the file being
edited is in the current directory.  An include file search didn't work
properly for files starting with "../" or ".".  Now search both relative to
the file and to the current directory.

When 'printheader', 'titlestring', 'iconstring', 'rulerformat' or 'statusline'
contained "%{" but no following "}" memory was corrupted and a crash could
happen.

":0append" and then inserting two lines did not redraw the blank lines that
were scrolled back down.

When using insert mode completion in a narrow window, the message caused a
scroll up.  Now shorten the message if it doesn't fit and avoid writing the
ruler over the message.

XIM still didn't work correctly on some systems, especially SGI/IRIX.  Added
the 'imdisable' option, which is set by default for that system.

Patch 6.0aw.008
Problem:    When the first character of a file name is over 127, the Buffers
	    menu entry would get a negative priority and cause problems.
Solution:   Reduce the multiplier for the first character when computing
	    the hash value for a Buffers menu entry.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0aw.010
Problem:    Win32: ":browse edit dir/dir" didn't work. (Vikas)

	    browser.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Athena file browser: On some systems wcstombs() can't be used to get the
length of a multi-byte string.  Use the maximum length then. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

Patch 6.0ax.001
Problem:    When 'patchmode' is set, appending to a file gives an empty
	    original file. (Ed Ralston)

Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.0ax.002

Solution:   Create the original file before decompressing.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/gzip.vim

Patch 6.0ax.005
Problem:    Athena file selector keeps the title of the first invocation.

	    Harrison)
Files:	    src/gui_at_fs.c

Patch 6.0ax.007
Problem:    When using GPM (mouse driver in a Linux console) a double click is
	    interpreted as a scroll wheel click.
Solution:   Check if GPM is being used when deciding if a mouse event is for
	    the scroll wheel.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 6.0ax.010
Problem:    The Edit.Save menu and the Save toolbar button didn't work when
	    the buffer has no file name.
Solution:   Use a file browser to ask for a file name.  Also fix the toolbar
	    Find item in Visual mode.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0ax.012
Problem:    When 'cpoptions' contains "$", breaking a line for 'textwidth'
	    doesn't redraw properly. (Stefan Schulze)
Solution:   Remove the dollar before breaking the line.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0ax.014
Problem:    Win32: On Windows 98 ":make -f file" doesn't work when 'shell' is
	    "command.com" and 'makeprg' is "nmake".  The environment isn't
	    passed on to "nmake".
Solution:   Also use vimrun.exe when redirecting the output of a command.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0ax.016
Problem:    The version number was reported wrong in the intro screen.
Solution:   Check for a version number with two additional letters.
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.0ax.019
Problem:    When scrolling a window with folds upwards, switching to another
	    vertically split window and back may not update the scrollbar.

Fixed							*fixed-6.1*
-----

The license text was updated to make the meaning clearer and make it
compatible with the GNU GPL.  Otherwise distributors have a problem when
linking Vim with a GPL'ed library.

When installing the "less.sh" script it was not made executable. (Chuck Berg)

Win32: The "9" key on the numpad wasn't working. (Julian Kinraid)

The NSIS install script didn't work with NSIS 1.80 or later.  Also add
Vim-specific icons. (Pruchnik)

The script for conversion to HTML contained an "if" in the wrong place.
(Michael Geddes)

Allow using ":ascii" in the sandbox, it's harmless.

Removed creat() from osdef2.h.in, it wasn't used and may cause a problem when
it's redefined to creat64().

The text files in the VisVim directory were in "dos" format.  This caused
problems when applying a patch.  Now keep them in "unix" format and convert
them to "dos" format only for the PC archives.

Add ruby files to the dos source archive, they can be used by Make_mvc.mak.
(Mirek Pruchnik)

"cp -f" doesn't work on all systems.  Change "cp -f" in the Makefile to "rm
-f" and "cp".

Didn't compile on a Compaq Tandem Himalaya OSS. (Michael A. Benzinger)

The GTK file selection dialog didn't include the "Create Dir", "Delete File"
and "Rename File" buttons.

When doing ":browse source" the dialog has the title "Run Macro".  Better
would be "Source Vim script". (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: Don't use the printer font as default for the font dialog.

"make doslang" didn't work when configure didn't run (yet).  Set $MAKEMO to
"yes". (Mirek Pruchnik)

The ToolBar TagJump item used "g]", which prompts for a selection even when
there is only one matching tag.  Use "g<C-]>" instead.

The ming makefile for message translations didn't have the right list of
files.

The MS-Windows 3.1 version complains about LIBINTL.DLL not found.  Compile
this version without message translations.

The Borland 5 makefile contained a check for Ruby which is no longer needed.
The URLs for the TCL library was outdated. (Dan Sharp)

The eviso.ps file was missing from the DOS runtime archive, it's needed for
printing PostScript in the 32bit DOS version.

In menu files ":scriptencoding" was used in a wrong way after patch 6.1a.032
Now use ":scriptencoding" in the file where the translations are given.  Do
the same for all menus in latin1 encoding.

Included a lot of fixes for the Macintosh, mostly to make it work with Carbon.
(Dany StAmant, Axel Kielhorn, Benji Fisher)

Improved the vimtutor shell script to use $TMPDIR when it exists, and delete
the copied file when exiting in an abnormal way. (Max Ischenko)

When "iconv.dll" can't be found, try using "libiconv.dll".

When encryption is used, filtering with a shell command wasn't possible.

DJGPP: ":cd c:" always failed, can't get permissions for "c:".
Win32: ":cd c:/" failed if the previous current directory on c: had become
invalid.

DJGPP: Shift-Del and Del both produce \316\123.  Default mapping for Del is
wrong.  Disabled it.

Dependencies on header files in MingW makefile was wrong.

Win32: Don't use ACL stuff for MSVC 4.2, it's not supported. (Walter Briscoe)

Win32 with Borland: bcc.cfg was caching the value for $(BOR), but providing a
different argument to make didn't regenerate it.

Win32 with MSVC: Make_ivc.mak generates a new if_ole.h in a different
directory, the if_ole.h in the src directory may be used instead.  Delete the
distributed file.

When a window is vertically split and then ":ball" is used, the window layout
is messed up, can cause a crash. (Muraoka Taro)

When 'insertmode' is set, using File/New menu and then double clicking, "i" is
soon inserted. (Merlin Hansen)

When Select mode is active and using the Buffers menu to switch to another
buffer, an old selection comes back.  Reset VIsual_reselect for a ":buffer"
command.

When Select mode is active and 'insertmode' is set, using the Buffers menu to
switch to another buffer, did not return to Insert mode.  Make sure
"restart_edit" is set.

When double clicking on the first character of a word while 'selection' is
"exclusive" didn't select that word.

Patch 6.0.006
Problem:    With a vertical split, 'number' set and 'scrolloff' non-zero,

	    Lindstrom)
Solution:   Check for a zero width.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.0.007
Problem:    When setting 'filetype' while there is no FileType autocommand, a

Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.0.037
Problem:    When the user has set "did_install_syntax_menu" to avoid the

Solution:   Don't add the three default items when "did_install_syntax_menu"
	    is set.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.038
Problem:    When 'selection' is "exclusive", deleting a block of text at the
	    end of a line can leave the cursor beyond the end of the line.
Solution:   Correct the cursor position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.039
Problem:    "gP" leaves the cursor in the wrong position when 'virtualedit' is
	    used.  Using "c" in blockwise Visual mode leaves the cursor in a
	    strange position.
Solution:   For "gP" reset the "coladd" field for the '] mark.  For "c" leave
	    the cursor on the last inserted character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.043
Problem:    Patch 6.0.041 was wrong.
Solution:   Use mch_getenv() instead of vim_getenv().
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.0.044
Problem:    Using a "containedin" list for a syntax item doesn't work for an
	    item that doesn't have a "contains" argument.  Also, "containedin"
	    doesn't ignore a transparent item. (Timo Frenay)
Solution:   When there is a "containedin" argument somewhere, always check for
	    contained items.  Don't check for the transparent item but the
	    item it's contained in.
Files:	    src/structs.h, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.045
Problem:    After creating a fold with a Visual selection, another window

Problem:    Using a regexp with "\(\)" inside a "\%[]" item causes a crash.
	    (Samuel Lacas)
Solution:   Don't allow nested atoms inside "\%[]".
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.048
Problem:    Win32: In the console the mouse doesn't always work correctly.
	    Sometimes after getting focus a mouse movement is interpreted like
	    a button click.
Solution:   Use a different function to obtain the number of mouse buttons.
	    Avoid recognizing a button press from undefined bits. (Vince Negri)
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0.049
Problem:    When using evim the intro screen is misleading. (Adrian Nagle)
Solution:   Mention whether 'insertmode' is set and the menus to be used.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/version.c

Patch 6.0.050
Problem:    UTF-8: "viw" doesn't include non-ASCII characters before the
	    cursor. (Bertilo Wennergren)

Problem:    When completing ":set tags=" a path with an embedded space causes
	    the completion to stop. (Sektor van Skijlen)
Solution:   Escape spaces with backslashes, like for ":set path=".  Also take
	    backslashes into account when searching for the start of the path
	    to complete (e.g., for 'backupdir' and 'cscopeprg').

Patch 6.0.135
Problem:    Menus that are not supposed to do anything used "<Nul>", which
	    still produced an error beep.
	    When CTRL-O is mapped for Insert mode, ":amenu" commands didn't
	    work in Insert mode.
	    Menu language falls back to English when $LANG ends in "@euro".
Solution:   Use "<Nop>" for a menu item that doesn't do anything, just like
	    mappings.
	    Use ":anoremenu" instead of ":amenu".
	    Ignore "@euro" in the locale name.
Files:	    runtime/makemenu.vim, runtime/menu.vim, src/menu.c

Patch 6.0.136
Problem:    When completing in Insert mode, a mapping could be unexpectedly
	    applied.

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.137
Problem:    GUI: When using the find or find/replace dialog from Insert mode,
	    the input mode is stopped.
Solution:   Don't use the input method status when the main window doesn't
	    have focus.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.0.138
Problem:    GUI: When using the find or find/replace dialog from Insert mode,
	    the text is inserted when CTRL-O is mapped. (Andre Pang)
	    When opening the dialog again, a whole word search isn't
	    recognized.
	    When doing "replace all" a whole word search was never done.
Solution:   Don't put a search or replace command in the input buffer,
	    execute it directly.
	    Recognize "\<" and "\>" after removing "\V".
	    Add "\<" and "\>" also for "replace all".
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.0.139
Problem:    When stopping 'wildmenu' completion, the statusline of the
	    bottom-left vertically split window isn't redrawn. (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)

	    when the buffer is wiped out.
Solution:   Clear the local mappings when deleting a buffer.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/getchar.c, src/proto/getchar.pro, src/vim.h

Patch 6.0.141
Problem:    When using ":enew" in an empty buffer, some buffer-local things
	    are not cleared.  b:keymap_name is not set.
Solution:   Clear user commands and mappings local to the buffer when re-using
	    the current buffer.  Reload the keymap.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.0.142
Problem:    When Python is linked statically, loading dynamic extensions might
	    fail.
Solution:   Add an extra linking flag when needed. (Andrew Rodionoff)
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/auto/configure

Patch 6.0.143

	    may not be updated properly when making a change.
Solution:   Add the "linebreaks" argument to ":syn sync".
Files:	    runtime/doc/syntax.txt, src/screen.c, src/structs.h, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.144
Problem:    After patch 6.0.088 redoing "veU" doesn't work.
Solution:   Don't add the "U" to the redo buffer, it will be used as an undo
	    command.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.145
Problem:    When Vim can't read any input it might get stuck.  When
	    redirecting stdin and stderr Vim would not read commands from a
	    file.  (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   When repeatedly trying to read a character when it's not possible,
	    exit Vim.  When stdin and stderr are not a tty, still try reading
	    from them, but don't do a blocking wait.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.0.146
Problem:    When 'statusline' contains "%{'-'}" this results in a zero.
	    (Milan Vancura)
Solution:   Don't handle numbers with a minus as a number, they were not
	    displayed anyway.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.0.147
Problem:    It's not easy to mark a Vim version as being modified.  The new
	    license requires this.
Solution:   Add the --modified-by argument to configure and the MODIFIED_BY
	    define.  It's used in the intro screen and the ":version" output.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in,
	    src/feature.h, src/version.c

Patch 6.0.148
Problem:    After "p" in an empty line, `[ goes to the second character.
	    (Kontra Gergely)
Solution:   Don't increment the column number in an empty line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.149
Problem:    The pattern "\(.\{-}\)*" causes a hang.  When using a search
	    pattern that causes a stack overflow to be detected Vim could
	    still hang.
Solution:   Correctly report "operand could be empty" when using "\{-}".
	    Check for "out_of_stack" inside loops to avoid a hang.
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.150
Problem:    When using a multi-byte encoding, patch 6.0.148 causes "p" to work
	    like "P". (Sung-Hyun Nam)
Solution:   Compute the byte length of a multi-byte character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.151
Problem:    Redrawing the status line and ruler can be wrong when it contains
	    multi-byte characters.
Solution:   Use character width and byte length correctly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.152
Problem:    strtrans() could hang on an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence.
Solution:   Skip over illegal bytes. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/charset.c

Patch 6.0.153
Problem:    When using (illegal) double-byte characters and Vim syntax
	    highlighting Vim can crash. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Increase a pointer over a character instead of a byte.
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.154
Problem:    MS-DOS and MS-Windows: The menu entries for xxd don't work when
	    there is no xxd in the path.
	    When converting back from Hex the filetype may remain "xxd" if it
	    is not detected.
Solution:   When xxd is not in the path use the one in the runtime directory,
	    where the install program has put it.
	    Clear the 'filetype' option before detecting the new value.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.155

Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.0.156
Problem:    Starting Vim with the -b argument and two files, ":next" doesn't
	    set 'binary' in the second file, like Vim 5.7. (Norman Diamond)
Solution:   Set the global value for 'binary'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.0.157
Problem:    When defining a user command with "-complete=dir" files will also
	    be expanded.  Also, "-complete=mapping" doesn't appear to work.
	    (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Use the expansion flags defined with the user command.
	    Handle expanding mappings specifically.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.0.158
Problem:    When getting the warning for a file being changed outside of Vim
	    and reloading the file, the 'readonly' option is reset, even when
	    the permissions didn't change. (Marcel Svitalsky)
Solution:   Keep 'readonly' set when reloading a file and the permissions
	    didn't change.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.0.159
Problem:    Wildcard expansion for ":emenu" also shows separators.
Solution:   Skip menu separators for ":emenu", ":popup" and ":tearoff".
	    Also, don't handle ":tmenu" as if it was ":tearoff".  And leave
	    out the alternatives with "&" included.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.0.160
Problem:    When compiling with GCC 3.0.2 and using the "-O2" argument, the
	    optimizer causes a problem that makes Vim crash.
Solution:   Add a configure check to avoid "-O2" for this version of gcc.

Patch 6.0.162
Problem:    Client-server: An error message for a wrong expression appears in
	    the server instead of the client.
Solution:   Pass the error message from the server to the client.  Also
	    adjust the example code. (Flemming Madsen)
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/main.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/proto/if_xcmdsrv.pro, src/proto/os_mswin.pro,
	    runtime/doc/eval.txt, runtime/tools/xcmdsrv_client.c

Patch 6.0.163
Problem:    When using a GUI dialog, a file name is sometimes used like it was
	    a directory.
Solution:   Separate path and file name properly.
	    For GTK, Motif and Athena concatenate directory and file name for
	    the default selection.

	    Insert and Visual mode. (Muraoka Taro)
Solution:   Add <script> to allow script-local mappings.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.165
Problem:    Using --remote and executing locally gives unavoidable error
	    messages.
Solution:   Add --remote-silent and --remote-wait-silent to silently execute
	    locally.
	    For Win32 there was no error message when a server didn't exist.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/main.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/proto/if_xcmdsrv.pro, src/proto/os_mswin.pro

Patch 6.0.166
Problem:    GUI: There is no way to avoid dialogs to pop up.
Solution:   Add the 'c' flag to 'guioptions': Use console dialogs.  (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.h, src/message.c

Patch 6.0.167
Problem:    When 'fileencodings' is "latin2" some characters in the help files

Patch 6.0.171
Problem:    With 'keymodel' including "startsel", in Insert mode after the end
	    of a line, shift-Left does not move the cursor. (Steve Hall)
Solution:   CTRL-O doesn't move the cursor left, need to do that explicitly.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.172
Problem:    CTRL-Q doesn't replace CTRL-V after CTRL-X in Insert mode while it
	    does in most other situations.
Solution:   Make CTRL-X CTRL-Q work like CTRL-X CTRL-V in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.173
Problem:    When using "P" to insert a line break the cursor remains past the
	    end of the line.
Solution:   Check for the cursor being beyond the end of the line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

	    command. (Sylvain Hitier)
Solution:   Redisplay the size of the selection after showing the mode.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.190
Problem:    GUI: when 'mouse' is empty a click with the middle button still

Solution:   Paste at the cursor position instead of the mouse position.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.191
Problem:    When no servers are available serverlist() gives an error instead
	    of returning an empty string. (Hari Krishna)
Solution:   Don't give an error message.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Solution:   Properly check for the argument.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.0.195
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and a search starts in virtual space
	    ":call search('x')" goes to the wrong position. (Eric Long)
Solution:   Reset coladd when finding a match.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.0.196
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set, 'selection' is "exclusive" and visually
	    selecting part of a tab at the start of a line, "x" joins it with
	    the previous line.  Also, when the selection spans more than one
	    line the whole tab is deleted.
Solution:   Take coladd into account when adjusting for 'selection' being
	    "exclusive".  Also expand a tab into spaces when deleting more
	    than one line.
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.197
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'selection' is "exclusive", "v$x"

Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.198
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'showbreak' is not empty, moving the
	    cursor over the line break doesn't work properly. (Eric Long)

Solution:   Ignore a missing path in a script header.  Also, speed up
	    recognizing scripts by simplifying the patterns used.
Files:	    runtime/scripts.vim

Patch 6.0.201

Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.0.206
Problem:    Unix: if expanding a wildcard in a file name results in a
	    wildcard character and there are more parts in the path with a
	    wildcard, it is expanded again.
	    Windows: ":edit \[abc]" could never edit the file "[abc]".
Solution:   Don't expand wildcards in already expanded parts.
	    Don't remove backslashes used to escape the special meaning of a
	    wildcard; can edit "[abc]" if '[' is removed from 'isfname'.

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.209
Problem:    GUI GTK: After selecting a 'guifont' with the font dialog there
	    are redraw problems for multi-byte characters.
Solution:   Separate the font dialog from setting the new font name to avoid
	    that "*" is used to find wide and bold fonts.
	    When redrawing extra characters for the bold trick, take care of
	    UTF-8 characters.

Solution:   Go to end of the fold before counting context lines.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.1b.029
Problem:    Win32: When a directory on an NTFS partition is read/execute (no
	    delete,modify,write) and the file has modify rights, trying to
	    write the file deletes it.  Making the file read/write/execute
	    (not delete) solves it. (Mark Canup)
Solution:   Use the Unix code to check for a writable directory.  If not, then
	    make a backup copy and overwrite the file.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.1b.030 (extra)

Patch 6.1b.033
Problem:    When using a count after a ":s" command may get ml_get errors.
	    (Dietmar Lang)
Solution:   Check that the resulting range does not go past the end of the
	    buffer.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.1b.034
Problem:    After sourcing mswin.vim, when using <C-S-Right> after

==============================================================================
VERSION 6.2						*version-6.2*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.1 and 6.2.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.

Main new features:
- Support for GTK 2. (Daniel Elstner)
- Support for editing Arabic text. (Nadim Shaikli & Isam Bayazidi)
- ":try" command and exception handling. (Servatius Brandt)
- Support for the neXtaw GUI toolkit (mostly like Athena). (Alexey Froloff)
- Cscope support for Win32. (Khorev Sergey)
- Support for PostScript printing in various 8-bit encodings. (Mike Williams)


Changed							*changed-6.2*
-------

Removed the scheme indent file, the internal Lisp indenting works well now.

Moved the GvimEXt, OleVim and VisVim directories into the "src" directory.
This is more consistent with how xxd is handled.

The VisVim.dll file is installed in the top directory, next to gvimext.dll,
instead of in a subdirectory "VisVim".  Fixes that NSIS was uninstalling it
from the wrong directory.

Removed the art indent file, it didn't do anything.

submatch() returned line breaks with CR instead of LF.

Changed the Win32 Makefiles to become more uniform and compile gvimext.dll.
(Dan Sharp)

'cindent': Align a "//" comment with a "//" comment in a previous line.
(Helmut Stiegler)

Previously only for xterm-like terminals parent widgets were followed to find
the title and icon label.  Now do this for all terminal emulators.

Made it possible to recognize backslashes for "%" matching.  The 'M' flag in
'cpoptions' disables it. (Haakon Riiser)

Removed the Make_tcc.mak makefile for Turbo C.  It didn't work and we probably
can't make it work (the compiler runs out of memory).

Even though the documentation refers to keywords, "[ CTRL-D" was using
'isident' to find matches.  Changed it to use 'iskeyword'.  Also applies to
other commands that search for defined words in included files such as
":dsearch", "[D" and "[d".

Made 'keywordprg' global-local. (Christian Robinson)

Enabled the Netbeans interface by default.  Reversed the configure argument
from "--enable-netbeans" to "--disable-netbeans".

(Servatius Brandt)
Moved part of ex_docmd.c to the new ex_eval.c source file.

Include support for GTK+ 2.2.x (Daniel Elstner)
Adds the "~" register: drag & drop text.
Adds the 'toolbariconsize' option.

Mac OSX: multi-language support: iconv and gettext. (Muraoka Taro, Axel
Kielhorn)

"\Z" flag in patterns: ignore differences in combining characters. (Ron Aaron)

Added 'preserveindent' and 'copyindent' options.  They use existing white
space characters instead of using Tabs as much as possible. (Chris Leishman)

Updated Unicode tables to Unicode 4.0. (Raphael Finkel)

Support for the mouse wheel in rxvt. (AIDA Shinra)

Win32: Added ":8" file modifier to get short filename.  Test50 tests the ":8"

The Vim icons in PNG format didn't have a transparent background. (Greg
Roelofs)

Fixed a large number of spelling mistakes in the docs. (Adri Verhoef)

The #defines for prototype generation were causing trouble.  Changed them to
typedefs.

A new version of libintl.h uses __asm__, which confuses cproto.  Define a
dummy __asm__ macro.

When 'virtualedit' is set can't move to halfway an unprintable character.
Cripples CTRL-V selection. (Taro Muraoka)
Allow moving to halfway an unprintable character.  Don't let getvvcol() change
the pos->coladd argument.

non-zero, only one character of the foldcolumn is highlighted. (Muraoka Taro)

When using ":catch" without an argument Vim crashes. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
When no argument given use the ".*" pattern.

Win32: When gvim.exe is started from a shortcut with the window style property
set to maximize Vim doesn't start with a maximized window. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)  Open the window with the default size and don't call ShowWindow()
again when it's already visible. (Helmut Stiegler)

gui_gtk.c used MAX, but it's undefined to avoid a conflict with system header
files.

Win32: When closing a window from a mapping some pixels remain on the
statusline. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

A column number in an errorformat that goes beyond the end of the line may
cause a crash.

":throw 'test'" crashes Vim. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

The file selector's scrollbar colors are not set after doing a ":hi Scrollbar
guifg=color".  And the file selector's colors are not changed by the
colorscheme command.  (David Harrison)

Motif: When compiling with FEAT_FOOTER defined, the text area gets a few
pixels extra space on the right.  Remove the special case in
gui_get_base_width(). (David Harrison)

In ":hardcopy > %.ps" the "%" was not expanded to the current filename.

Made ":redraw" also update the Visual area.

When a not implemented command, such as ":perl", has wrong arguments the less
important error was reported, giving the user the idea the command could work.

negative. (Vince Negri)

putenv() didn't work for MingW and Cygwin. (Dan Sharp)

XMapRaised() instead of XRaiseWindow(). (Srikanth Sankaran)

When using ":ptag" in a window where 'scrollbind' is set the preview window
would also have 'scrollbind' set.  Also reset 'foldcolumn' and 'diff'.

Various commands that split a window took over 'scrollbind', which is hardly
ever desired.  Esp. for "q:" and ":copen".  Mostly reset 'scrollbind' when
splitting a window.

When 'shellslash' is set in the vimrc file the first entry of ":scriptnames"
would still have backslashes.  Entries in the quickfix list could also have
wrong (back)slashes.

(Yasuhiro Matsumoto).

Win32: When 'encoding' is not the current codepage the title could not be set
to non-ascii characters.

"vim -d scp://machine/file1 scp://machine/file2" did not work, there was only
one window.  Fixed the netrw plugin not to wipe out the buffer if it is
displayed in other windows.

"/$" caused "e" in last column of screen to disappear, a highlighted blank was
displayed instead.

":s/ *\ze\n//e" removed the line break and introduced arbitrary text.  Was
using the line count including what matched after the "\ze".

Using the "c" flag with ":s" changed the behavior when a line break is
replaced and "\@<=" is used.  Without "c" a following match was not found.

":%s/\vA@<=\nB@=//gce" got stuck on "A\nB" when entering "n".

VMS: add HAVE_STRFTIME in the config file. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When a delete prompts if a delete should continue when yanking is not

library version of fgets() to work correctly for Metrowerks 2.2. (Axel
Kielhorn)

When typing a password a "*" was shown for each byte instead of for each
character.  Added multi-byte handling to displaying the stars. (Yasuhiro

different code for 5.6 and 5.8.  (Dan Sharp)

MingW and Cygwin: Don't strip the debug executable. (Dan Sharp)

Patch 6.1.102
Problem:    Unprintable and multi-byte characters in a statusline item are not

	    in an unmodified file.
Solution:   For this specific error use "ILLEGAL BYTE" and don't set
	    'readonly'.

Patch 6.1.225
Problem:    Using <C-O><C-^> in Insert mode has a delay when starting "vim -u
	    NONE" and ":set nocp hidden". (Emmanuel)  do_ecmd() uses
	    fileinfo(), the redraw is done after a delay to give the user time
	    to read the message.
Solution:   Put the message from fileio() in "keep_msg", so that the redraw is
	    done before the delay (still needed to avoid the mode message
	    overwrites the fileinfo() message).
Files:	    src/buffer.c

==============================================================================
VERSION 6.3						*version-6.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.2 and 6.3.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.
The major number of new items is in the runtime files and translations.


Changed							*changed-6.3*
-------

The intro message also displays a note about sponsoring Vim, mixed randomly
with the message about helping children in Uganda.

Included the translated menus, keymaps and tutors with the normal runtime
files.  The separate "lang" archive now only contains translated messages.

Made the translated menu file names a bit more consistent.  Use "latin1" for
"iso_8859-1" and "iso_8859-15".

Removed the "file_select.vim" script from the distribution.  It's not more
useful than other scripts that can be downloaded from www.vim.org.

The "runtime/doc/tags" file is now always in unix fileformat.  On MS-Windows
it used to be dos fileformat, but ":helptags" generates a unix format file.


Added							*added-6.3*

	:cNfile		go to last error in previous file
	:cpfile		idem

	    When the system is slow, unpacking the resource file takes too
	    long.
Solution:   Don't always define FEAT_GUI_MAC when MACOS is defined, define it
	    in the Makefile.
	    Add a configure option to skip Darwin detection.
	    Use a Python script to unpack the resources to avoid a race
	    condition. (Taro Muraoka)

Patch 6.2.149
Problem:    When the cursor is on a line past 21,474,748 the indicated
	    percentage of the position is invalid.  With that many lines
	    "100%" causes a negative cursor line number, resulting in a crash.
	    (Daniel Goujot)

	    that Insert mode isn't started too early.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.152
Problem:    The cursor() function doesn't reset the column offset for
	    'virtualedit'.
Solution:   Reset the offset to zero. (Helmut Stiegler)
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.153
Problem:    Win32: ":lang german" doesn't use German messages.

	    Koutsoloukas)
Files:	    src/quickfix.c

Patch 6.2.158

Patch 6.2.159
Problem:    When using expression folding and 'foldopen' is "undo" an undo
	    command doesn't always open the fold.
Solution:   Save and restore the KeyTyped variable when evaluating 'foldexpr'.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.160
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is "all" and 'selection' is "exclusive",
	    selecting a double-width character below a single-width character
	    may cause a crash.
Solution:   Avoid overflow on unsigned integer decrement. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.161 (extra)
Problem:    VMS: Missing header file.  Reading input busy loops.

Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.164 (after 6.2.144)
Problem:    When "g:html_use_css" is set the HTML header generated by the
	    2html script is still wrong.
Solution:   Search for a string instead of jumping to a fixed line number.
	    Go to the start of the line before inserting the header.
	    (Jess Thrysoee)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.165
Problem:    The configure checks hang when using autoconf 2.57.
Solution:   Invoke AC_PROGRAM_EGREP to set $EGREP. (Aron Griffis)
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.166
Problem:    When $GZIP contains "-N" editing compressed files doesn't work

Patch 6.2.170
Problem:    When using Sun WorkShop the current directory isn't changed to
	    where the file is.
Solution:   Set the 'autochdir' option when using WorkShop.  And avoid using
	    the basename when 'autochdir' is not set.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c, src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.171 (after 6.2.163)
Problem:    The "-or" argument of "find" doesn't work for SysV systems.
Solution:   Use "-o" instead. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.172 (after 6.2.169)

Patch 6.2.185
Problem:    Restoring a session with zero-height windows does not work
	    properly. (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Accept a zero argument to ":resize" as intended.  Add a window
	    number argument to ":resize" to be able to set the size of other

Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.190
Problem:    When editing a compressed files, marks are lost.
Solution:   Add the ":lockmarks" modifier and use it in the gzip plugin.
	    Make exists() also check for command modifiers, so that the
	    existence of ":lockmarks" can be checked for.
	    Also add ":keepmarks" to avoid that marks are deleted when
	    filtering text.
	    When deleting lines put marks 'A - 'Z and '0 - '9 at the first
	    deleted line instead of clearing the mark.  They were kept in the
	    viminfo file anyway.
	    Avoid that the gzip plugin puts deleted text in registers.

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.193
Problem:    When recalling a search pattern from the history from a ":s,a/c,"
	    command the '/' ends the search string. (JC van Winkel)
Solution:   Store the separator character with the history entries.  Escape
	    characters when needed, replace the old separator with the new one.
	    Also fixes that recalling a "/" search for a "?" command messes up
	    trailing flags.

	    "buttonRelease" event to the netbeans protocol.  Updated the
	    interface to version 2.2.  (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also: open a fold when the cursor has been positioned.
	    Also: fix memory leak, free result of nb_quote().

Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.199 (after 6.2.194)
Problem:    Vim doesn't work perfectly well with NetBeans.
Solution:   When NetBeans saves the file, reset the timestamp to avoid "file
	    changed" warnings.  Close a buffer in a proper way.  Don't try
	    giving a debug message with an invalid pointer.  Send a
	    newDotAndMark message when needed.  Report a change by the "r"
	    command to NetBeans.  (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.200
Problem:    When recovering a file, 'fileformat' is always the default, thus
	    writing the file may result in differences. (Penelope Fudd)
Solution:   Before recovering the file try reading the original file to obtain
	    the values of 'fileformat', 'fileencoding', etc.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.201
Problem:    When 'autowriteall' is set ":qall" still refuses to exit if there
	    is a modified buffer. (Antoine Mechelynck)
Solution:   Attempt writing modified buffers as intended.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.202
Problem:    Filetype names of CHILL and ch script are confusing.

Files:	    runtime/filetype.vim, runtime/makemenu.vim, runtime/synmenu.vim
	    runtime/syntax/ch.vim, runtime/syntax/chill.vim

Patch 6.2.203
Problem:    With characterwise text that has more than one line, "3P" works
	    wrong.  "3p" has the same problem.  There also is a display
	    problem. (Daniel Goujot)
Solution:   Perform characterwise puts with a count in the right position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.204 (after 6.2.086)
Problem:    "]]" in a file with closed folds moves to the end of the file.

Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.205 (extra)
Problem:    MS-Windows: When the taskbar is at the left or top of the screen,
	    the Vim window placement is wrong.
Solution:   Compute the size and position of the window correctly. (Taro
	    Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.206
Problem:    Multi-byte characters cannot be used as hotkeys in a console
	    dialog.  (Mattias Erkisson)
Solution:   Handle multi-byte characters properly.  Also put () or [] around
	    default hotkeys.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/macros.h

Patch 6.2.207
Problem:    When 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding, expanding an
	    abbreviation that starts where insertion started results in
	    characters before the insertion to be deleted.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Stop searching leftwards for the start of the word at the position
	    where insertion started.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.208
Problem:    When using fold markers, three lines in a row have the start
	    marker and deleting the first one with "dd", a nested fold is not
	    deleted.  (Kamil Burzynski)
	    Using marker folding, a level 1 fold doesn't stop when it is
	    followed by "{{{2", starting a level 2 fold.
Solution:   Don't stop updating folds at the end of a change when the nesting
	    level of folds is larger than the fold level.
	    Correctly compute the number of folds that start at "{{{2".
	    Also avoid a crash for a NULL pointer.
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.209
Problem:    A bogus fold is created when using "P" while the cursor is in the
	    middle of a closed fold. (Kamil Burzynski)
Solution:   Correct the line number where marks are modified for closed folds.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.210 (extra)
Problem:    Mac OSX: antialiased fonts are not supported.

Patch 6.2.211 (extra)
Problem:    Code for handling file dropped on Vim is duplicated.
Solution:   Move the common code to gui_handle_drop().
	    Add code to drop the files in the window under the cursor.
	    Support drag&drop on the Macintosh.  (Taro Muraoka)
	    When dropping a directory name edit that directory (using the
	    explorer plugin)
	    Fix that changing directory with Shift pressed didn't work for
	    relative path names.

Patch 6.2.219
Problem:    Syntax highlighting hangs on an empty match of an item with a
	    nextgroup.  (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Remember that the item has already matched and don't match it
	    again at the same position.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.220
Problem:    When a Vim server runs in a console a remote command isn't handled
	    before a key is typed.  (Joshua Neuheisel)
Solution:   Don't try reading more input when a client-server command has been
	    received.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.221
Problem:    No file name completion for ":cscope add".
Solution:   Add the XFILE flag to ":cscope". (Gary Johnson)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h

Patch 6.2.222
Problem:    Using "--remote" several times on a row only opens some of the
	    files. (Dany St-Amant)
Solution:   Don't delete all typeahead when the server receives a command from
	    a client, only delete typed characters.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.223
Problem:    Cscope: Avoid a hang when cscope waits for a response while Vim
	    waits for a prompt.
	    Error messages from Cscope mess up the display.
Solution:   Detect the hit-enter message and respond by sending a return
	    character to cscope. (Gary Johnson)
	    Use EMSG() and strerror() when possible.  Replace perror() with
	    PERROR() everywhere, add emsg3().
Files:	    src/diff.c, src/if_cscope.c, src/integration.c, src/message.c,
	    src/proto/message.pro, src/misc2.c, src/netbeans.c, src/vim.h

Problem:    NetBeans: Reported modified state isn't exactly right.
Solution:   Report a file being modified in the NetBeans way.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.226 (after 6.2.107) (extra)
Problem:    The "ws2-32.lib" file isn't always available.
Solution:   Use "WSock32.lib" instead. (Taro Muraoka, Dan Sharp)
Files:	    src/Make_cyg.mak, src/Make_ming.mak, src/Make_mvc.mak

Patch 6.2.227 (extra)
Problem:    The "PC" symbol is defined but not used anywhere.
Solution:   Remove "-DPC" from the makefiles.
Files:	    src/Make_bc3.mak, src/Make_bc5.mak, src/Make_cyg.mak,
	    src/Make_ming.mak

Patch 6.2.228
Problem:    Receiving CTRL-\ CTRL-N after typing "f" or "m" doesn't switch Vim
	    back to Normal mode.  Same for CTRL-\ CTRL-G.
Solution:   Check if the character typed after a command is CTRL-\ and obtain
	    another character to check for CTRL-N or CTRL-G, waiting up to
	    'ttimeoutlen' msec.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.229
Problem:    ":function" with a name that uses magic curlies does not work
	    inside a function.  (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Skip over the function name properly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.230 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: a complex pattern may cause a crash.
Solution:   Use __try and __except to catch the exception and handle it
	    gracefully, when possible.  Add myresetstkoflw() to reset the
	    stack overflow. (Benjamin Peterson)
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/os_mswin.c src/os_win32.c, src/os_win32.h,
	    src/proto/os_win32.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.231 (after 6.2.046)
Problem:    Various problems when an error exception is raised from within a
	    builtin function.  When it is invoked while evaluating arguments
	    to a function following arguments are still evaluated.  When
	    invoked with a line range it will be called for remaining lines.
Solution:   Update "force_abort" also after calling a builtin function, so
	    that aborting() always returns the correct value. (Servatius
	    Brandt)
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_eval.c, src/proto/ex_eval.pro,
	    src/testdir/test49.ok, src/testdir/test49.vim

Patch 6.2.232
Problem:    ":python vim.command('python print 2*2')" crashes Vim.  (Eugene
	    Minkovskii)
Solution:   Disallow executing a Python command recursively and give an error
	    message.
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.2.233
Problem:    On Mac OSX adding -pthread for Python only generates a warning.
	    The test for Perl threads rejects Perl while it's OK.
	    Tcl doesn't work at all.
	    The test for Ruby fails if ruby exists but there are no header
	    files.  The Ruby library isn't detected properly
Solution:   Avoid adding -pthread on Mac OSX.  Accept Perl threads when it's
	    not the 5.5 threads.
	    Use the Tcl framework for header files.  For Ruby rename cWindow
	    to cVimWindow to avoid a name clash. (Ken Scott)
	    Only enable Ruby when the header files can be found.  Use "-lruby"
	    instead of "libruby.a" when it can't be found.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.234
Problem:    GTK 2 GUI: ":sp" and the ":q" leaves the cursor on the command
	    line.
Solution:   Flush output before removing scrollbars.  Also do this in other
	    places where gui_mch_*() functions are invoked.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/option.c, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.235 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Cursor isn't removed with a 25x80 window and doing:
	    "1830ia<Esc>400a-<Esc>0w0". (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Remove the call to gui_undraw_cursor() from gui_mch_insert_lines().
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.236
Problem:    Using gvim with Agide gives "connection lost" error messages.
Solution:   Only give the "connection lost" message when the buffer was once
	    owned by NetBeans.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.237
Problem:    GTK 2: Thai text is drawn wrong.  It changes when moving the
	    cursor over it.
Solution:   Disable the shaping engine, it moves combining characters to a
	    wrong position and combines characters, while drawing the cursor
	    doesn't combine characters.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.238 (after 6.2.231)
Problem:    ":function" does not work inside a while loop. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Add get_while_line() and pass it to do_one_cmd() when in a while
	    loop, so that all lines are stored and can be used again when
	    repeating the loop.
	    Adjust test 49 so that it checks for the fixed problems.
	    (Servatius Brandt)

	    mouse pointer position.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.240
Problem:    GTK 2: Searching for bitmaps for the toolbar doesn't work as with
	    other systems.  Need to explicitly use "icon=name".  (Ned Konz,
	    Christian J.  Robinson)
Solution:   Search for icons like done for Motif.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.241
Problem:    GTK 2: Search and Search/Replace dialogs are synced, that makes no
	    sense.  Buttons are sometimes greyed-out. (Jeremy Messenger)
Solution:   Remove the code to sync the two dialogs.  Adjust the code to react
	    to an empty search string to also work for GTK2. (David Necas)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.242
Problem:    Gnome: "vim --help" only shows the Gnome arguments, not the Vim
	    arguments.
Solution:   Don't let the Gnome code remove the "--help" argument and don't
	    exit at the end of usage().
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/main.c

Patch 6.2.243 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: Dropping a file on a Vim icon causes a hit-enter prompt.
Solution:   Move the dropped files to the global argument list, instead of the
	    usual drop handling. (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/main.c, src/gui_mac.c

Patch 6.2.244
Problem:    ':echo "\xf7"' displays the illegal byte as if it was a character
	    and leaves "cho" after it.
Solution:   When checking the length of a UTF-8 byte sequence and it's shorter
	    than the number of bytes available, assume it's an illegal byte.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.245
Problem:    Completion doesn't work for ":keepmarks" and ":lockmarks".
Solution:   Add the command modifiers to the table of commands. (Madoka
	    Machitani)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.246
Problem:    Mac: Starting Vim from Finder doesn't show error messages.

	    "/dev/console".  (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/main.c, src/message.c

Patch 6.2.247 (after 6.2.193)
Problem:    When using a search pattern from the viminfo file the last
	    character is replaced with a '/'.

Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.248
Problem:    GTK: When XIM is enabled normal "2" and keypad "2" cannot be
	    distinguished.

Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.251
Problem:    GTK: The 'v' flag in 'guioptions' doesn't work. (Steve Hall)
	    Order of buttons is reversed for GTK 2.2.4.  Don't always get
	    focus back after handling a dialog.
Solution:   Make buttons appear vertically when desired.  Reverse the order in
	    which buttons are added to a dialog.  Move mouse pointer around
	    when the dialog is done and we don't have focus.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.252 (extra, after 6.2.243)

	    Mac OS classic.
Solution:   Remove the #ifdef from the code that fixes it for Mac OSX.
Files:	    src/gui_mac.c

Patch 6.2.253
Problem:    When 'tagstack' is not set a ":tag id" command does not work after

Solution:   Don't increment the menu item index.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.256
Problem:    Mac: "macroman" encoding isn't recognized, need to use
	    "8bit-macroman".
Solution:   Recognize "macroman" with an alias "mac". (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.257 (after 6.2.250)
Problem:    Signs are deleted for ":bdel", but they could still be useful.

Problem:    GUI: can't disable (grey-out) a popup menu item.  (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Loop over the popup menus for all modes.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.259
Problem:    If there are messages when exiting, on the console there is a
	    hit-enter prompt while the message can be read; in the GUI the
	    message may not be visible.
Solution:   Use the hit-enter prompt when there is an error message from
	    writing the viminfo file or autocommands, or when there is any
	    output in the GUI and 'verbose' is set.  Don't use a hit-enter
	    prompt for the non-GUI version unless there is an error message.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.260
Problem:    GTK 2: Can't quit a dialog with <Esc>.
	    GTK 1 and 2: <Enter> always gives a result, even when the default

	    use the first one (works mostly like it was before).
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.261
Problem:    When 'autoindent' and 'cindent' are set and a line is recognized
	    as a comment, starting a new line won't do 'cindent' formatting.
Solution:   Also use 'cindent' formatting for lines that are used as a
	    comment. (Servatius Brandt)
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.262
Problem:    1 CTRL-W w beeps, even though going to the first window is
	    possible. (Charles Campbell)

Patch 6.2.263
Problem:    Lint warnings: Duplicate function prototypes, duplicate macros,
	    use of a zero character instead of a zero pointer, unused
	    variable.  Clearing allocated memory in a complicated way.
Solution:   Remove the function prototypes from farsi.h.  Remove the
	    duplicated lines in keymap.h.  Change getvcol() argument from NUL
	    to NULL.  Remove the "col" variable in regmatch().  Use
	    lalloc_clear() instead of lalloc(). (Walter Briscoe)

	    can't be changed from a modeline.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/options.c

Patch 6.2.266
Problem:    When redirecting output and using ":silent", line breaks are
	    missing from output of ":map" and ":tselect".  Alignment of
	    columns is wrong.
Solution:   Insert a line break where "msg_didout" was tested.  Update msg_col
	    when redirecting and using ":silent".
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/message.c

Patch 6.2.267 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: "&&" in a tearoff menu is not shown. (Luc Hermitte)

	    a character that contains a change.
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.2.270
Problem:    Completion in Insert mode, then repeating with ".", doesn't handle
	    composing characters in the completed text. (Raphael Finkel)
Solution:   Don't skip over composing chars when adding completed text to the
	    redo buffer.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.271
Problem:    NetBeans: Can't do "tail -f" on the log.  Passing socket info with
	    an argument or environment variable is not secure.
Solution:   Wait after initializing the log.  Allow passing the socket info
	    through a file. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    runtime/doc/netbeans.txt, src/main.c, src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.272
Problem:    When the "po" directory exists, but "po/Makefile" doesn't,
	    building fails.  Make loops when the "po" directory has been
	    deleted after running configure.
Solution:   Check for the "po/Makefile" instead of just the "po" directory.
	    Check this again before trying to run make with that Makefile.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/Makefile

Solution:   Convert the text to 'encoding'.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.284
Problem:    Listing a function puts "endfunction" in the message history.
	    Typing "q" at the more prompt isn't handled correctly when listing
	    variables and functions.  (Hara Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't use msg() for "endfunction".  Check "got_int" regularly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Solution:   Restore "restart_edit" after an insert command that was not typed.
	    Avoid waiting with displaying the mode when there is no text to be

	    properly.
Solution:   Only make a new entry in the changelist when making a change in
	    another line or 'textwidth' columns away.  Add E662, E663 and E664
	    error messages.  Put a changelist mark from viminfo one position
	    before the end.

Solution:   Handle the pointer move event for the tear-off menu window.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.2.355 (after 6.2.303)
Problem:    When 'encoding' is a double-byte encoding different from the
	    current locale, the width of characters is not correct.
	    Possible failure and memory leak when using iconv, Unicode
	    digraphs and 'encoding' is not "utf-8".
Solution:   Use iconv() to discover the actual width of characters.
	    Add the "vc_fail" field to vimconv_T.
	    When converting a digraph, init the conversion type to NONE and
	    cleanup afterwards.
Files:	    src/digraph.c, src/mbyte.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.356
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' and 'selection' is
	    "exclusive", "vy" only yanks the first byte of a double-byte
	    character.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Correct the column in unadjust_for_sel() to position on the first
	    byte, always include the trailing byte of the selected text.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.357 (after 6.2.321)
Problem:    Memory leak when resizing the Vim window.
Solution:   Free the LineWraps array.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.358 (after 6.2.299)

Patch 6.2.360
Problem:    "100|" in an empty line results in a ruler "1,0-100". (Pavol
	    Juhas)
Solution:   Recompute w_virtcol if the target column was not reached.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.361 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Run gvim, ":set go-=m", use Alt-Tab, keep Alt pressed while
	    pressing Esc, then release Alt: Cursor disappears and typing a key
	    causes a beep. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't ignore the WM_SYSKEYUP event when the menu is disabled.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.2.362 (extra, after 6.2.347)
Problem:    Win32: The manifest causes Gvim not to work. (Dave Roberts)
Solution:   Change "x86" to "X86". (Serge Pirotte)
Files:	    src/gvim.exe.mnf

Patch 6.2.363
Problem:    In an empty file with 'showmode' off, "i" doesn't change the ruler
	    from "0-1" to "1".  Typing "x<BS>" does show "1", but then <Esc>
	    doesn't make it "0-1" again.  Same problem for ruler in
	    statusline.  (Andrew Pimlott)
Solution:   Remember the "empty line" flag with Insert mode and'ed to it.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.364
Problem:    HTML version of the documentation doesn't mention the encoding,
	    which is a problem for mbyte.txt.
Solution:   Adjust the awk script. (Ilya Sher)
Files:	    runtime/doc/makehtml.awk

Patch 6.2.365
Problem:    The configure checks for Perl and Python may add compile and link
	    arguments that break building Vim.
Solution:   Do a sanity check: try building with the arguments.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.366
Problem:    When the GUI can't start because no valid font is found, there is
	    no error message. (Ugen)
Solution:   Add an error message.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.367
Problem:    Building the help tags file while installing may fail if there is
	    another Vim in $PATH.
Solution:   Specify the just installed Vim executable. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.368
Problem:    When 'autochdir' is set, closing a window doesn't change to the
	    directory of the new current window. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Handle 'autochdir' always when a window becomes the current one.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.369
Problem:    Various memory leaks: when using globpath(), when searching for
	    help tags files, when defining a function inside a function, when
	    giving an error message through an exception, for the final "."
	    line in ":append", in expression "cond ? a : b" that fails and for
	    missing ")" in an expression.  Using NULL pointer when adding
	    first user command and for pointer computations with regexp.
	    (tests by Dominique Pelle)
Solution:   Fix the leaks by freeing the allocated memory.  Don't use the
	    array of user commands when there are no entries.  Use a macro
	    instead of a function call for saving and restoring regexp states.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/regexp.c, src/screen.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.370 (extra, after6.2.341)
Problem:    Win32: When the path to diff.exe contains a space and using the
	    vimrc generated by the install program, diff mode may not work.
	    (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)
Solution:   Do not use double quotes for arguments that do not have a space.
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.2.371
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and there is a Tab before the next "x",
	    "dtx" does not delete the whole Tab. (Ken Hashishi)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the last position of the Tab.  Also for
	    "df<Tab>".
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.372
Problem:    When using balloon evaluation, no value is displayed for members
	    of structures and items of an array.
Solution:   Include "->", "." and "[*]" in the expression.
Files:	    src/gui_beval.c, src/normal.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.373
Problem:    When 'winminheight' is zero and a window is reduced to zero
	    height, the ruler always says "Top" instead of the cursor
	    position. (Antoine J. Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't recompute w_topline for a zero-height window.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.374
Problem:    ":echo "hello" | silent normal n" removes the "hello" message.
	    (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Don't echo the search string when ":silent" was used.  Also don't
	    show the mode.  In general: don't clear to the end of the screen.
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/message.c, src/os_unix.c, src/proto/message.pro,
	    src/screen.c, src/search.c, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.375
Problem:    When changing 'guioptions' the hit-enter prompt may be below the
	    end of the Vim window.
Solution:   Call screen_alloc() before showing the prompt.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.376
Problem:    Win32: Ruby interface cannot be dynamically linked with Ruby 1.6.
Solution:   Add #ifdefs around use of rb_w32_snprintf().  (Benot Cerrina)
Files:	    src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.377 (after 6.2.372)
Problem:    Compiler warnings for signed/unsigned compare. (Michael Wookey)
Solution:   Add type cast.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.378 (extra, after 6.2.118)
Problem:    Mac: cannot build with Project Builder.
Solution:   Add remove_tail_with_ext() to locate and remove the "build"
	    directory from the runtime path.  Include os_unix.c when needed.
	    (Dany St Amant)
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/os_macosx.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.379
Problem:    Using ":mkvimrc" in the ":options" window sets 'bufhidden' to
	    "delete". (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Do not add buffer-specific option values to a global vimrc file.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.380 (extra)
Problem:    DOS: "make test" fails when running it again.  Can't "make test"
	    with Borland C.
Solution:   Make sure ".out" files are deleted when they get in the way.  Add
	    a "test" target to the Borland C Makefile.
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak

Patch 6.2.381
Problem:    Setting 'fileencoding' to a comma separated list (confusing it
	    with 'fileencodings') does not result in an error message.
	    Setting 'fileencoding' in an empty file marks it as modified.
	    There is no "+" in the title after setting 'fileencoding'.
Solution:   Check for a comma in 'fileencoding'.  Only consider a non-empty
	    file modified by changing 'fileencoding'.  Update the title after
	    changing 'fileencoding'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.382
Problem:    Running "make test" puts marks from test files in viminfo.
Solution:   Specify a different viminfo file to use.
Files:	    src/testdir/test15.in, src/testdir/test49.in

Patch 6.2.383

Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.384
Problem:    ":menu a.&b" ":unmenu a.b" only works if "&b" isn't translated.
Solution:   Also compare the names without '&' characters.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.385  (extra)
Problem:    Win32: forward_slash() and trash_input_buf() are undefined when
	    compiling with small features. (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Change the #ifdefs for forward_slash().  Don't call
	    trash_input_buf() if the input buffer isn't used.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.386
Problem:    Wasting time trying to read marks from the viminfo file for a
	    buffer without a name.
Solution:   Skip reading marks when the buffer has no name.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.387
Problem:    There is no highlighting of translated items in help files.
Solution:   Search for a "help_ab.vim" syntax file when the help file is
	    called "*.abx".  Also improve the help highlighting a bit.
Files:	    runtime/syntax/help.vim

Patch 6.2.388
Problem:    GTK: When displaying some double-width characters they are drawn
	    as single-width, because of conversion to UTF-8.
Solution:   Check the width that GTK uses and add a space if it's one instead
	    of two.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.389
Problem:    When working over a slow connection, it's very annoying that the
	    last line is partly drawn and then cleared for every change.
Solution:   Don't redraw the bottom line if no rows were inserted or deleted.
	    Don't draw the line if we know "@" lines will be used.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.390
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multi-byte characters only replaces
	    every other character. (Tyson Roberts)
Solution:   Correct the cursor position after replacing each character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.391 (extra)
Problem:    The ":highlight" command is not tested.
Solution:   Add a test script for ":highlight".
Files:	    src/testdir/Makefile, src/testdir/Make_amiga.mak,
	    src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/Make_os2.mak,

Problem:    Unused variable.
Solution:   Remove "dlen".
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.393
Problem:    When using very long lines the viminfo file can become very big.
Solution:   Add the "s" flag to 'viminfo': skip registers with more than the
	    specified Kbyte of text.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.394  (after 6.2.391)
Problem:    Test 51 fails on a terminal with 8 colors. (Tony Leneis)
Solution:   Use "DarkBlue" instead of "Blue" to avoid the "bold" attribute.
Files:	    src/testdir/test51.in

Patch 6.2.395
Problem:    When using ":tag" or ":pop" the previous matching tag is used.
	    But since the current file is different, the ordering of the tags
	    may change.
Solution:   Remember what the current buffer was for when re-using cur_match.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/tag.pro, src/structs.h,
	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.396
Problem:    When CTRL-T jumps to another file and an autocommand moves the
	    cursor to the '" mark, don't end up on the right line.  (Michal
	    Malecki)
Solution:   Set the line number after loading the file.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.397
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' mapping <M-x> doesn't work.
	    (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Do not set the 8th bit of the character but use a modifier.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/gui_x11.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.398 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 console: no extra key modifiers are supported.
Solution:   Encode the modifiers into the input stream.  Also fix that special
	    keys are converted and stop working when 'tenc' is set.  Also fix
	    that when 'tenc' is initialized the input and output conversion is
	    not setup properly until 'enc' or 'tenc' is set.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/option.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.399
Problem:    A ":set" command that fails still writes a message when it is

Solution:   Include header file poll.h. (Malte Neumann)
Files:	    src/if_xcmdsrv.c

Patch 6.2.401
Problem:    When opening a buffer that was previously opened, Vim does not
	    restore the cursor position if the first line starts with white
	    space.  (Gregory Margo)
Solution:   Don't skip restoring the cursor position if it is past the blanks
	    in the first line.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.402
Problem:    Mac: "make install" doesn't generate help tags. (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Generate help tags before copying the runtime files.
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.403
Problem:    ":@y" checks stdin if there are more commands to execute.  This
	    fails if stdin is not connected, e.g., when starting the GUI from
	    KDE. (Ned Konz)
Solution:   Only check for a next command if there still is typeahead.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.404
Problem:    Our own function to determine width of Unicode characters may get
	    outdated. (Markus Kuhn)
Solution:   Use wcwidth() when it is available.  Also use iswprint().
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in, src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.405
Problem:    Cannot map zero without breaking the count before a command.
	    (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Disable mapping zero when entering a count.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/globals.h, src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.406
Problem:    ":help \zs", ":help \@=" and similar don't find useful help.
Solution:   Prepend "/\" to the arguments to find the desired help tag.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.407 (after 6.2.299)
Problem:    ":help \@<=" doesn't find help.
Solution:   Avoid that ":help \@<=" searches for the "<=" language.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.408
Problem:    ":compiler" is not consistent: Sets local options and a global
	    variable. (Douglas Potts)  There is no error message when a
	    compiler is not supported.
Solution:   Use ":compiler!" to set a compiler globally, otherwise it's local
	    to the buffer and "b:current_compiler" is used.  Give an error
	    when no compiler script could be found.
	    Note: updated compiler plugins can be found at
	    ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/compiler/
Files:	    runtime/compiler/msvc.vim, runtime/doc/quickfix.txt, src/eval.c,
	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.409
Problem:    The cursor ends up in the last column instead of after the line
	    when doing "i//<Esc>o" with 'indentexpr' set to "cindent(v:lnum)".
	    (Toby Allsopp)
Solution:   Adjust the cursor as if in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.410 (after 6.2.389)
Problem:    In diff mode, when there are more filler lines than fit in the
	    window, they are not drawn.
Solution:   Check for filler lines when skipping to draw a line that doesn't
	    fit.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.411
Problem:    A "\n" inside a string is not seen as a line break by the regular
	    expression matching. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Add the vim_regexec_nl() function for strings where "\n" is to be
	    matched with a line break.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_eval.c, src/proto/regexp.c, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.412
Problem:    Ruby: "ruby << EOF" inside a function doesn't always work.  Also
	    for ":python", ":tcl" and ":perl".
Solution:   Check for "<< marker" and skip until "marker" before checking for
	    "endfunction".
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.413 (after 6.2.411)
Problem:    Missing prototype for vim_regexec_nl(). (Marcel Svitalsky)
Solution:   Now really include the prototype.
Files:	    src/proto/regexp.pro

Patch 6.2.414
Problem:    The function used for custom completion of user commands cannot
	    have <SID> to make it local. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Pass the SID of the script where the user command was defined on
	    to the completion.  Also clean up #ifdefs.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/eval.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.415
Problem:    Vim may crash after a sequence of events that change the window
	    size.  The window layout assumes a larger window than is actually
	    available. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Invoke win_new_shellsize() from screenalloc() instead of from
	    set_shellsize().
Files:	    src/screen.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.2.416
Problem:    Compiler warning for incompatible pointer.
Solution:   Remove the "&" in the call to poll(). (Xavier de Gaye)
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.417 (after 6.2.393)
Problem:    Many people forget that the '"' item in 'viminfo' needs to be
	    preceded with a backslash,
Solution:   Add '<' as an alias for the '"' item.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.418
Problem:    Using ":nnoremap <F12> :echo "cheese" and ":cabbr cheese xxx":
	    when pressing <F12> still uses the abbreviation. (Hari Krishna)
Solution:   Also apply "noremap" to abbreviations.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.419 (extra)

	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro

Patch 6.2.420
Problem:    Cannot specify a file to be edited in binary mode without setting
	    the global value of the 'binary' option.
Solution:   Support ":edit ++bin file".

Patch 6.2.421
Problem:    Cannot set the '[ and '] mark, which may be necessary when an
	    autocommand simulates reading a file.
Solution:   Allow using "m[" and "m]".
Files:	    runtime/doc/motion.txt, src/mark.c

Patch 6.2.422
Problem:    In CTRL-X completion messages the "/" makes them less readable.
Solution:   Remove the slashes. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.423
Problem:    ":vertical wincmd ]" does not split vertically.
Solution:   Add "postponed_split_flags".
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/globals.h, src/if_cscope.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.424
Problem:    A BufEnter autocommand that sets an option stops 'mousefocus' from
	    working in Insert mode (Normal mode is OK). (Gregory Seidman)
Solution:   In the Insert mode loop invoke gui_mouse_correct() when needed.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.425
Problem:    Vertical split and command line window: can only drag status line
	    above the cmdline window on the righthand side, not lefthand side.
Solution:   Check the status line row instead of the window pointer.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.426
Problem:    A syntax region end match with a matchgroup that includes a line
	    break only highlights the last line with matchgroup. (Gary
	    Holloway)
Solution:   Also use the line number of the position where the region
	    highlighting ends.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.427 (extra)
Problem:    When pasting a lot of text in a multi-byte encoding, conversion
	    from 'termencoding' to 'encoding' may fail for some characters.
	    (Kuang-che Wu)
Solution:   When there is an incomplete byte sequence at the end of the read
	    text keep it for the next time.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro,
	    src/proto/os_mswin.pro, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.428
Problem:    The X11 clipboard supports the Vim selection for char/line/block
	    mode, but since the encoding is not included  can't copy/paste
	    between two Vims with a different 'encoding'.
Solution:   Add a new selection format that includes the 'encoding'.  Perform
	    conversion when necessary.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/ui.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.429
Problem:    Unix: glob() doesn't work for a directory with a single quote in
	    the name. (Nazri Ramliy)
Solution:   When using the shell to expand, only put double quotes around
	    spaces and single quotes, not the whole thing.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.430
Problem:    BOM at start of a vim script file is not recognized and causes an
	    error message.
Solution:   Detect the BOM and skip over it.  Also fix that after using
	    ":scriptencoding" the iconv() file descriptor was not closed
	    (memory leak).
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.431
Problem:    When using the horizontal scrollbar, the scrolling is limited to
	    the length of the cursor line.
Solution:   Make the scroll limit depend on the longest visible line.  The
	    cursor is moved when necessary.  Including the 'h' flag in
	    'guioptions' disables this.
Files:	    runtime/doc/gui.txt, runtime/doc/options.txt, src/gui.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/option.h

Patch 6.2.432 (after 6.2.430 and 6.2.431)

	    result. (Alejandro Lopez Valencia)
Solution:   Use a string for each combination.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.434 (after 6.2.431)
Problem:    Compiler warning. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Add type casts.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.435
Problem:    When there are vertically split windows the minimal Vim window
	    height is computed wrong.
Solution:   Use frame_minheight() to correctly compute the minimal height.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.436
Problem:    Running the tests changes the user's viminfo file.
Solution:   In test 49 tell the extra Vim to use the test viminfo file.
Files:	    src/testdir/test49.vim

Patch 6.2.437
Problem:    ":mksession" always puts "set nocompatible" in the session file.
	    This changes option settings. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Add an "if" to only change 'compatible' when needed.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.438
Problem:    When the 'v' flag is present in 'cpoptions', backspacing and then
	    typing text again: one character too much is overtyped before
	    inserting is done again.
Solution:   Set "dollar_vcol" to the right column.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.439
Problem:    GTK 2: Changing 'lines' may cause a mismatch between the window
	    layout and the size of the window.
Solution:   Disable the hack with force_shell_resize_idle().
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.440
Problem:    When 'lazyredraw' is set the window title is still updated.
	    The size of the Visual area and the ruler are displayed too often.
Solution:   Postpone redrawing the window title.  Only show the Visual area
	    size when waiting for a character.  Don't draw the ruler
	    unnecessary.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/normal.c, src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.441
Problem:    ":unabbreviate foo " doesn't work, because of the trailing space,
	    while an abbreviation with a trailing space is not possible. (Paul
	    Jolly)
Solution:   Accept a match with the lhs of an abbreviation without the
	    trailing space.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.442
Problem:    Cannot manipulate the command line from a function.
Solution:   Add getcmdline(), getcmdpos() and setcmdpos() functions and the
	    CTRL-\ e command.
Files:	    runtime/doc/cmdline.txt, runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c
	    src/ex_getln.c, src/ops.c, src/proto/ex_getln.pro,
	    src/proto/ops.pro

Patch 6.2.443
Problem:    With ":silent! echoerr something" you don't get the position of
	    the error.  emsg() only writes the message itself and returns.
Solution:   Also redirect the position of the error.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.444
Problem:    When adding the 'c' flag to a ":substitute" command it may replace
	    more times than without the 'c' flag.  Happens for a  match that
	    starts with "\ze" (Marcel Svitalsk) and when using "\@<=" (Klaus
	    Bosau).
Solution:   Correct "prev_matchcol" when replacing the line.  Don't replace
	    the line when the pattern uses look-behind matching.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/regexp.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.445
Problem:    Copying vimtutor to /tmp/something is not secure, a symlink may

	    create the directory with mode 700.  (Stefan Nordhausen)
Files:	    src/vimtutor

Patch 6.2.446 (after 6.2.404)
Problem:    Using library functions wcwidth() and iswprint() results in
	    display problems for Hebrew characters. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Disable the code to use the library functions, use our own.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.447 (after 6.2.440)
Problem:    Now that the title is only updated when redrawing, it is no longer
	    possible to show it while executing a function. (Madoka Machitani)
Solution:   Make ":redraw" also update the title.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

	    option values for 'include' and 'defined'. (RG Kiran)
Solution:   Adjust the default values to allow white space before the #.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.451
Problem:    GTK: when using XIM there are various problems, including setting
	    'modified' and breaking undo at the wrong moment.
Solution:   Add "xim_changed_while_preediting", "preedit_end_col" and
	    im_is_preediting(). (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/globals.h, src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c,
	    src/mbyte.c, src/misc1.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c,
	    src/undo.c

Patch 6.2.452
Problem:    In diff mode, when DiffAdd and DiffText highlight settings are
	    equal, an added line is highlighted with DiffChange. (Tom Schumm)
Solution:   Remember the diff highlight type instead of the attributes.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.453
Problem:    ":s/foo\|\nbar/x/g" does not replace two times in "foo\nbar".
	    (Pavel Papushev)
Solution:   When the pattern can match a line break also try matching at the
	    NUL at the end of a line.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.454
Problem:    ":let b:changedtick" doesn't work. (Alan Schmitt)  ":let
	    b:changedtick = 99" does not give an error message.

Patch 6.2.456 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Editing a file by its Unicode name (dropping it on Vim or
	    using the file selection dialog) doesn't work. (Yakov Lerner, Alex
	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Use wide character functions when file names are involved and
	    convert from/to 'encoding' where needed.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/macros.h, src/memfile.c, src/memline.c,
	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.457 (after 6.2.244)
Problem:    When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and writing text with chars above 0x80
	    in latin1, conversion is wrong every 8200 bytes. (Oyvind Holm)
Solution:   Correct the utf_ptr2len_check_len() function and fix the problem
	    of displaying 0xf7 in utfc_ptr2len_check_len().
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.458
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set "$" doesn't move to the end of an
	    unprintable character, causing "y$" not to include that character.
	    (Fred Ma)
Solution:   Set "coladd" to move the cursor to the end of the character.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.459 (after 6.2.454)

Solution:   Reset "use_reg_one" at the right moment.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.462
Problem:    Finding a matching parenthesis does not correctly handle a
	    backslash in a trailing byte.
Solution:   Handle multi-byte characters correctly. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.463 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: An NTFS file system may contain files with extra info
	    streams.  The current method to copy them creates one and then
	    deletes it again.  (Peter Toennies)  Also, only three streams with
	    hard coded names are copied.
Solution:   Use BackupRead() to check which info streams the original file
	    contains and only copy these streams.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.464 (extra, after 6.2.427)
Problem:    Amiga: Compilation error with gcc. (Ali Akcaagac)

	    shell output when ignoring case.
Solution:   Skip 'O' and 'I' in tempname().
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.471
Problem:    "-L/usr/lib" is used in the link command, even though it's
	    supposed to be filtered out. "-lw" and "-ldl" are not
	    automatically added when needed for "-lXmu". (Antonio Colombo)
Solution:   Check for a space after the argument instead of before.  Also
	    remove "-R/usr/lib" if it's there.  Check for "-lw" and "-ldl"
	    before trying "-lXmu".
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/link.sh

Patch 6.2.472
Problem:    When using a FileChangedShell autocommand that changes the current
	    buffer, a buffer exists that can't be wiped out.
	    Also, Vim sometimes crashes when executing an external command
	    that changes the buffer and a FileChangedShell autocommand is
	    used.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Users are confused by the warning for a file being changed outside
	    of Vim.
Solution:   Avoid that the window counter for a buffer is incremented twice.
	    Avoid that buf_check_timestamp() is used recursively.
	    Add a hint to look in the help for more info.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.473
Problem:    Using CTRL-] in a help buffer without a name causes a crash.
Solution:   Check for name to be present before using it. (Taro Muraoka)

Problem:    When Vim is starting up conversion is done unnecessarily.  Failure
	    to find the runtime files on Windows 98. (Randall W. Morris)
Solution:   Init enc_codepage negative, only use it when not negative.
	    Don't use GetFileAttributesW() on Windows 98 or earlier.
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.475
Problem:    Commands after "perl <<EOF" are parsed as Vim commands when they

	    src/if_ruby.c, src/if_tcl.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.476
Problem:    When reloading a hidden buffer changed outside of Vim and the
	    current buffer is read-only, the reloaded buffer becomes
	    read-only.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Save the 'readonly' flag of the reloaded buffer instead of the
	    current buffer.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.477
Problem:    Using remote_send(v:servername, "\<C-V>") causes Vim to hang.
	    (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   When the resulting string is empty don't set received_from_client.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.478
Problem:    Win32: "--remote file" fails changing directory if the current
	    directory name starts with a single quote.  (Iestyn Walters)
Solution:   Add a backslash where it will be removed later.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/misc2.c, src/proto/misc2.pro

Patch 6.2.479
Problem:    The error message for errors during recovery goes unnoticed.
Solution:   Avoid that the hit-enter prompt overwrites the message.  Add a few
	    lines to make the error stand out.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/message.c, src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.480
Problem:    NetBeans: Using negative index in array.  backslash at end of
	    message may cause Vim to crash. (Xavier de Gaye)
Solution:   Initialize buf_list_used to zero. Check for trailing backslash.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.481
Problem:    When writing a file it is not possible to specify that hard and/or
	    symlinks are to be broken instead of preserved.
Solution:   Add the "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values to 'backupcopy'.
	    (Simon Ekstrand)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/fileio.c, src/option.c, src/option.h

Patch 6.2.482
Problem:    Repeating insert of CTRL-K 1 S doesn't work.  The superscript 1 is
	    considered to be a digit. (Juergen Kraemer)
Solution:   In vim_isdigit() only accept '0' to '9'.  Use VIM_ISDIGIT() for
	    speed where possible.  Also add vim_isxdigit().

Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/config.h.in, src/configure.in,
	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.497 (extra)

Patch 6.2.506 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When 'encoding' is a codepage then reading a utf-8 file
	    only works when iconv is available.  Writing a file in another
	    codepage uses the wrong kind of conversion.

	    codepages and utf-8 without the need for iconv.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/test52.in,

Solution:   Add a type cast.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.511
Problem:    Tags in Russian help files are in utf-8 encoding, which may be
	    different from 'encoding'.
Solution:   Use the "TAG_FILE_ENCODING" field in the tags file to specify the
	    encoding of the tags.  Convert help tags from 'encoding' to the
	    tag file encoding when searching for matches, do the reverse when
	    listing help tags.
Files:	    runtime/doc/tagsrch.txt, src/ex_cmds.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.512
Problem:    Translating "\"\n" is useless. (Gerfried Fuchs)

	    simplified. (Nikolay Molchanov)
Solution:   Only check if the access mode is right.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.514
Problem:    When a highlight/syntax group name contains invalid characters
	    there is no warning.

	    invalid characters.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.515
Problem:    When using the options window 'swapfile' is reset.
Solution:   Use ":setlocal" instead of ":set".
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.2.516
Problem:    The sign column cannot be seen, looks like there are two spaces
	    before the text. (Rob Retter)

	    src/screen.c, src/syntax.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.517
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multi-byte characters replaces
	    too many characters.  In Visual Block mode replacing with a
	    multi-byte character doesn't work.
Solution:   Adjust the operator end for the difference in byte length of the
	    original and the replaced character.  Insert all bytes of a
	    multi-byte character, take care of double-wide characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.518
Problem:    Last line of a window is not updated after using "J" and then "D".
	    (Adri Verhoef)
Solution:   When no line is found below a change that doesn't need updating,
	    update all lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.519
Problem:    Mac: cannot read/write files in MacRoman format.
Solution:   Do internal conversion from/to MacRoman to/from utf-8 and latin1.
	    (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.520 (extra)
Problem:    The NSIS installer is outdated.
Solution:   Make it work with NSIS 2.0.  Also include console executables for
	    Win 95/98/ME and Win NT/2000/XP.  Use LZWA compression.  Use
	    "/oname" to avoid having to rename files before running NSIS.
Files:	    Makefile, nsis/gvim.nsi

Patch 6.2.521
Problem:    When using silent Ex mode the "changing a readonly file" warning
	    is omitted but the one second wait isn't. (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   Skip the delay when "silent_mode" is set.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.522
Problem:    GUI: when changing 'cmdheight' in the gvimrc file the window
	    layout is messed up. (Keith Dart)
Solution:   Skip updating the window layout when changing 'cmdheight' while
	    still starting up.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.523
Problem:    When loading a session and aborting when a swap file already
	    exists, the user is left with useless windows. (Robert Webb)
Solution:   Load one file before creating the windows.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.524 (extra, after 6.2.520)
Problem:    Win32: (un)installing gvimext.dll may fail if it was used.
	    The desktop and start menu links are created for the current user
	    instead of all users.
	    Using the home directory as working directory for the links is a
	    bad idea for multi-user systems.
	    Cannot use Vim from the "Open With..." menu.
Solution:   Force a reboot if necessary. (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)  Also use
	    macros for the directory of the source and runtime files.  Use
	    "CSIDL_COMMON_*" instead of "CSIDL_*" when possible.
	    Do not specify a working directory in the links.
	    Add Vim to the "Open With..." menu. (Giuseppe Bilotta)
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c, src/dosinst.h, src/uninstal.c

Patch 6.2.525
Problem:    When the history contains a very long line ":history" causes a
	    crash. (Volker Kiefel)

Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.526
Problem:    When s:lang is "ja" the Japanese menus are not used.
Solution:   Add 'encoding' to the language when there is no charset.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.2.527
Problem:    The 2html script uses ":wincmd p", which breaks when using some
	    autocommands.
Solution:   Remember the window numbers and jump to them with ":wincmd w".
	    Also add XHTML support. (Panagiotis Issaris)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.528
Problem:    NetBeans: Changes of the "~" command are not reported.
Solution:   Call netbeans_inserted() after performing "~". (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also change NetBeans debugging to append to the log file.
	    Also fix that "~" in Visual block mode changes too much if there
	    are multi-byte characters.
Files:	    src/nbdebug.c, src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.529 (extra)
Problem:    VisVim only works for Admin.  Doing it for one user doesn't work.
	    (Alexandre Gouraud)
Solution:   When registering the module fails, simply continue.
Files:	    src/VisVim/VisVim.cpp

Patch 6.2.530
Problem:    Warning for missing prototype on the Amiga.
Solution:   Include time.h
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.2.531
Problem:    In silent ex mode no messages are given, which makes debugging
	    very difficult.
Solution:   Do output messages when 'verbose' is set.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.532 (extra)
Problem:    Compiling for Win32s with VC 4.1 doesn't work.
Solution:   Don't use CP_UTF8 if it's not defined.  Don't use CSIDL_COMMON*
	    when not defined.
Files:	    src/dosinst.h, src/fileio.c

Win32 console: After patch 6.2.398 Ex mode did not work. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Patch 6.3a.001
Problem:    Win32: if testing for the "--binary" option fails, diff isn't used
	    at all.
Solution:   Handle the "ok" flag properly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.3a.002
Problem:    NetBeans: An insert command from NetBeans beyond the end of a

Solution:   Use a local pos_T structure for the position.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.3a.003
Problem:    E315 error with auto-formatting comments. (Henry Van Roessel)
Solution:   Pass the line number to same_leader().
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.3a.004
Problem:    Test32 fails on Windows XP for the DJGPP version.  Renaming
	    test11.out fails.
Solution:   Don't try renaming, create new files to use for the test.
Files:	    src/testdir/test32.in, src/testdir/test32.ok

Patch 6.3a.005
Problem:    ":checkpath!" does not use 'includeexpr'.
Solution:   Use a file name that was found directly.  When a file was not
	    found and the located name is empty, use the rest of the line.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.006
Problem:    "yip" moves the cursor to the first yanked line, but not to the
	    first column.  Looks like not all text was yanked. (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the first column.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.007
Problem:    'cindent' recognizes "enum" but not "typedef enum".
Solution:   Skip over "typedef" before checking for "enum". (Helmut Stiegler)
	    Also avoid that searching for this item goes too far back.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/testdir/test3.in, src/testdir/test3.ok

Patch 6.3a.008 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: Some of the wide functions are not implemented,
	    resulting in file I/O to fail.  This depends on what Unicode
	    support is installed.
Solution:   Handle the failure and fall back to non-wide functions.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.009
Problem:    Win32: Completion of filenames does not work properly when
	    'encoding' differs from the active code page.
Solution:   Use wide functions for expanding wildcards when appropriate.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3a.010 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the window title that do not appear in the
	    active codepage are replaced by a question mark.
Solution:   Use DefWindowProcW() instead of DefWindowProc() when possible.
Files:	    src/glbl_ime.cpp, src/globals.h, src/proto/gui_w16.pro,
	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro, src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.011
Problem:    Using the explorer plugin changes a local directory to the global
	    directory.
Solution:   Don't use ":chdir" to restore the current directory.  Make
	    "expand('%:p')" remove "/../" and "/./" items from the path.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/explorer.vim, src/eval.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.012 (extra)
Problem:    On Windows 98 the installer doesn't work, don't even get the "I
	    agree" button.  The check for the path ending in "vim" makes the
	    browse dialog hard to use.  The default path when no previous Vim
	    is installed is "c:\vim" instead of "c:\Program Files\Vim".
Solution:   Remove the background gradient command.  Change the
	    .onVerifyInstDir function to a leave function for the directory
	    page.  Don't let the install program default to c:\vim when no
	    path could be found.
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.3a.013 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the menu that are not in the active codepage
	    are garbled.
Solution:   Convert menu strings from 'encoding' to the active codepage.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.014
Problem:    Using multi-byte text and highlighting in a statusline causes gaps
	    to appear. (Helmut Stiegler)
Solution:   Advance the column by text width instead of number of bytes.  Add
	    the vim_strnsize() function.
Files:	    src/charset.c, src/proto/charset.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3a.015
Problem:    Using the "select all" menu item when 'insertmode' is set and
	    clicking the mouse button doesn't return to Insert mode.  The
	    Buffers/Delete menu doesn't offer a choice to abandon a changed
	    buffer.  (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Don't use CTRL-\ CTRL-N.  Add ":confirm" for the Buffers menu
	    items.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.3a.016
Problem:    After cancelling the ":confirm" dialog the error message and
	    hit-enter prompt may not be displayed properly.
Solution:   Flush output after showing the dialog.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.3a.017
Problem:    servername() doesn't work when Vim was started with the "-X"

	    name.  (Robert Nowotniak)
Solution:   Force connecting to the X server when using client-server
	    commands.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/globals.h, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.018 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Compiler warning for return value of make_connection().
Solution:   Use void return type.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.019 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: typing non-latin1 characters doesn't work.
Solution:   Invoke _OnChar() directly to avoid that the argument is truncated
	    to a byte.  Convert the UTF-16 character to bytes according to
	    'encoding' and ignore 'termencoding'.  Same for _OnSysChar().
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.020 (extra)
Problem:    Missing support for AROS (AmigaOS reimplementation).  Amiga GUI
	    doesn't work.
Solution:   Add AROS support.  (Adam Chodorowski)
	    Fix Amiga GUI problems. (Georg Steger, Ali Akcaagac)
Files:	    Makefile, src/Make_aros.mak, src/gui_amiga.c, src/gui_amiga.h,
	    src/memfile.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.3a.021 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Can't compile with X11 but without GUI.
Solution:   Put use of "gui.in_use" inside an #ifdef.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.022
Problem:    When typing Tabs when 'softtabstop' is used and 'list' is set a
	    tab is counted for two spaces.
Solution:   Use the "L" flag in 'cpoptions' to tell whether a tab is counted
	    as two spaces or as 'tabstop'. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/edit.c

Patch 6.3a.023
Problem:    Completion on the command line doesn't handle backslashes
	    properly.  Only the tail of matches is shown, even when not
	    completing filenames.
Solution:   When turning the string into a pattern double backslashes.  Don't
	    omit the path when not expanding files or directories.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3a.024
Problem:    The "save all" toolbar item fails for buffers that don't have a
	    name.  When using ":wa" or closing the Vim window and there are
	    nameless buffers, browsing for a name may cause the name being
	    given to the wrong buffer or not stored properly.  ":browse" only
	    worked for one file.
Solution:   Use ":confirm browse" for "save all".
	    Pass buffer argument to setfname().  Restore "browse" flag and
	    "forceit" after doing the work for one file.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_cmds2.c,
	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/fileio.c, src/memline.c,

Problem:    Editing files on Windows 98 doesn't work when 'encoding' is
	    "utf-8" (Antoine Mechelynck)
	    Warning for missing function prototype.
Solution:   For all wide functions check if it failed because it is not
	    implemented.  Use ANSI function declaration for char_to_string().
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.027 (extra, after 6.3a.026)
Problem:    Compiler warning for function argument.
Solution:   Declare both char and WCHAR arrays.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.028

Solution:   Make a copy of the redo buffer when executing a function.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.3b.001 (extra)

Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak

Patch 6.3b.002
Problem:    Win32: conversion during file write fails when a double-byte
	    character is split over two writes.
Solution:   Fix the conversion retry without a trailing byte. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3b.003 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When compiling with Borland C 5.5 and 'encoding' is "utf-8"
	    then Vim can't open files under MS-Windows 98. (Antoine J.
	    Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't use _wstat(), _wopen() and _wfopen() in this situation.
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3b.004
Problem:    ":helpgrep" includes a trailing CR in the text line.
Solution:   Remove the CR.
Files:	    src/quickfix.c

Patch 6.3b.006
Problem:    When using "mswin.vim", CTRL-V in Insert mode leaves cursor before
	    last pasted character.  (Mathew Davis)
Solution:   Use the same Paste() function as in menu.vim.
Files:	    runtime/mswin.vim

Patch 6.3b.007
Problem:    Session file doesn't restore view on windows properly. (Robert
	    Webb)

	    that the view, cursor position and size are restored properly.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.3b.008

	    Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't assume that using getexline() means the command was typed.

Patch 6.3b.009 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the -P argument is not found in a window title, there
	    is no error message.
Solution:   When the window can't be found give an error message and exit.
	    Also use try/except to catch failing to open the MDI window.
	    (Michael Wookey)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.3b.010
Problem:    Win32: Using the "-D" argument and expanding arguments may cause a
	    hang, because the terminal isn't initialized yet. (Vince Negri)
Solution:   Don't go into debug mode before the terminal is initialized.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.3b.011
Problem:    Using CTRL-\ e while obtaining an expression aborts the command
	    line. (Hari Krishna Dara)

	    lines than what is room for. (Shizhu Pan)
Solution:   When deciding to call shell_resized(), also compare the text area
	    size with Rows and Columns, not just with screen_Rows and
	    screen_Columns.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Fixed							*fixed-6.4*
-----

"dFxd;" deleted the character under the cursor, "d;" didn't remember the
exclusiveness of the motion.

When using "set laststatus=2 cmdheight=2" in the .gvimrc you may only get one
line for the cmdline. (Christian Robinson)  Invoke command_height() after the
GUI has started up.

Gcc would warn "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict -aliasing
rules".  Avoid using typecasts for variable pointers.

Gcc 3.x interprets the -MM argument differently.  Change "-I /path" to
"-isystem /path" for "make depend".


Patch 6.3.001
Problem:    ":browse split" gives the file selection dialog twice. (Gordon
	    Bazeley)  Same problem for ":browse diffpatch".
Solution:   Reset cmdmod.browse before calling do_ecmd().

Patch 6.3.002
Problem:    When using translated help files with non-ASCII latin1 characters
	    in the first line the utf-8 detection is wrong.
Solution:   Properly detect utf-8 characters.  When a mix of encodings is
	    detected continue with the next language and avoid a "no matches"
	    error because of "got_int" being set.  Add the directory name to
	    the error message for a duplicate tag.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.3.003
Problem:    Crash when using a console dialog and the first choice does not

Patch 6.3.005
Problem:    Crash when searching for a pattern with a character offset and
	    starting in a closed fold. (Frank Butler)

	    that a pattern with a character offset relative to the end isn't
	    read back from the viminfo properly.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3.006
Problem:    ":breakadd file *foo" prepends the current directory to the file

Solution:   Save the command line when invoking the completion function.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3.012
Problem:    Internal lalloc(0) error when using a complicated multi-line
	    pattern in a substitute command. (Luc Hermitte)
Solution:   Avoid going past the end of a line.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.3.013
Problem:    Crash when editing a command line and typing CTRL-R = to evaluate

	    wrong. (Simon Liang)
Solution:   Use the part of the locale name after "zh_".
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.3.015
Problem:    The string that winrestcmd() returns may end in garbage.
Solution:   NUL-terminate the string. (Walter Briscoe)

	    delete a word but only a combining character of the first
	    character, if there is one. (Raphael Finkel)
Solution:   Correctly check that one character is being deleted.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3.021
Problem:    When the last character of a file name is a multi-byte character
	    and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot be edited.
Solution:   Check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte character.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.022 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the last character of a file name is a multi-byte
	    character and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot
	    be written.  A trail byte that is a space makes that a file cannot
	    be opened from the command line.
Solution:   Recognize double-byte characters when parsing the command line.
	    In mch_stat() check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte
	    character.  (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.023
Problem:    When the "to" part of a mapping starts with its "from" part,
	    abbreviations for the same characters is not possible.  For
	    example, when <Space> is mapped to something that starts with a
	    space, typing <Space> does not expand abbreviations.
Solution:   Only disable expanding abbreviations when a mapping is not
	    remapped, don't disable it when the RHS of a mapping starts with
	    the LHS.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.3.024
Problem:    In a few places a string in allocated memory is not terminated
	    with a NUL.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in script_get(), gui_do_findrepl() and
	    serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/gui.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.025 (extra)
Problem:    Missing NUL for list of server names.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.026
Problem:    When ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim contains a command that
	    reloads the colors an endless loop and/or a crash may occur.
Solution:   Only free the old value of an option when it was originally
	    allocated.  Limit recursiveness of init_highlight() to 5 levels.
Files:	    src/option.c, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.027
Problem:    VMS: Writing a file may insert extra CR characters.  Not all
	    terminals are recognized correctly.  Vt320 doesn't support colors.
	    Environment variables are not expanded correctly.
Solution:   Use another method to write files.  Add vt320 termcap codes for
	    colors.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/misc1.c, src/os_unix.c, src/structs.h,
	    src/term.c

Patch 6.3.028
Problem:    When appending to a file the BOM marker may be written.  (Alex
	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Do not write the BOM marker when appending.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.029
Problem:    Crash when inserting a line break. (Walter Briscoe)
Solution:   In the syntax highlighting code, don't use an old state after a
	    change was made, current_col may be past the end of the line.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.030
Problem:    GTK 2: Crash when sourcing a script that deletes the menus, sets
	    'encoding' to "utf-8" and loads the menus again.  GTK error
	    message when tooltip text is in a wrong encoding.
Solution:   Don't copy characters from the old screen to the new screen when
	    switching 'encoding' to utf-8, they may be invalid.  Only set the
	    tooltip when it is valid utf-8.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/mbyte.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.031
Problem:    When entering a mapping and pressing Tab halfway the command line
	    isn't redrawn properly. (Adri Verhoef)

	    lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.040
Problem:    Error handling does not always work properly and may cause a
	    buffer to be marked as if it's viewed in a window while it isn't.
	    Also when selecting "Abort" at the attention prompt.
Solution:   Add enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() functions to move
	    saving/restoring things for error handling to one place.
	    Clear a buffer read error when it's unloaded.

	    scrolling the text up. (Gautam)
Solution:   Scroll over the closed fold.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.3.043
Problem:    'hlsearch' highlighting sometimes disappears when inserting text
	    in PHP code with syntax highlighting. (Marcel Svitalsky)

	    index.  The pointers may become invalid when searching in other
	    lines.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.044 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: When 'linespace' is non-zero the Insert mode cursor leaves

	    behavior, especially for a modeline. (Ciaran McCreesh)
Solution:   Don't allow setting termcap options or 'printdevice' in a
	    modeline.  Don't list options for "termcap" and "all" in a
	    modeline.  Don't allow unusual characters in 'filetype', 'syntax',
	    'backupext', 'keymap', 'patchmode' and 'langmenu'.

Patch 6.3.052 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: typed keys that are not ASCII may not work properly.
	    For example with a Russian input method. (Jiri Jezdinsky)

Patch 6.3.053
Problem:    Win32: ":loadview" cannot find a file with non-ASCII characters.
	    (Valerie Kondakoff)

Problem:    Can't use getcmdline(), getcmdpos() or setcmdpos() with <C-R>=
	    when editing a command line.  Using <C-\>e may crash Vim. (Peter
	    Winters)
Solution:   When moving ccline out of the way for recursive use, make it
	    available to the functions that need it.  Also save and restore

	    the end of getcmdline().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3.056
Problem:    The last characters of a multi-byte file name may not be displayed

==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-7*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 6.x to 7.0.

A ":write file" command no longer resets the 'modified' flag of the buffer,
unless the '+' flag is in 'cpoptions' |cpo-+|.  This was illogical, since the
buffer is still modified compared to the original file.  And when undoing
all changes the file would actually be marked modified.  It does mean that
":quit" fails now.

":helpgrep" now uses a help window to display a match.

In an argument list double quotes could be used to include spaces in a file
name.  This caused a difference between ":edit" and ":next" for escaping
double quotes and it is incompatible with some versions of Vi.
	Command			Vim 6.x	file name	Vim 7.x file name ~
	:edit foo\"888		foo"888			foo"888
	:next foo\"888		foo888			foo"888
	:next a\"b c\"d		ab cd			a"b  and  c"d

In a |literal-string| a single quote can be doubled to get one.
":echo 'a''b'" would result in "a b", but now that two quotes stand for one it
results in "a'b".

When overwriting a file with ":w! fname" there was no warning for when "fname"
was being edited by another Vim.  Vim now gives an error message |E768|.

The support for Mac OS 9 has been removed.

Files ending in .tex now have 'filetype' set to "context", "plaintex", or
"tex".  |ft-tex-plugin|


Minor incompatibilities:

For filetype detection: For many types, use */.dir/filename instead of
~/.dir/filename, so that it also works for other user's files.

For quite a few filetypes the indent settings have been moved from the
filetype plugin to the indent plugin.  If you used: >
	:filetype plugin on
Then some indent settings may be missing.  You need to use: >
	:filetype plugin indent on

":0verbose" now sets 'verbose' to zero instead of one.

Removed the old and incomplete "VimBuddy" code.

Buffers without a name report "No Name" instead of "No File".  It was
confusing for buffers with a name and 'buftype' set to "nofile".

When ":file xxx" is used in a buffer without a name, the alternate file name
isn't set.  This avoids creating buffers without a name, they are not useful.

The "2html.vim" script now converts closed folds to HTML.  This means the HTML
looks like it's displayed, with the same folds open and closed.  Use "zR", or
"let html_ignore_folding=1", if no folds should appear in the HTML. (partly by
Carl Osterwisch)
Diff mode is now also converted to HTML as it is displayed.

Win32: The effect of the <F10> key depended on 'winaltkeys'.  Now it depends
on whether <F10> has been mapped or not.  This allows mapping <F10> without
changing 'winaltkeys'.

When 'octal' is in 'nrformats' and using CTRL-A on "08" it became "018", which
is illogical.  Now it becomes "9".  The leading zero(s) is(are) removed to
avoid the number becoming octal after incrementing "009" to "010".

When 'encoding' is set to a Unicode encoding, the value for 'fileencodings'
now includes "default" before "latin1".  This means that for files with 8-bit
encodings the default is to use the encoding specified by the environment, if
possible.  Previously latin1 would always be used, which is wrong in a
non-latin1 environment, such as Russian.

Previously Vim would exit when there are two windows, both of them displaying
a help file, and using ":quit".  Now only the window is closed.

"-w {scriptout}" only works when {scriptout} doesn't start with a digit.
Otherwise it's used to set the 'window' option.

Previously <Home> and <xHome> could be mapped separately.  This had the
disadvantage that all mappings (with modifiers) had to be duplicated, since
you can't be sure what the keyboard generates.  Now all <xHome> are internally
translated to <Home>, both for the keys and for mappings.  Also for <xEnd>,
<xF1>, etc.

":put" now leaves the cursor on the last inserted line.

When a .gvimrc file exists then 'compatible' is off, just like when a ".vimrc"
file exists.

When making a string upper-case with "vlllU" or similar then the German sharp
s is replaced with "SS".  This does not happen with "~" to avoid backwards
compatibility problems and because "SS" can't be changed back to a sharp s.

"gd" previously found the very first occurrence of a variable in a function,
that could be the function argument without type.  Now it finds the position
where the type is given.

The line continuation in functions was not taken into account, line numbers in
errors were logical lines, not lines in the sourced file.  That made it
difficult to locate errors.  Now the line number in the sourced file is
reported, relative to the function start.  This also means that line numbers
for ":breakadd func" are different.

When defining a user command with |:command| the special items could be
abbreviated.  This caused unexpected behavior, such as <li> being recognized
as <line1>.  The items can no longer be abbreviated.

When executing a FileChangedRO autocommand it is no longer allowed to switch
to another buffer or edit another file.  This is to prevent crashes (the event
is triggered deep down in the code where changing buffers is not anticipated).
It is still possible to reload the buffer.

At the |more-prompt| and the |hit-enter-prompt|, when the 'more' option is
set, the 'k', 'u', 'g' and 'b' keys are now used to scroll back to previous
messages.  Thus they are no longer used as typeahead.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-7*

Vim script enhancements					*new-vim-script*
-----------------------

In Vim scripts the following types have been added:

	|List|		ordered list of items
	|Dictionary|	associative array of items
	|Funcref|	reference to a function

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.

The |string()| function can be used to get a string representation of a
variable.  Works for Numbers, Strings and composites of them.  Then |eval()|
can be used to turn the string back into the variable value.

The |:let| command can now use "+=", "-=" and ".=": >
	:let var += expr	" works like :let var = var + expr
	:let var -= expr	" works like :let var = var - expr
	:let var .= string	" works like :let var = var . string

With the |:profile| command you can find out where your function or script
is wasting time.

In the Python interface vim.eval() also handles Dictionaries and Lists.
|python-eval| (G. Sumner Hayes)

The |getscript| plugin was added as a convenient way to update scripts from
www.vim.org automatically. (Charles Campbell)

The |vimball| plugin was added as a convenient way to distribute a set of
files for a plugin (plugin file, autoload script, documentation). (Charles
Campbell)


Spell checking						*new-spell*
--------------

Spell checking has been integrated in Vim.  There were a few implementations
with scripts, but they were slow and/or required an external program.

The 'spell'	   option is used to switch spell checking on or off
The 'spelllang'    option is used to specify the accepted language(s)
The 'spellfile'    option specifies where new words are added
The 'spellsuggest' option specifies the methods used for making suggestions

The |]s| and |[s| commands can be used to move to the next or previous error
The |zg| and |zw| commands can be used to add good and wrong words
The |z=|	  command can be used to list suggestions and correct the word
The |:mkspell|    command is used to generate a Vim spell file from word lists

The "undercurl" highlighting attribute was added to nicely point out spelling
mistakes in the GUI (based on patch from Marcin Dalecki).
The "guisp" color can be used to give it a color different from foreground and
background.
The number of possible different highlight attributes was raised from about
220 to over 30000.  This allows for the attributes of spelling to be combined
with syntax highlighting attributes.  This is also used for syntax
highlighting and marking the Visual area.

Much more info here: |spell|.


Omni completion					*new-omni-completion*
---------------

This could also be called "intellisense", but that is a trademark.  It is a
smart kind of completion.  The text in front of the cursor is inspected to
figure out what could be following.  This may suggest struct and class
members, system functions, etc.

Use CTRL-X CTRL-O in Insert mode to start the completion.  |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|

The 'omnifunc' option is set by filetype plugins to define the function that
figures out the completion.

Currently supported languages:
	C					|ft-c-omni|
	(X)HTML with CSS			|ft-html-omni|
	JavaScript				|ft-javascript-omni|
	PHP					|ft-php-omni|
	Python
	Ruby					|ft-ruby-omni|
	SQL					|ft-sql-omni|
	XML					|ft-xml-omni|
	any language with syntax highlighting	|ft-syntax-omni|

You can add your own omni completion scripts.

When the 'completeopt' option contains "menu" then matches for Insert mode
completion are displayed in a (rather primitive) popup menu.


MzScheme interface					*new-MzScheme*
------------------

The MzScheme interpreter is supported. |MzScheme|

The |:mzscheme| command can be used to execute MzScheme commands
The |:mzfile|   command can be used to execute an MzScheme script file

This depends on Vim being compiled with the |+mzscheme| feature.


Printing multi-byte text				*new-print-multi-byte*
------------------------

The |:hardcopy| command now supports printing multi-byte characters when using
PostScript.

The 'printmbcharset' and 'printmbfont' options are used for this.
Also see |postscript-cjk-printing|.  (Mike Williams)


Tab pages						*new-tab-pages*
---------

A tab page is a page with one or more windows with a label (aka tab) at the top.
By clicking on the label you can quickly switch between the tab pages.  And
with the keyboard, using the |gt| (Goto Tab) command.  This is a convenient
way to work with many windows.

To start Vim with each file argument in a separate tab page use the |-p|
argument.  The maximum number of pages can be set with 'tabpagemax'.

The line with tab labels is either made with plain text and highlighting or
with a GUI mechanism.  The GUI labels look better but are only available on a
few systems.  The line can be customized with 'tabline', 'guitablabel' and
'guitabtooltip'.  Whether it is displayed is set with 'showtabline'.  Whether
to use the GUI labels is set with the "e" flag in 'guioptions'.

The |:tab| command modifier can be used to have most commands that open a new
window open a new tab page instead.

The |--remote-tab| argument can be used to edit a file in a new tab page in an
already running Vim server.

Variables starting with "t:" are local to a tab page.

More info here: |tabpage|
Most of the GUI stuff was implemented by Yegappan Lakshmanan.


Undo branches						*new-undo-branches*
-------------

Previously there was only one line of undo-redo.  If, after undoing a number
of changes, a new change was made all the undone changes were lost.  This
could lead to accidentally losing work.

Vim now makes an undo branch in this situation.  Thus you can go back to the
text after any change, even if they were undone.  So long as you do not run
into 'undolevels', when undo information is freed up to limit the memory used.

To be able to navigate the undo branches each change is numbered sequentially.
The commands |g-| and |:earlier| go back in time, to older changes.  The
commands |g+| and |:later| go forward in time, to newer changes.

The changes are also timestamped.  Use ":earlier 10m" to go to the text as it
was about ten minutes earlier.

The |:undolist| command can be used to get an idea of which undo branches
exist.  The |:undo| command now takes an argument to directly jump to a
specific position in this list.  The |changenr()| function can be used to
obtain the change number.

There is no graphical display of the tree with changes, navigation can be
quite confusing.


Extended Unicode support				*new-more-unicode*
------------------------

Previously only two combining characters were displayed.  The limit is now
raised to 6.  This can be set with the 'maxcombine' option.  The default is
still 2.

|ga| now shows all combining characters, not just the first two.

Previously only 16 bit Unicode characters were supported for displaying.  Now
the full 32 bit character set can be used.  Unless manually disabled at
compile time to save a bit of memory.

For pattern matching it is now possible to search for individual composing
characters. |patterns-composing|

The |8g8| command searches for an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence.


More highlighting				*new-more-highlighting*
-----------------

Highlighting matching parens:

When moving the cursor through the text and it is on a paren, then the
matching paren can be highlighted.  This uses the new |CursorMoved|
autocommand event.

This means some commands are executed every time you move the cursor.  If this
slows you down too much switch it off with: >
	:NoMatchParen

See |matchparen| for more information.

The plugin uses the |:match| command.  It now supports three match patterns.
The plugin uses the third one.  The first one is for the user and the second
one can be used by another plugin.

Highlighting the cursor line and column:

The 'cursorline' and 'cursorcolumn' options have been added.  These highlight
the screen line and screen column of the cursor.  This makes the cursor
position easier to spot.  'cursorcolumn' is also useful to align text.  This
may make screen updating quite slow.  The CursorColumn and CursorLine
highlight groups allow changing the colors used.  |hl-CursorColumn|
|hl-CursorLine|

The number of possible different highlight attributes was raised from about
220 to over 30000.  This allows for the attributes of spelling to be combined
with syntax highlighting attributes.  This is also used for syntax
highlighting, marking the Visual area, CursorColumn, etc.


Translated manual pages					*new-manpage-trans*
-----------------------

The manual page of Vim and associated programs is now also available in
several other languages.

French  - translated by David Blanchet
Italian - translated by Antonio Colombo
Russian - translated by Vassily Ragosin
Polish  - translated by Mikolaj Machowski

The Unix Makefile installs the Italian manual pages in .../man/it/man1/,
.../man/it.ISO8859-1/man1/ and .../man/it.UTF-8/man1/.  There appears to be no
standard for what encoding goes in the "it" directory, the 8-bit encoded file
is used there as a best guess.
Other languages are installed in similar places.
The translated pages are not automatically installed when Vim was configured
with "--disable-nls", but "make install-languages install-tool-languages" will
do it anyway.


Internal grep						*new-vimgrep*
-------------

The ":vimgrep" command can be used to search for a pattern in a list of files.
This is like the ":grep" command, but no external program is used.  Besides
better portability, handling of different file encodings and using multi-line
patterns, this also allows grepping in compressed and remote files.
|:vimgrep|.

If you want to use the search results in a script you can use the
|getqflist()| function.

To grep files in various directories the "**" pattern can be used.  It expands
into an arbitrary depth of directories.  "**" can be used in all places where
file names are expanded, thus also with |:next| and |:args|.


Scroll back in messages					*new-scroll-back*
-----------------------

When displaying messages, at the |more-prompt| and the |hit-enter-prompt|, The
'k', 'u', 'g' and 'b' keys can be used to scroll back to previous messages.
This is especially useful for commands such as ":syntax", ":autocommand" and
":highlight".  This is implemented in a generic way thus it works for all
commands and highlighting is kept.  Only works when the 'more' option is set.
Previously it only partly worked for ":clist".

The |g<| command can be used to see the last page of messages after you have
hit <Enter> at the |hit-enter-prompt|.  Then you can scroll further back.


Cursor past end of the line				*new-onemore*
---------------------------

When the 'virtualedit' option contains "onemore" the cursor can move just past
the end of the line.  As if it's on top of the line break.

This makes some commands more consistent.  Previously the cursor was always
past the end of the line if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi
compatible.  It may also break some plugins or Vim scripts.  Use with care!

The patch was provided by Mattias Flodin.


POSIX compatibility					*new-posix*
-------------------

The POSIX test suite was used to verify POSIX compatibility.  A number of
problems have been fixed to make Vim more POSIX compatible.  Some of them
conflict with traditional Vi or expected behavior.  The $VIM_POSIX environment
variable can be set to get POSIX compatibility.  See |posix|.

Items that were fixed for both Vi and POSIX compatibility:
- repeating "R" with a count only overwrites text once; added the 'X' flag to
  'cpoptions' |cpo-X|
- a vertical movement command that moves to a non-existing line fails; added
  the '-' flag to 'cpoptions' |cpo--|
- when preserving a file and doing ":q!" the file can be recovered; added the
  '&' flag to 'cpoptions' |cpo-&|
- The 'window' option is partly implemented.  It specifies how much CTRL-F and
  CTRL-B scroll when there is one window.  The "-w {number}" argument is now
  accepted.  "-w {scriptout}" only works when {scriptout} doesn't start with a
  digit.
- Allow "-c{command}" argument, no space between "-c" and {command}.
- When writing a file with ":w!" don't reset 'readonly' when 'Z' is present in
  'cpoptions'.
- Allow 'l' and '#' flags for ":list", ":print" and ":number".
- Added the '.' flag to 'cpoptions': ":cd" fails when the buffer is modified.
- In Ex mode with an empty buffer ":read file" doesn't keep an empty line
  above or below the new lines.
- Remove a backslash before a NL for the ":global" command.
- When ":append", ":insert" or ":change" is used with ":global", get the
  inserted lines from the command.  Can use backslash-NL to separate lines.
- Can use ":global /pat/ visual" to execute Normal mode commands at each
  matched line.  Use "Q" to continue and go to the next line.
- The |:open| command has been partially implemented.  It stops Ex mode, but
  redraws the whole screen, not just one line as open mode is supposed to do.
- Support using a pipe to read the output from and write input to an external
  command.  Added the 'shelltemp' option and has("filterpipe").
- In ex silent mode the ":set" command output is displayed.
- The ":@@" and ":**" give an error message when no register was used before.
- The search pattern "[]-`]" matches ']', '^', '_' and '`'.
- Autoindent for ":insert" is using the line below the insert.
- Autoindent for ":change" is using the first changed line.
- Editing Ex command lines is not done in cooked mode, because CTRL-D and
  CTRL-T cannot be handled then.
- In Ex mode, "1,3" prints three lines.  "%" prints all lines.
- In Ex mode "undo" would undo all changes since Ex mode was started.
- Implemented the 'prompt' option.


Debugger support					*new-debug-support*
----------------

The 'balloonexpr' option has been added.  This is a generic way to implement
balloon functionality.  You can use it to show info for the word under the
mouse pointer.


Remote file explorer					*new-netrw-explore*
--------------------

The netrw plugin now also supports viewing a directory, when "scp://" is used.
Deleting and renaming files is possible.

To avoid duplicating a lot of code, the previous file explorer plugin has been
integrated in the netrw plugin.  This means browsing local and remote files
works the same way.

":browse edit" and ":browse split" use the netrw plugin when it's available
and a GUI dialog is not possible.

The netrw plugin is maintained by Charles Campbell.


Define an operator					*new-define-operator*
------------------

Previously it was not possible to define your own operator; a command that is
followed by a {motion}.  Vim 7 introduces the 'operatorfunc' option and the
|g@| operator.  This makes it possible to define a mapping that works like an
operator.  The actual work is then done by a function, which is invoked
through the |g@| operator.

See |:map-operator| for the explanation and an example.


Mapping to an expression				*new-map-expression*
------------------------

The {rhs} argument of a mapping can be an expression.  That means the
resulting characters can depend on the context.  Example: >
	:inoremap <expr> . InsertDot()
Here the dot will be mapped to whatever InsertDot() returns.

This also works for abbreviations.  See |:map-<expr>| for the details.


Visual and Select mode mappings				*new-map-select*
-------------------------------

Previously Visual mode mappings applied both to Visual and Select mode.  With
a trick to have the mappings work in Select mode like they would in Visual
mode.

Commands have been added to define mappings for Visual and Select mode
separately: |:xmap| and |:smap|.  With the associated "noremap" and "unmap"
commands.

The same is done for menus: |:xmenu|, |:smenu|, etc.


Location list						*new-location-list*
-------------

The support for a per-window quickfix list (location list) is added. The
location list can be displayed in a location window (similar to the quickfix
window).  You can open more than one location list window.  A set of commands
similar to the quickfix commands are added to browse the location list.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Tamil in TSCII encoding (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Greek in cp737 (Panagiotis Louridas)
Polish-slash (HS6_06)
Ukrainian-jcuken (Anatoli Sakhnik)
Kana (Edward L. Fox)


New message translations: ~

The Ukrainian messages are now also available in cp1251.
Vietnamese message translations and menu. (Phan Vinh Thinh)


Others: ~

The |:read| command has the |++edit| argument.  This means it will use the
detected 'fileformat', 'fileencoding' and other options for the buffer.  This
also fixes the problem that editing a compressed file didn't set these
options.

The Netbeans interface was updated for Sun Studio 10.  The protocol number
goes from 2.2 to 2.3. (Gordon Prieur)

Mac: When starting up Vim will load the $VIMRUNTIME/macmap.vim script to
define default command-key mappings. (mostly by Benji Fisher)

Mac: Add the selection type to the clipboard, so that Block, line and
character selections can be used between two Vims. (Eckehard Berns)
Also fixes the problem that setting 'clipboard' to "unnamed" breaks using
"yyp".

Mac: GUI font selector. (Peter Cucka)

Mac: support for multi-byte characters. (Da Woon Jung)
This doesn't always work properly.  If you see text drawing problems try
switching the 'macatsui' option off.

Mac: Support the xterm mouse in the non-GUI version.

Mac: better integration with Xcode.  Post a fake mouse-up event after the odoc
event and the drag receive handler to work around a stall after Vim loads a
file.  Fixed an off-by-one line number error. (Da Woon Jung)

Mac: When started from Finder change directory to the file being edited or the
user home directory.

Added the t_SI and t_EI escape sequences for starting and ending Insert mode.
To be used to set the cursor shape to a bar or a block.  No default values,
they are not supported by termcap/terminfo.

GUI font selector for Motif. (Marcin Dalecki)

Nicer toolbar buttons for Motif. (Marcin Dalecki)

Mnemonics for the Motif find/replace dialog. (Marcin Dalecki)

Included a few improvements for Motif from Marcin Dalecki.  Draw label
contents ourselves to make them handle fonts in a way configurable by Vim and
a bit less dependent on the X11 font management.

Autocommands can be defined local to a buffer.  This means they will also work
when the buffer does not have a name or no specific name.  See
|autocmd-buflocal|.  (Yakov Lerner)

For xterm most combinations of modifiers with function keys are recognized.
|xterm-modifier-keys|

When 'verbose' is set the output of ":highlight" will show where a highlight
item was last set.
When 'verbose' is set the output of the ":map", ":abbreviate", ":command",
":function" and ":autocmd" commands will show where it was last defined.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

":function /pattern" lists functions matching the pattern.

"1gd" can be used like "gd" but ignores matches in a {} block that ends before
the cursor position.  Likewise for "1gD" and "gD".

'scrolljump' can be set to a negative number to scroll a percentage of the
window height.

The |v:scrollstart| variable has been added to help find the location in
your script that causes the hit-enter prompt.

To make it possible to handle the situation that a file is being edited that
is already being edited by another Vim instance, the |SwapExists| event has
been added.  The |v:swapname|, |v:swapchoice| and |v:swapcommand| variables
can be used, for example to use the |client-server| functionality to bring the
other Vim to the foreground.
When starting Vim with a "-t tag" argument, there is an existing swapfile and
the user selects "quit" or "abort" then exit Vim.

Undo now also restores the '< and '> marks.  "gv" selects the same area as
before the change and undo.

When editing a search pattern for a "/" or "?" command and 'incsearch' is set
CTRL-L can be used to add a character from the current match.  CTRL-R CTRL-W
will add a word, but exclude the part of the word that was already typed.

Ruby interface: add line number methods. (Ryan Paul)

The $MYVIMRC environment variable is set to the first found vimrc file.
The $MYGVIMRC environment variable is set to the first found gvimrc file.

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-7*

":helpgrep" accepts a language specifier after the pattern: "pat@it".

Moved the help for printing to a separate help file.  It's quite a lot now.

When doing completion for ":!cmd", ":r !cmd" or ":w !cmd" executable files are
found in $PATH instead of looking for ordinary files in the current directory.

When ":silent" is used and a backwards range is given for an Ex command the
range is swapped automatically instead of asking if that is OK.

The pattern matching code was changed from a recursive function to an
iterative mechanism.  This avoids out-of-stack errors.  State is stored in
allocated memory, running out of memory can always be detected.  Allows
matching more complex things, but Vim may seem to hang while doing that.

Previously some options were always evaluated in the |sandbox|.  Now that only
happens when the option was set from a modeline or in secure mode.  Applies to
'balloonexpr', 'foldexpr', 'foldtext' and 'includeexpr'. (Sumner Hayes)

Some commands and expressions could have nasty side effects, such as using
CTRL-R = while editing a search pattern and the expression invokes a function
that jumps to another window.  The |textlock| has been added to prevent this
from happening.

":breakadd here" and ":breakdel here" can be used to set or delete a
breakpoint at the cursor.

It is now possible to define a function with: >
	:exe "func Test()\n ...\n endfunc"

The tutor was updated to make it simpler to use and text was added to explain
a few more important commands.  Used ideas from Gabriel Zachmann.

Unix: When libcall() fails obtain an error message with dlerror() and display
it. (Johannes Zellner)

Mac and Cygwin: When editing an existing file make the file name the same case
of the edited file.  Thus when typing ":e os_UNIX.c" the file name becomes
"os_unix.c".

Added "nbsp" in 'listchars'. (David Blanchet)

Added the "acwrite" value for the 'buftype' option.  This is for a buffer that
does not have a name that refers to a file and is written with BufWriteCmd
autocommands.

For lisp indenting and matching parenthesis: (Sergey Khorev)
- square brackets are recognized properly
- #\(, #\), #\[ and #\] are recognized as character literals
- Lisp line comments (delimited by semicolon) are recognized

Added the "count" argument to match(), matchend() and matchstr(). (Ilya Sher)

winnr() takes an optional "$" or "#" argument.  (Nikolai Weibull, Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Added 's' flag to search(): set ' mark if cursor moved. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Added 'n' flag to search(): don't move the cursor. (Nikolai Weibull)
Added 'c' flag to search(): accept match at the cursor.
Added 'e' flag to search(): move to end of the match. (Benji Fisher)
Added 'p' flag to search(): return number of sub-pattern. (Benji Fisher)
These also apply to searchpos(), searchpair() and searchpairpos().

The search() and searchpair() functions have an extra argument to specify
where to stop searching.  Speeds up searches that should not continue too far.

When uncompressing fails in the gzip plugin, give an error message but don't
delete the raw text.  Helps if the file has a .gz extension but is not
actually compressed. (Andrew Pimlott)

When C, C++ or IDL syntax is used, may additionally load doxygen syntax.
(Michael Geddes)

Support setting 'filetype' and 'syntax' to "aaa.bbb" for "aaa" plus "bbb"
filetype or syntax.

The ":registers" command now displays multi-byte characters properly.

VMS: In the usage message mention that a slash can be used to make a flag
upper case.  Add color support to the builtin vt320 terminal codes.
(Zoltan Arpadffy)

For the '%' item in 'viminfo', allow a number to set a maximum for the number
of buffers.

For recognizing the file type: When a file looks like a shell script, check
for an "exec" command that starts the tcl interpreter. (suggested by Alexios
Zavras)

Support conversion between utf-8 and latin9 (iso-8859-15) internally, so that
digraphs still work when iconv is not available.

When a session file is loaded while editing an unnamed, empty buffer that
buffer is wiped out.  Avoids that there is an unused buffer in the buffer
list.

Win32: When libintl.dll supports bind_textdomain_codeset(), use it.
(NAKADAIRA Yukihiro)

Win32: Vim was not aware of hard links on NTFS file systems.  These are
detected now for when 'backupcopy' is "auto".  Also fixed a bogus "file has
been changed since reading it" error for links.

When foldtext() finds no text after removing the comment leader, use the
second line of the fold.  Helps for C-style /* */ comments where the first
line is just "/*".

When editing the same file from two systems (e.g., Unix and MS-Windows) there
mostly was no warning for an existing swap file, because the name of the
edited file differs (e.g., y:\dir\file vs /home/me/dir/file).  Added a flag to
the swap file to indicate it is in the same directory as the edited file.  The
used path then doesn't matter and the check for editing the same file is much
more reliable.

Unix: When editing a file through a symlink the swap file would use the name
of the symlink.  Now use the name of the actual file, so that editing the same
file twice is detected. (suggestions by Stefano Zacchiroli and James Vega)

Client-server communication now supports 'encoding'.  When setting 'encoding'
in a Vim server to "utf-8", and using "vim --remote fname" in a console,
"fname" is converted from the console encoding to utf-8.  Also allows Vims
with different 'encoding' settings to exchange messages.

Internal: Changed ga_room into ga_maxlen, so that it doesn't need to be
incremented/decremented each time.

When a register is empty it is not stored in the viminfo file.

Removed the tcltags script, it's obsolete.

":redir @*>>" and ":redir @+>>" append to the clipboard.  Better check for
invalid characters after the register name. |:redir|

":redir => variable" and ":redir =>> variable" write or append to a variable.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan) |:redir|

":redir @{a-z}>>" appends to register a to z. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The 'verbosefile' option can be used to log messages in a file.  Verbose
messages are not displayed then.  The "-V{filename}" argument can be used to
log startup messages.

":let g:" lists global variables.
":let b:" lists buffer-local variables.
":let w:" lists window-local variables.
":let v:" lists Vim variables.

The stridx() and strridx() functions take a third argument, where to start
searching.  (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The getreg() function takes an extra argument to be able to get the expression
for the '=' register instead of the result of evaluating it.

The setline() function can take a List argument to set multiple lines.  When
the line number is just below the last line the line is appended.

g CTRL-G also shows the number of characters if it differs from the number of
bytes.

Completion for ":debug" and entering an expression for the '=' register.  Skip
":" between range and command name. (Peter winters)

CTRL-Q in Insert mode now works like CTRL-V by default.  Previously it was
ignored.

When "beep" is included in 'debug' a function or script that causes a beep
will result in a message with the source of the error.

When completing buffer names, match with "\(^\|[\/]\)" instead of "^", so that
":buf stor<Tab>" finds both "include/storage.h" and "storage/main.c".

To count items (pattern matches) without changing the buffer the 'n' flag has
been added to |:substitute|.  See |count-items|.

In a |:substitute| command the \u, \U, \l and \L items now also work for
multi-byte characters.

The "screen.linux" $TERM name is recognized to set the default for
'background' to "dark". (Ciaran McCreesh)  Also for "cygwin" and "putty".

The |FileChangedShell| autocommand event can now use the |v:fcs_reason|
variable that specifies what triggered the event.  |v:fcs_choice| can be used
to reload the buffer or ask the user what to do.

Not all modifiers were recognized for xterm function keys.  Added the
possibility in term codes to end in ";*X" or "O*X", where X is any character
and the * stands for the modifier code.
Added the <xUp>, <xDown>, <xLeft> and <xRight> keys, to be able to recognize
the two forms that xterm can send their codes in and still handle all possible
modifiers.

getwinvar() now also works to obtain a buffer-local option from the specified
window.

Added the "%s" item to 'errorformat'. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Added the "%>" item to 'errorformat'.

For 'errorformat' it was not possible to have a file name that contains the
character that follows after "%f".  For example, in "%f:%l:%m" the file name
could not contain ":".  Now include the first ":" where the rest of the
pattern matches.  In the example a ":" not followed by a line number is
included in the file name. (suggested by Emanuele Giaquinta)

GTK GUI: use the GTK file dialog when it's available.  Mix from patches by
Grahame Bowland and Evan Webb.

Added ":scriptnames" to bugreport.vim, so that we can see what plugins were
used.

Win32: If the user changes the setting for the number of lines a scroll wheel
click scrolls it is now used immediately.  Previously Vim would need to be
restarted.

When using @= in an expression the value is expression @= contains.  ":let @=
= value" can be used to set the register contents.

A ! can be added to ":popup" to have the popup menu appear at the mouse
pointer position instead of the text cursor.

The table with encodings has been expanded with many MS-Windows codepages,
such as cp1250 and cp737, so that these can also be used on Unix without
prepending "8bit-".
When an encoding name starts with "microsoft-cp" ignore the "microsoft-" part.

Added the "customlist" completion argument to a user-defined command.  The
user-defined completion function should return the completion candidates as a
Vim List and the returned results are not filtered by Vim. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Win32: Balloons can have multiple lines if common controls supports it.
(Sergey Khorev)

For command-line completion the matches for various types of arguments are now
sorted: user commands, variables, syntax names, etc.

When no locale is set, thus using the "C" locale, Vim will work with latin1
characters, using its own isupper()/toupper()/etc. functions.

When using an rxvt terminal emulator guess the value of 'background' using the
COLORFGBG environment variable. (Ciaran McCreesh)

Also support t_SI and t_EI on Unix with normal features. (Ciaran McCreesh)

When 'foldcolumn' is one then put as much info in it as possible.  This allows
closing a fold with the mouse by clicking on the '-'.

input() takes an optional completion argument to specify the type of
completion supported for the input. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

"dp" works with more than two buffers in diff mode if there is only one where
'modifiable' is set.

The 'diffopt' option has three new values: "horizontal", "vertical" and
"foldcolumn".

When the 'include' option contains \zs the file name found is what is being
matched from \zs to the end or \ze.  Useful to pass more to 'includeexpr'.

Loading plugins on startup now supports subdirectories in the plugin
directory. |load-plugins|

In the foldcolumn always show the '+' for a closed fold, so that it can be
opened easily.  It may overwrite another character, esp. if 'foldcolumn' is 1.

It is now possible to get the W10 message again by setting 'readonly'.  Useful
in the FileChangedRO autocommand when checking out the file fails.

Unix: When open() returns EFBIG give an appropriate message.

":mksession" sets the SessionLoad variable to notify plugins.  A modeline is
added to the session file to set 'filetype' to "vim".

In the ATTENTION prompt put the "Delete it" choice before "Quit" to make it
more logical.  (Robert Webb)

When appending to a file while the buffer has no name the name of the appended
file would be used for the current buffer.  But the buffer contents is
actually different from the file content.  Don't set the file name, unless the
'P' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.

When starting to edit a new file and the directory for the file doesn't exist
then Vim will report "[New DIRECTORY]" instead of "[New File] to give the user
a hint that something might be wrong.

Win32: Preserve the hidden attribute of the viminfo file.

In Insert mode CTRL-A didn't keep the last inserted text when using CTRL-O and
then a cursor key.  Now keep the previously inserted text if nothing is
inserted after the CTRL-O.  Allows using CTRL-O commands to move the cursor
without losing the last inserted text.

The exists() function now supports checking for autocmd group definition
and for supported autocommand events. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Allow using ":global" in the sandbox, it doesn't do anything harmful by
itself.

":saveas asdf.c" will set 'filetype' to c when it's empty.  Also for ":w
asdf.c" when it sets the filename for the buffer.

Insert mode completion for whole lines now also searches unloaded buffers.

The colortest.vim script can now be invoked directly with ":source" or
":runtime syntax/colortest.vim".

The 'statusline' option can be local to the window, so that each window can
have a different value.  (partly by Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The 'statusline' option and other options that support the same format can now
use these new features:
- When it starts with "%!" the value is first evaluated as an expression
  before parsing the value.
- "%#HLname#" can be used to start highlighting with HLname.

When 'statusline' is set to something that causes an error message then it is
made empty to avoid an endless redraw loop.  Also for other options, such at
'tabline' and 'titlestring'.  ":verbose set statusline" will mention that it
was set in an error handler.

When there are several matching tags, the ":tag <name>" and CTRL-] commands
jump to the [count] matching tag. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: In the batch files generated by the install program, use $VIMRUNTIME or
$VIM if it's set.  Example provided by Mathias Michaelis.
Also create a vimtutor.bat batch file.

The 'balloonexpr' option is now |global-local|.

The system() function now runs in cooked mode, thus can be interrupted by
CTRL-C.

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-7*

Dropped the support for the BeOS and Amiga GUI.  They were not maintained and
probably didn't work.  If you want to work on this: get the Vim 6.x version
and merge it back in.

When running the tests and one of them fails to produce "test.out" the
following tests are still executed.  This helps when running out of memory.

When compiling with EXITFREE defined and the ccmalloc library, it is possible
to detect memory leaks.  Some memory will always be reported as leaked, such
as allocated by X11 library functions and the memory allocated in
alloc_cmdbuff() to store the ":quit" command.

Moved the code for printing to src/hardcopy.c.

Moved some code from main() to separate functions to make it easier to see
what is being done.  Using a structure to avoid a lot of arguments to the
functions.

Moved unix_expandpath() to misc1.c, so that it can also be used by os_mac.c
without copying the code.

--- Mac ---

"make" now creates the Vim.app directory and "make install" copies it to its
final destination. (Raf)

Put the runtime directory not directly in Vim.app but in
Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim, so that it's according to Mac specs.

Made it possible to compile with Motif, Athena or GTK without tricks and still
being able to use the MacRoman conversion.  Added the os_mac_conv.c file.

When running "make install" the runtime files are installed as for Unix.
Avoids that too many files are copied.  When running "make" a link to the
runtime files is created to avoid a recursive copy that takes much time.

Configure will attempt to build Vim for both Intel and PowerPC.  The
--with-mac-arch configure argument can change it.

--- Win32 ---

The Make_mvc.mak file was adjusted to work with the latest MS compilers,
including the free version of Visual Studio 2005. (George Reilly)

INSTALLpc.txt was updated for the recent changes. (George Reilly)

The distributed executable is now produced with the free Visual C++ Toolkit
2003 and other free SDK chunks.  msvcsetup.bat was added to support this.

Also generate the .pdb file that can be used to generate a useful crash report
on MS-Windows. (George Reilly)

==============================================================================
BUG FIXES						*bug-fixes-7*

When using PostScript printing on MS-DOS the default 'printexpr' used "lpr"
instead of "copy".  When 'printdevice' was empty the copy command did not
work.  Use "LPT1" then.

The GTK font dialog uses a font size zero when the font name doesn't include a
size.  Use a default size of 10.

This example in the documentation didn't work:
    :e `=foo . ".c"`
Skip over the expression in `=expr` when looking for comments, |, % and #.

When ":helpgrep" doesn't find anything there is no error message.

"L" and "H" did not take closed folds into account.

Win32: The "-P title" argument stopped at the first title that matched, even
when it doesn't support MDI.

Mac GUI: CTRL-^ and CTRL-@ did not work.

"2daw" on "word." at the end of a line didn't include the preceding white
space.

Win32: Using FindExecutable() doesn't work to find a program.  Use
SearchPath() instead.  For executable() use $PATHEXT when the program searched
for doesn't have an extension.

When 'virtualedit' is set, moving the cursor up after appending a character
may move it to a different column.  Was caused by auto-formatting moving the
cursor and not putting it back where it was.

When indent was added automatically and then moving the cursor, the indent was
not deleted (like when pressing ESC).  The "I" flag in 'cpoptions' can be used
to make it work the old way.

When opening a command-line window, 'textwidth' gets set to 78 by the Vim
filetype plugin.  Reset 'textwidth' to 0 to avoid lines are broken.

After using cursor(line, col) moving up/down doesn't keep the same column.

Win32: Borland C before 5.5 requires using ".u." for LowPart and HighPart
fields. (Walter Briscoe)

On Sinix SYS_NMLN isn't always defined.  Define it ourselves. (Cristiano De
Michele)

Printing with PostScript may keep the printer waiting for more.  Append a
CTRL-D to the printer output. (Mike Williams)

When converting a string with a hex or octal number the leading '-' was
ignored.  ":echo '-05' + 0" resulted in 5 instead of -5.

Using "@:" to repeat a command line didn't work when it contains control
characters.  Also remove "'<,'>" when in Visual mode to avoid that it appears
twice.

When using file completion for a user command, it would not expand environment
variables like for a regular command with a file argument.

'cindent': When the argument of a #define looks like a C++ class the next line
is indented too much.

When 'comments' includes multi-byte characters inserting the middle part and
alignment may go wrong.  'cindent' also suffers from this for right-aligned
items.

Win32: when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" getenv() still returns strings in the
active codepage.  Convert to utf-8.  Also for $HOME.

The default for 'helplang' was "zh" for both "zh_cn" and "zh_tw".  Now use
"cn" or "tw" as intended.

When 'bin' is set and 'eol' is not set then line2byte() added the line break
after the last line while it's not there.

Using foldlevel() in a WinEnter autocommand may not work.  Noticed when
resizing the GUI shell upon startup.

Python: Using buffer.append(f.readlines()) didn't work.  Allow appending a
string with a trailing newline.  The newline is ignored.

When using the ":saveas f2" command for buffer "f1", the Buffers menu would
contain "f2" twice, one of them leading to "f1".  Also trigger the BufFilePre
and BufFilePost events for the alternate buffer that gets the old name.

strridx() did not work well when the needle is empty. (Ciaran McCreesh)

GTK: Avoid a potential hang in gui_mch_wait_for_chars() when input arrives
just before it is invoked

VMS: Occasionally CR characters were inserted in the file.  Expansion of
environment variables was not correct. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

UTF-8: When 'delcombine' is set "dw" only deleted the last combining character
from the first character of the word.

When using ":sball" in an autocommand only the filetype in one buffer was
detected.  Reset did_filetype in enter_buffer().

When using ":argdo" and the window already was at the first argument index,
but not actually editing it, the current buffer would be used instead.

When ":next dir/*" includes many matches, adding the names to the argument
list may take an awful lot of time and can't be interrupted.  Allow
interrupting this.

When editing a file that was already loaded in a buffer, modelines were not
used.  Now window-local options in the modeline are set.  Buffer-local options
and global options remain unmodified.

Win32: When 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" in the vimrc file, files from the
command line with non-ASCII characters are not used correctly.  Recode the
file names when 'encoding' is set, using the Unicode command line.

Win32 console: When the default for 'encoding' ends up to be "latin1", the
default value of 'isprint' was wrong.

When an error message is given while waiting for a character (e.g., when an
xterm reports the number of colors), the hit-enter prompt overwrote the last
line.  Don't reset msg_didout in normal_cmd() for K_IGNORE.

Mac GUI: Shift-Tab didn't work.

When defining tooltip text, don't translate terminal codes, since it's not
going to be used like a command.

GTK 2: Check the tooltip text for valid utf-8 characters to avoid getting a
GTK error.  Invalid characters may appear when 'encoding' is changed.

GTK 2: Add a safety check for invalid utf-8 sequences, they can crash pango.

Win32: When 'encoding' is changed while starting up, use the Unicode command
line to convert the file arguments to 'encoding'.  Both for the GUI and the
console version.

Win32 GUI: latin9 text (iso-8859-15) was not displayed correctly, because
there is no codepage for latin9.  Do our own conversion from latin9 to UCS2.

When two versions of GTK+ 2 are installed it was possible to use the header
files from one and the library from the other.  Use GTK_LIBDIR to put the
directory for the library early in the link flags.

With the GUI find/replace dialog a replace only worked if the pattern was
literal text.  Now it works for any pattern.

When 'equalalways' is set and 'eadirection' is "hor", ":quit" would still
cause equalizing window heights in the vertical direction.

When ":emenu" is used in a startup script the command was put in the typeahead
buffer, causing a prompt for the crypt key to be messed up.

Mac OS/X: The default for 'isprint' included characters 128-160, causes
problems for Terminal.app.

When a syntax item with "containedin" is used, it may match in the start or
end of a region with a matchgroup, while this doesn't happen for a "contains"
argument.

When a transparent syntax items matches in another item where the highlighting
has already stopped (because of a he= argument), the highlighting would come
back.

When cscope is used to set the quickfix error list, it didn't get set if there
was only one match. (Sergey Khorev)

When 'confirm' is set and using ":bdel" in a modified buffer, then selecting
"cancel", would still give an error message.

The PopUp menu items that started Visual mode didn't work when not in Normal
mode.  Switching between selecting a word and a line was not possible.

Win32: The keypad decimal point always resulted in a '.', while on some
keyboards it's a ','.  Use MapVirtualKey(VK_DECIMAL, 2).

Removed unused function DisplayCompStringOpaque() from gui_w32.c

In Visual mode there is not always an indication whether the line break is
selected or not.  Highlight the character after the line when the line break
is included, e.g., after "v$o".

GTK: The <F10> key can't be mapped, it selects the menu.  Disable that with a
GTK setting and do select the menu when <F10> isn't mapped. (David Necas)

After "Y" '[ and '] were not at start/end of the yanked text.

When a telnet connection is dropped Vim preserves files and exits.  While
doing that a SIGHUP may arrive and disturb us, thus ignore it. (Scott
Anderson)  Also postpone SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM until it's safe to
handle.  Added handle_signal().

When completing a file name on the command line backslashes are required for
white space.  Was only done for a space, not for a Tab.

When configure could not find a terminal library, compiling continued for a
long time before reporting the problem.  Added a configure check for tgetent()
being found in a library.

When the cursor is on the first char of the last line a ":g/pat/s///" command
may cause the cursor to be displayed below the text.

Win32: Editing a file with non-ASCII characters doesn't work when 'encoding'
is "utf-8".  use _wfullpath() instead of _fullpath(). (Yu-sung Moon)

When recovering the 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' were taken from the
original file instead of from the swapfile.  When the file didn't exist, was
empty or the option was changed (e.g., with ":e ++fenc=cp123 file") it could
be wrong.  Now store 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' in the swapfile and use
the values when recovering.

":bufdo g/something/p" overwrites each last printed text line with the file
message for the next buffer.  Temporarily clear 'shortmess' to avoid that.

Win32: Cannot edit a file starting with # with --remote.  Do escape % and #
when building the ":drop" command.

A comment or | just after an expression-backtick argument was not recognized.
E.g. in :e `="foo"`"comment.

"(" does not stop at an empty sentence (single dot and white space) while ")"
does.  Also breaks "das" on that dot.

When doing "yy" with the cursor on a TAB the ruler could be wrong and "k"
moved the cursor to another column.

When 'commentstring' is '"%s' and there is a double quote in the line a double
quote before the fold marker isn't removed in the text displayed for a  closed
fold.

In Visual mode, when 'bin' and 'eol' set, g CTRL-G counted the last line
break, resulting in "selected 202 of 201 bytes".

Motif: fonts were not used for dialog components. (Marcin Dalecki)

Motif: After using a toolbar button the keyboard focus would be on the toolbar
(Lesstif problem). (Marcin Dalecki)

When using "y<C-V>`x" where mark x is in the first column, the last line was
not included.

Not all test scripts work properly on MS-Windows when checked out from CVS.
Use a Vim command to fix all fileformats to dos before executing the tests.

When using ":new" and the file fits in the window, lines could still be above
the window.  Now remove empty lines instead of keeping the relative position.

Cmdline completion didn't work after ":let var1 var<Tab>".

When using ":startinsert" or ":startreplace" when already in Insert mode
(possible when using CTRL-R =), pressing Esc would directly restart Insert
mode. (Peter Winters)

"2daw" didn't work at end of file if the last word is a single character.

Completion for ":next a'<Tab>" put a backslash before single quote, but it was
not removed when editing a file.  Now halve backslashes in save_patterns().
Also fix expanding a file name with the shell that contains "\'".

When doing "1,6d|put" only "fewer lines" was reported.  Now a following "more
lines" overwrites the message.

Configure could not handle "-Dfoo=long\ long" in the TCL config output.

When searching backwards, using a pattern that matches a newline and uses \zs
after that, didn't find a match.  Could also get a hang or end up in the right
column in the wrong line.

When $LANG is "sl" for slovenian, the slovak menu was used, since "slovak"
starts with "sl".

When 'paste' is set in the GUI the Paste toolbar button doesn't work.  Clear
'paste' when starting the GUI.

A message about a wrong viminfo line included the trailing NL.

When 'paste' is set in the GUI the toolbar button doesn't work in Insert mode.
Use ":exe" in menu.vim to avoid duplicating the commands, instead of using a
mapping.

Treat "mlterm" as an xterm-like terminal. (Seiichi Sato)

":z.4" and ":z=4" didn't work Vi compatible.

When sourcing a file, editing it and sourcing it again, it could appear twice
in ":scriptnames" and get a new <SID>, because the inode has changed.

When $SHELL is set but empty the 'shell' option would be empty.  Don't use an
empty $SHELL value.

A command "w! file" in .vimrc or $EXINIT didn't work.  Now it writes an empty
file.

When a CTRL-F command at the end of the file failed, the cursor was still
moved to the start of the line.  Now it remains where it is.

When using ":s" or "&" to repeat the last substitute and "$" was used to put
the cursor in the last column, put the cursor in the last column again.  This
is Vi compatible.

Vim is not fully POSIX compliant but sticks with traditional Vi behavior.
Added a few flags in 'cpoptions' to behave the POSIX way when wanted.  The
$VIM_POSIX environment variable is checked to set the default.

Appending to a register didn't insert a line break like Vi.  Added the '>'
flag to 'cpoptions' for this.

Using "I" in a line with only blanks appended to the line.  This is not Vi
compatible.  Added the 'H' flag in 'coptions' for this.

When joining multiple lines the cursor would be at the last joint, but Vi
leaves it at the position where "J" would put it.  Added the 'q' flag in
'cpoptions' for this.

Autoindent didn't work for ":insert" and ":append".

Using ":append" in an empty buffer kept the dummy line.  Now it's deleted to
be Vi compatible.

When reading commands from a file and stdout goes to a terminal, would still
request the xterm version.  Vim can't read it, thus the output went to the
shell and caused trouble there.

When redirecting to a register with an invalid name the redirection would
still be done (after an error message).  Now reset "redir_reg". (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

It was not possible to use a NL after a backslash in Ex mode.  This is
sometimes used to feed multiple lines to a shell command.

When 'cmdheight' is set to 2 in .vimrc and the GUI uses the number of lines
from the terminal we actually get 3 lines for the cmdline in gvim.

When setting $HOME allocated memory would leak.

Win32: bold characters may sometimes write in another character cell.  Use
unicodepdy[] as for UTF-8. (Taro Muraoka)

":w fname" didn't work for files with 'buftype' set to "nofile".

The method used to locate user commands for completion differed from when they
are executed.  Ambiguous command names were not completed properly.

Incremental search may cause a crash when there is a custom statusline that
indirectly invokes ":normal".

Diff mode failed when $DIFF_OPTIONS was set in the environment.  Unset it
before invoking "diff".

Completion didn't work after ":argdo", ":windo" and ":bufdo".  Also for ":set
&l:opt" and ":set &g:opt". (Peter Winters)

When setting 'ttymouse' to "dec" in an xterm that supports the DEC mouse
locator it doesn't work.  Now switch off the mouse before selecting another
mouse model.

When the CursorHold event is triggered and the commands peek for typed
characters the typeahead buffer may be messed up, e.g., when a mouse-up event
is received.  Avoid invoking the autocommands from the function waiting for a
character, let it put K_CURSORHOLD in the input buffer.

Removed the "COUNT" flag from ":argadd", to avoid ":argadd 1*" to be used like
":1argadd *".  Same for ":argdelete" and ":argedit".

Avoid that $LANG is used for the menus when LC_MESSAGES is "en_US".

Added backslashes before dashes in the vim.1 manual page to make them appear
as real dashes. (Pierre Habouzit)

Where "gq" left the cursor depended on the value of 'formatprg'.  Now "gq"
always leaves the cursor at the last line of the formatted text.

When editing a compressed file, such as "changelog.Debian.gz" file, filetype
detection may try to check the contents of the file while it's still
compressed.  Skip setting 'filetype' for compressed files until they have been
decompressed.  Required for patterns that end in a "*".

Starting with an argument "+cmd" or "-S script" causes the cursor to be moved
to the first line.  That breaks a BufReadPost autocommand that uses g`".
Don't move the cursor if it's somewhere past the first line.

"gg=G" while 'modifiable' is off was uninterruptible.

When 'encoding' is "sjis" inserting CTRL-V u d800 a few times causes a crash.
Don't insert a DBCS character with a NUL second byte.

In Insert mode CTRL-O <Home> didn't move the cursor.  Made "ins_at_eol" global
and reset it in nv_home().

Wildcard expansion failed: ":w /tmp/$$.`echo test`".  Don't put quotes around
spaces inside backticks.

After this sequence of commands: Y V p gv: the wrong line is selected.  Now
let "gv" select the text that was put, since the original text is deleted.
This should be the most useful thing to do.

":sleep 100u" sleeps for 100 seconds, not 100 usec as one might expect.  Give
an error message when the argument isn't recognized.

In gui_mch_draw_string() in gui_w32.c "unibuflen" wasn't static, resulting in
reallocating the buffer every time. (Alexei Alexandrov)

When using a Python "atexit" function it was not invoked when Vim exits.  Now
call Py_Finalize() for that. (Ugo Di Girolamo)
This breaks the thread stuff though, fixed by Ugo.

GTK GUI: using a .vimrc with "set cmdheight=2 lines=43" and ":split" right
after startup, the window layout is messed up. (Michael Schaap)  Added
win_new_shellsize() call in gui_init() to fix the topframe size.

Trick to get ...MOUSE_NM not used when there are vertical splits.  Now pass
column -1 for the left most window and add MOUSE_COLOFF for others.  Limits
mouse column to 10000.

searchpair() may hang when the end pattern has "\zs" at the end.  Check that
we find the same position again and advance one character.

When in diff mode and making a change that causes the "changed" highlighting
to disappear or reappear, it was still highlighted in another window.

When a ":next" command fails because the user selects "Abort" at the ATTENTION
prompt the argument index was advanced anyway.

When "~" is in 'iskeyword' the "gd" doesn't work, it's used for the previous
substitute pattern.  Put "\V" in the pattern to avoid that.

Use of sprintf() sometimes didn't check properly for buffer overflow.  Also
when using smsg().  Included code for snprintf() to avoid having to do size
checks where invoking them

":help \=<Tab>" didn't find "sub-replace-\=".  Wild menu for help tags didn't
show backslashes.  ":he :s\=" didn't work.

When reading an errorfile "~/" in a file name was not expanded.

GTK GUI: When adding a scrollbar (e.g. when using ":vsplit") in a script or
removing it the window size may change.  GTK sends us resize events when we
change the window size ourselves, but they may come at an unexpected moment.
Peek for a character to get any window resize events and fix 'columns' and
'lines' to undo this.

When using the GTK plug mechanism, resizing and focus was not working
properly. (Neil Bird)

After deleting files from the argument list a session file generated with
":mksession" may contain invalid ":next" commands.

When 'shortmess' is empty and 'keymap' set to accents, in Insert mode CTRL-N
may cause the hit-enter prompt.  Typing 'a then didn't result in the accented
character.  Put the character typed at the prompt back in the typeahead buffer
so that mapping is done in the right mode.

setbufvar() and setwinvar() did not give error messages.

It was possible to set a variable with an illegal name, e.g. with setbufvar().
It was possible to define a function with illegal name, e.t. ":func F{-1}()"

CTRL-W F and "gf" didn't use the same method to get the file name.

When reporting a conversion error the line number of the last error could be
given.  Now report the first encountered error.

When using ":e ++enc=name file" and iconv() was used for conversion an error
caused a fall-back to no conversion.  Now replace a character with '?' and
continue.

When opening a new buffer the local value of 'bomb' was not initialized from
the global value.

Win32: When using the "Edit with Vim" entry the file name was limited to about
200 characters.

When using command line completion for ":e *foo" and the file "+foo" exists
the resulting command ":e +foo" doesn't work.  Now insert a backslash: ":e
\+foo".

When the translation of "-- More --" was not 10 characters long the following
message would be in the wrong position.

At the more-prompt the last character in the last line wasn't drawn.

When deleting non-existing text while 'virtualedit' is set the '[ and '] marks
were not set.

Win32: Could not use "**/" in 'path', it had to be "**\".

The search pattern "\n" did not match at the end of the last line.

Searching for a pattern backwards, starting on the NUL at the end of the line
and 'encoding' is "utf-8" would match the pattern just before it incorrectly.
Affected searchpair('/\*', '', '\*/').

For the Find/Replace dialog it was possible that not finding the text resulted
in an error message while redrawing, which cleared the syntax highlighting
while it was being used, resulting in a crash.  Now don't clear syntax
highlighting, disable it with b_syn_error.

Win32: Combining UTF-8 characters were drawn on the previous character.
Could be noticed with a Thai font.

Output of ":function" could leave some of the typed text behind. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

When the command line history has only a few lines the command line window
would be opened with these lines above the first window line.

When using a command line window for search strings ":qa" would result in
searching for "qa" instead of quitting all windows.

GUI: When scrolling with the scrollbar and there is a line that doesn't fit
redrawing may fail.  Make sure w_skipcol is valid before redrawing.

Limit the values of 'columns' and 'lines' to avoid an overflow in Rows *
Columns.  Fixed bad effects when running out of memory (command line would be
reversed, ":qa!" resulted in ":!aq").

Motif: "gvim -iconic" opened the window anyway.  (David Harrison)

There is a tiny chance that a symlink gets created between checking for an
existing file and creating a file.  Use the O_NOFOLLOW for open() if it's
available.

In an empty line "ix<CTRL-O>0" moved the cursor to after the line instead of
sticking to the first column.

When using ":wq" and a BufWriteCmd autocmd uses inputsecret() the text was
echoed anyway.  Set terminal to raw mode in getcmdline().

Unix: ":w a;b~c" caused an error in expanding wildcards.

When appending to a file with ":w >>fname" in a buffer without a name, causing
the buffer to use "fname", the modified flag was reset.

When appending to the current file the "not edited" flag would be reset.
":w" would overwrite the file accidentally.

Unix: When filtering text with an external command Vim would still read input,
causing text typed for the command (e.g., a password) to be eaten and echoed.
Don't read input when the terminal is in cooked mode.

The Cygwin version of xxd used CR/LF line separators. (Corinna Vinschen)

Unix: When filtering text through a shell command some resulting text may be
dropped.  Now after detecting that the child has exited try reading some more
of its output.

When inside input(), using "CTRL-R =" and the expression throws an exception
the command line was not abandoned but it wasn't used either.  Now abandon
typing the command line.

'delcombine' was also used in Visual and Select mode and for commands like
"cl".  That was illogical and has been disabled.

When recording while a CursorHold autocommand was defined special keys would
appear in the register.  Now the CursorHold event is not triggered while
recording.

Unix: the src/configure script used ${srcdir-.}, not all shells understand
that.  Use ${srcdir:-.} instead.

When editing file "a" which is a symlink to file "b" that doesn't exist,
writing file "a" to create "b" and then ":split b" resulted in two buffers on
the same file with two different swapfile names.  Now set the inode in the
buffer when creating a new file.

When 'esckeys' is not set don't send the xterm code to request the version
string, because it may cause trouble in Insert mode.

When evaluating an expression for CTRL-R = on the command line it was possible
to call a function that opens a new window, resulting in errors for
incremental search, and many other nasty things were possible.  Now use the
|textlock| to disallow changing the buffer or jumping to another window
to protect from unexpected behavior.  Same for CTRL-\ e.

"d(" deleted the character under the cursor, while the documentation specified
an exclusive motion.  Vi also doesn't delete the character under the cursor.

Shift-Insert in Insert mode could put the cursor before the last character
when it just fits in the window.  In coladvance() don't stop at the window
edge when filling with spaces and when in Insert mode.  In mswin.vim avoid
getting a beep from the "l" command.

Win32 GUI: When Alt-F4 is used to close the window and Cancel is selected in
the dialog then Vim would insert <M-F4> in the text.  Now it's ignored.

When ":silent! {cmd}" caused the swap file dialog, which isn't displayed,
there would still be a hit-enter prompt.

Requesting the termresponse (|t_RV|) early may cause problems with "-c"
arguments that invoke an external command or even "-c quit".  Postpone it
until after executing "-c" arguments.

When typing in Insert mode so that a new line is started, using CTRL-G u to
break undo and start a new change, then joining the lines with <BS> caused
undo info to be missing.  Now reset the insertion start point.

Syntax HL: When a region start match has a matchgroup and an offset that
happens to be after the end of the line then it continued in the next line and
stopped at the region end match, making the region continue after that.
Now check for the column being past the end of the line in syn_add_end_off().

When changing a file, setting 'swapfile' off and then on again, making another
change and killing Vim, then some blocks may be missing from the swapfile.
When 'swapfile' is switched back on mark all blocks in the swapfile as dirty.
Added mf_set_dirty().

Expanding wildcards in a command like ":e aap;<>!" didn't work.  Put
backslashes before characters that are special to the shell. (Adri Verhoef)

A CursorHold autocommand would cause a message to be cleared.  Don't show the
special key for the event for 'showcmd'.

When expanding a file name for a shell command, as in "!cmd foo<Tab>" or ":r
!cmd foo<Tab>" also escape characters that are special for the shell:
"!;&()<>".

When the name of the buffer was set by a ":r fname" command |cpo-f| no
autocommands were triggered to notify about the change in the buffer list.

In the quickfix buffer 'bufhidden' was set to "delete", which caused closing
the quickfix window to leave an unlisted "No Name" buffer behind every time.

Win32: when using two screens of different size, setting 'lines' to a large
value didn't fill the whole screen. (SungHyun Nam)

Win32 installer: The generated _vimrc contained an absolute path to diff.exe.
After upgrading it becomes invalid.  Now use $VIMRUNTIME instead.

The command line was cleared to often when 'showmode' was set and ":silent
normal vy" was used.  Don't clear the command line unless the mode was
actually displayed.  Added the "mode_displayed" variable.

The "load session" toolbar item could not handle a space or other special
characters in v:this_session.

":set sta ts=8 sw=4 sts=2" deleted 4 spaces halfway a line instead of 2.

In a multi-byte file the foldmarker could be recognized in the trail byte.
(Taro Muraoka)

Pasting with CTRL-V and menu didn't work properly when some commands are
mapped.  Use ":normal!" instead of ":normal". (Tony Apuzzo)

Crashed when expanding a file name argument in backticks.

In some situations the menu and scrollbar didn't work, when the value contains
a CSI byte. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

GTK GUI: When drawing the balloon focus changes and we might get a key release
event that removed the balloon again.  Ignore the key release event.

'titleold' was included in ":mkexrc" and ":mksession" files.

":set background&" didn't use the same logic as was used when starting up.

When "umask" is set such that nothing is writable then the viminfo file would
be written without write permission. (Julian Bridle)

Motif: In diff mode dragging one scrollbar didn't update the scrollbar of the
other diff'ed window.

When editing in an xterm with a different number of colors than expected the
screen would be cleared and redrawn, causing the message about the edited file
to be cleared.  Now set "keep_msg" to redraw the last message.

For a color terminal: When the Normal HL uses bold, possibly to make the color
lighter, and another HL group specifies a color it might become light as well.
Now reset bold if a HL group doesn't specify bold itself.

When using 256 color xterm the color 255 would show up as color 0.  Use a
short instead of a char to store the color number.

ml_get errors when searching for "\n\zs" in an empty file.

When selecting a block and using "$" to select until the end of every line and
not highlighting the character under the cursor the first character of the
block could be unhighlighted.

When counting words for the Visual block area and using "$" to select until
the end of every line only up to the length of the last line was counted.

"dip" in trailing empty lines left one empty line behind.

The script ID was only remembered globally for each option. When a buffer- or
window-local option was set the same "last set" location was changed for all
buffers and windows.  Now remember the script ID for each local option
separately.

GUI: The "Replace All" button didn't handle backslashes in the replacement in
the same way as "Replace".  Escape backslashes so that they are taken
literally.

When using Select mode from Insert mode and typing a key, causing lines to be
deleted and a message displayed, delayed the effect of inserting the key.
Now overwrite the message without delay.

When 'whichwrap' includes "l" then "dl" and "yl" on a single letter line
worked differently.  Now recognize all operators when using "l" at the end of
a line.

GTK GUI: when the font selector returned a font name with a comma in it then
it would be handled like two font names.  Now put a backslash before the
comma.

MS-DOS, Win32: When 'encoding' defaults to "latin1" then the value for
'iskeyword' was still for CPxxx.  And when 'nocompatible' was set 'isprint'
would also be the wrong value.

When a command was defined not to take arguments and no '|' no warning message
would be given for using a '|'.  Also with ":loadkeymap".

Motif: When using a fontset and 'encoding' is "utf-8" and sizeof(wchar_t) !=
sizeof(XChar2b) then display was wrong. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":all" always set the current window to the first window, even when it
contains a buffer that is not in the argument list (can't be closed because it
is modified).  Now go to the window that has the first item of the argument
list.

GUI: To avoid left-over pixels from bold text all characters after a character
with special attributes were redrawn.  Now only do this for characters that
actually are bold.  Speeds up displaying considerably.

When only highlighting changes and the text is scrolled at the same time
everything is redrawn instead of using a scroll and updating the changed text.
E.g., when using ":match" to highlight a paren that the cursor landed on.
Added SOME_VALID: Redraw the whole window but also try to scroll to minimize
redrawing.

Win32: When using Korean IME making it active didn't work properly. (Moon,
Yu-sung, 2005 March 21)

Ruby interface: when inserting/deleting lines display wasn't updated. (Ryan
Paul)

--- fixes since Vim 7.0b ---

Getting the GCC version in configure didn't work with Solaris sed.  First
strip any "darwin." and then get the version number.

The "autoload" directory was missing from the self-installing executable for
MS-Windows.

The MS-Windows install program would find "vimtutor.bat" in the install
directory.  After changing to "c:" also change to "\" to avoid looking in the
install directory.

To make the 16 bit DOS version compile exclude not used highlight
initializations and build a tiny instead of small version.

finddir() and findfile() accept a negative count and return a List then.

The Python indent file contained a few debugging statements, removed.

Expanding {} for a function name, resulting in a name starting with "s:" was
not handled correctly.

Spelling: renamed COMPOUNDMAX to COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Added several items to be
able to handle the new Hungarian dictionary.

Mac: Default to building for the current platform only, that is much faster
than building a universal binary.  Also, using Perl/Python/etc. only works for
the current platform.

The time on undo messages disappeared for someone.  Using %T for strftime()
apparently doesn't work everywhere.  Use %H:%M:%S instead.

Typing BS at the "z=" prompt removed the prompt.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0c ---

When jumping to another tab page the Vim window size was always set, even when
nothing in the layout changed.

Win32 GUI tab pages line wasn't always enabled.  Do a proper check for the
compiler version.

Win32: When switching between tab pages the Vim window was moved when part of
it was outside of the screen.  Now only do that in the direction of a size
change.

Win32: added menu to GUI tab pages line. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Mac: Added document icons. (Benji Fisher)

Insert mode completion: Using Enter to accept the current match causes
confusion.  Use CTRL-Y instead.  Also, use CTRL-E to go back to the typed
text.

GUI: When there are left and right scrollbars, ":tabedit" kept them instead of
using the one that isn't needed.

Using "gP" to replace al the text could leave the cursor below the last line,
causing ml_get errors.

When 'cursorline' is set don't use the highlighting when Visual mode is
active, otherwise it's difficult to see the selected area.

The matchparen plugin restricts the search to 100 lines, to avoid a long delay
when there are closed folds.

Sometimes using CTRL-X s to list spelling suggestions used text from another
line.

Win32: Set the default for 'isprint' back to the wrong default "@,~-255",
because many people use Windows-1252 while 'encoding' is "latin1".

GTK: Added a workaround for gvim crashing when used over an untrusted ssh
link, caused by GTK doing something nasty. (Ed Catmur)

Win32: The font used for the tab page labels is too big.  Use the system menu
font. (George Reilly)

Win32: Adjusting the window position and size to keep it on the screen didn't
work properly when the taskbar is on the left or top of the screen.

The installman.sh and installml.sh scripts use ${10}, that didn't work with
old shells.  And use "test -f" instead of "test -e".

Win32: When 'encoding' was set in the vimrc then a directory argument for diff
mode didn't work.

GUI: at the inputlist() prompt the cursorshape was adjusted as if the windows
were still at their old position.

The parenmatch plugin didn't remember the highlighting per window.

Using ":bd" for a buffer that's the current window in another tab page caused
a crash.

For a new tab page the 'scroll' option wasn't set to a good default.

Using an end offset for a search "/pat/e" didn't work properly for multi-byte
text. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":s/\n/,/" doubled the text when used on the last line.

When "search" is in 'foldopen' "[s" and "]s" now open folds.

When using a numbered function "dict" can be omitted, but "self" didn't work
then.  Always add FC_DICT to the function flags when it's part of a
dictionary.

When "--remote-tab" executes locally it left an empty tab page.

"gvim -u NONE", ":set cursorcolumn", "C" in the second line didn't update
text.  Do update further lines even though the "$" is displayed.

VMS: Support GTK better, also enable +clientserver. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When highlighting of statusline or tabline is changed there was no redraw to
show the effect.

Mac: Added "CFBundleIdentifier" to infplist.xml.

Added tabpage-local variables t:var.

Win32: Added double-click in tab pages line creates new tab. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Motif: Added GUI tab pages line. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Fixed crash when 'lines' was set to 1000 in a modeline.

When init_spellfile() finds a writable directory in 'runtimepath' but it
doesn't contain a "spell" directory, create one.

Win32: executable() also finds "xxd" in the directory where Vim was started,
but "!xxd" doesn't work.  Append the Vim starting directory to $PATH.

The tab page labels are shortened, directory names are reduced to a single
letter by default.  Added the pathshorten() function to allow a user to do the
same.

":saveas" now resets 'readonly' if the file was successfully written.

Set $MYVIMRC file to the first found .vimrc file.
Set $MYGVIMRC file to the first found .gvimrc file.
Added menu item "Startup Settings" that edits the $MYVIMRC file

Added matcharg().

Error message E745 appeared twice.  Renamed one to E786.

Fixed crash when using "au BufRead * Sexplore" and doing ":help".  Was wiping
out a buffer that's still in a window.

":hardcopy" resulted in an error message when 'encoding' is "utf-8" and
'printencoding' is empty.  Now it assumes latin1. (Mike Williams)

The check for the toolbar feature for Motif, depending on certain included
files, wasn't detailed enough, causing building to fail in gui_xmebw.c.

Using CTRL-E in Insert mode completion after CTRL-P inserted the first match
instead of the original text.

When displaying a UTF-8 character with a zero lower byte Vim might think the
previous character is double-wide.

The "nbsp" item of 'listchars' didn't work when 'encoding' was utf-8.

Motif: when Xm/xpm.h is missing gui_xmebw.c would not compile.
HAVE_XM_UNHIGHLIGHTT_H was missing a T.

Mac: Moved the .icns files into src/os_mac_rsrc, so that they can all be
copied at once.  Adjusted the Info.plist file for three icons.

When Visual mode is active while switching to another tabpage could get ml_get
errors.

When 'list' is set, 'nowrap' the $ in the first column caused 'cursorcolumn'
to move to the right.

When a line wraps, 'cursorcolumn' was never displayed past the end of the
line.

'autochdir' was only available when compiled with NetBeans and GUI.  Now it's
a separate feature, also available in the "big" version.

Added CTRL-W gf: open file under cursor in new tab page.

When using the menu in the tab pages line, "New Tab" opens the new tab before
where the click was.  Beyond the labels the new tab appears at the end instead
of after the current tab page.

Inside a mapping with an expression getchar() could not be used.

When vgetc is used recursively vgetc_busy protects it from being used
recursively.  But after a ":normal" command the protection was reset.

":s/a/b/n" didn't work when 'modifiable' was off.

When $VIMRUNTIME includes a multi-byte character then rgb.txt could not be
found. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":mkspell" didn't work correctly for non-ASCII affix flags when conversion is
needed on the spell file.

glob('/dir/\$ABC/*') didn't work.

When using several tab pages and changing 'cmdheight' the display could become
messed up.  Now store the value of 'cmdheight' separately for each tab page.

The user of the Enter key while the popup menu is visible was still confusing.
Now use Enter to select the match after using a cursor key.

Added "usetab" to 'switchbuf'.


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0d ---

Added CTRL-W T: move a window to a new tab page.

Using CTRL-X s in Insert mode to complete spelling suggestions and using BS
deleted characters before the bad word.

A few small fixes for the VMS makefile. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

With a window of 91 lines 45 cols, ":vsp" scrolled the window.  Copy w_wrow
when splitting a window and skip setting the height when it's already at the
right value.

Using <silent> in a mapping with a shell command and the GUI caused redraw
to use wrong attributes.

Win32: Using MSVC 4.1 for install.exe resulted in the start menu items to be
created in the administrator directory instead of "All Users".  Define the
CSIDL_ items if they are missing.

Motif: The GUI tabline did not use the space above the right scrollbar.  Work
around a bug in the Motif library. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The extra files for XML Omni completion are now also installed.
|xml-omni-datafile|

GTK GUI: when 'm' is missing from 'guioptions' during startup and pressing
<F10> GTK produced error messages.  Now do create the menu but disable it just
after the first gui_mch_update().

":mkspell" doesn't work well with the Hungarian dictionary from the Hunspell
project.  Back to the Myspell dictionary.

In help files hide the | used around tags.

Renamed pycomplete to pythoncomplete.

Added "tabpages" to 'sessionoptions'.

When 'guitablabel' is set the effect wasn't visible right away.

Fixed a few 'cindent' errors.

When completing menu names, e.g., after ":emenu", don't sort the entries but
keep them in the original order.

Fixed a crash when editing a directory in diff mode.  Don't trigger
autocommands when executing the diff command.

Getting a keystroke could get stuck if 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding and
typing a special key.

When 'foldignore' is set the folds were not updated right away.

When a list is indexed with [a : b] and b was greater than the length an error
message was given.  Now silently truncate the result.

When using BS during Insert mode completion go back to the original text, so
that CTRL-N selects the first matching entry.

Added the 'M' flag to 'cinoptions'.

Win32: Make the "gvim --help" window appear in the middle of the screen
instead of at an arbitrary position. (Randall W. Morris)

Added gettabwinvar() and settabwinvar().

Command line completion: pressing <Tab> after ":e /usr/*" expands the whole
tree, because it becomes ":e /usr/**".  Don't add a star if there already is
one.

Added grey10 to grey90 to all GUIs, so that they can all be used for
initializing highlighting.  Use grey40 for CursorColumn and CursorLine when
'background' is "dark".

When reading a file and using iconv for conversion, an incomplete byte
sequence at the end caused problems. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0e ---

Default color for MatchParen when 'background' is "dark" is now DarkCyan.

":syn off" had to be used twice in a file that sets 'syntax' in a modeline.
(Michael Geddes)

When using ":vsp" or ":sp" the available space wasn't used equally between
windows. (Servatius Brandt)

Expanding <cWORD> on a trailing blank resulted in the first word in the line
if 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding.

Spell checking: spellbadword() didn't see a missing capital in the first word
of a line.  Popup menu now only suggest the capitalized word when appropriate.

When using whole line completion CTRL-L moves through the matches but it
didn't work when at the original text.

When completion finds the longest match, don't go to the first match but stick
at the original text, so that CTRL-N selects the first one.

Recognize "zsh-beta" like "zsh" for setting the 'shellpipe' default. (James
Vega)

When using ":map <expr>" and the expression results in something with a
special byte (NUL or CSI) then it didn't work properly.  Now escape special
bytes.

The default Visual highlighting for a color xterm with 8 colors was a magenta
background, which made magenta text disappear.  Now use reverse in this
specific situation.

After completing the longest match "." didn't insert the same text.  Repeating
also didn't work correctly for multi-byte text.

When using Insert mode completion and BS the whole word that was completed
would result in all possible matches.  Now stop completion.  Also fixes that
for spell completion the previous word was deleted.

GTK: When 'encoding' is "latin1" and using non-ASCII characters in a file name
the tab page label was wrong and an error message would be given.

The taglist() function could hang on a tags line with a non-ASCII character.

Win32: When 'encoding' differs from the system encoding tab page labels with
non-ASCII characters looked wrong. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Motif: building failed when Xm/Notebook.h doesn't exist.  Added a configure
check, disable GUI tabline when it's missing.

Mac: When compiled without multi-byte feature the clipboard didn't work.

It was possible to switch to another tab page when the cmdline window is open.

Completion could hang when 'lines' is 6 and a preview window was opened.

Added CTRL-W gF: open file under cursor in new tab page and jump to the line
number following the file name.
Added 'guitabtooltip'.  Implemented for Win32 (Yegappan Lakshmanan).

Added "throw" to 'debug' option: throw an exception for error messages even
whey they would otherwise be ignored.

When 'keymap' is set and a line contains an invalid entry could get a "No
mapping found" warning instead of a proper error message.

Motif: default to using XpmAttributes instead of XpmAttributes_21.

A few more changes for 64 bit MS-Windows. (George Reilly)

Got ml_get errors when doing "o" and selecting in other window where there are
less lines shorter than the cursor position in the other window.  ins_mouse()
was using position in wrong window.

Win32 GUI: Crash when giving a lot of messages during startup.  Allocate twice
as much memory for the dialog template.

Fixed a few leaks and wrong pointer use reported by coverity.

When showing menus the mode character was sometimes wrong.

Added feedkeys(). (Yakov Lerner)

Made matchlist() always return all submatches.

Moved triggering QuickFixCmdPost to before jumping to the first location.

Mac: Added the 'macatsui' option as a temporary work around for text drawing
problems.

Line completion on "/**" gave error messages when scanning an unloaded buffer.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0f ---

Win32: The height of the tab page labels is now adjusted to the font height.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: selecting the tab label was off by one. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Added tooltips for Motif and GTK tab page labels. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'encoding' is "utf-8" then ":help spell" would report an illegal byte and
the file was not converted from latin1 to utf-8.  Now retry with latin1 if
reading the file as utf-8 results in illegal bytes.

Escape the argument of feedkeys() before putting it in the typeahead buffer.
(Yukihiro Nakadaira)

Added the v:char variable for evaluating 'formatexpr'. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

With 8 colors Search highlighting combined with Statement highlighted text
made the text disappear.

VMS: avoid warnings for redefining MAX and MIN. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When 'virtualedit' includes "onemore", stopping Visual selection would still
move the cursor left.

Prevent that using CTRL-R = in Insert mode can start Visual mode.

Fixed a crash that occurred when in Insert mode with completion active and a
mapping caused edit() to be called recursively.

When using CTRL-O in Insert mode just after the last character while
'virtualedit' is "all", then typing CR moved the last character to the next
line.  Call coladvance() before starting the new line.

When using |:shell| ignore clicks on the tab page labels.  Also when using the
command line window.

When 'eventignore' is "all" then adding more to ignoring some events, e.g.,
for ":vimgrep", would actually trigger more events.

Win32: When a running Vim uses server name GVIM1 then "gvim --remote fname"
didn't find it.  When looking for a server name that doesn't end in a digit
and it is not found then use another server with that name and a number (just
like on Unix).

When using "double" in 'spellsuggest' when the language doesn't support sound
folding resulted in too many suggestions.

Win32: Dropping a shortcut on the Vim icon didn't edit the referred file like
editing it in another way would.  Use fname_expand() in buf_set_name() instead
of simply make the file name a full path.

Using feedkeys() could cause Vim to hang.

When closing another tab page from the tabline menu in Insert mode the tabline
was not updated right away.

The syntax menu didn't work in compatible mode.

After using ":tag id" twice with the same "id", ":ts" and then ":pop" a ":ts"
reported no matching tag.  Clear the cached tag name.

In Insert mode the matchparen plugin highlighted the wrong paren when there is
a string just next to a paren.

GTK: After opening a new tab page the text was sometimes not drawn correctly.
Flush output and catch up with events when updating the tab page labels.

In the GUI, using CTRL-W q to close the last window of a tab page could cause
a crash.

GTK: The tab pages line menu was not converted from 'encoding' to utf-8.

Typing a multi-byte character or a special key at the hit-enter prompt did not
work.

When 'virtualedit' contains "onemore" CTRL-O in Insert mode still moved the
cursor left when it was after the end of the line, even though it's allowed to
be there.

Added test for using tab pages.

towupper() and towlower() were not used, because of checking for
__STDC__ISO_10646__ instead of __STDC_ISO_10646__. (sertacyildiz)

For ":map <expr>" forbid changing the text, jumping to another buffer and
using ":normal" to avoid nasty side effects.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0g ---

Compilation error on HP-UX, use of "dlerr" must be inside a #ifdef.
(Gary Johnson)

Report +reltime feature in ":version" output.

The tar and zip plugins detect failure to get the contents of the archive and
edit the file as-is.

When the result of 'guitablabel' is empty fall back to the default label.

Fixed crash when using ":insert" in a while loop and missing "endwhile".

"gt" and other commands could move to another window when |textlock| active
and when the command line window was open.

Spell checking a file with syntax highlighting and a bad word at the end of
the line is ignored could make "]s" hang.

Mac: inputdialog() didn't work when compiled with big features.

Interrupting ":vimgrep" while it is busy loading a file left a modified and
hidden buffer behind.  Use enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() around
wipe_buffer().

When making 'keymap' empty the b:keymap_name variable wasn't deleted.

Using CTRL-N that searches a long time, pressing space to interrupt the
searching and accept the first match, the popup menu was still displayed
briefly.

When setting the Vim window height with -geometry the 'window' option could be
at a value that makes CTRL-F behave differently.

When opening a quickfix window in two tabs they used different buffers,
causing redrawing problems later.  Now use the same buffer for all quickfix
windows. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'mousefocus' is set moving the mouse to the text tab pages line would
move focus to the first window.  Also, the mouse pointer would jump to the
active window.

In a session file, when an empty buffer is wiped out, do this silently.

When one window has the cursor on the last line and another window is resized
to make that window smaller, the cursor line could go below the displayed
lines.  In win_new_height() subtract one from the available space.
Also avoid that using "~" lines makes the window scroll down.

Mac: When sourcing the "macmap.vim" script and then finding a .vimrc file the
'cpo' option isn't set properly, because it was already set and restored.
Added the <special> argument to ":map", so that 'cpo' doesn't need to be
changed to be able to use <> notation.  Also do this for ":menu" for
consistency.

When using "/encoding=abc" in a spell word list, only "bc" was used.

When 'encoding' and 'printencoding' were both "utf-8" then ":hardcopy" didn't
work. (Mike Williams)

Mac: When building with "--disable-gui" the install directory would still be
"/Applications" and Vim.app would be installed.  Now install in /usr/local as
usual for a console application.

GUI: when doing completion and there is one match and still searching for
another, the cursor was displayed at the end of the line instead of after the
match.  Now show the cursor after the match while still searching for matches.

GUI: The mouse shape changed on the statusline even when 'mouse' was empty and
they can't be dragged.

GTK2: Selecting a button in the confirm() dialog with Tab or cursor keys and
hitting Enter didn't select that button.  Removed GTK 1 specific code. (Neil
Bird)

When evaluating 'balloonexpr' takes a long time it could be called
recursively, which could cause a crash.

exists() could not be used to detect whether ":2match" is supported.  Added a
check for it specifically.

GTK1: Tab page labels didn't work. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Insert mode completion: When finding matches use 'ignorecase', but when adding
matches to the list don't use it, so that all words with different case are
added, "word", "Word" and "WORD".

When 'cursorline' and 'hlsearch' are set and the search pattern is "x\n"
the rest of the line was highlighted as a match.

Cursor moved while evaluating 'balloonexpr' that invokes ":isearch" and
redirects the output.  Don't move the cursor to the command line if msg_silent
is set.

exists() ignored text after a function name and option name, which could
result in false positives.

exists() ignored characters after the recognized word, which can be wrong when
using a name with non-keyword characters.  Specifically, these calls no longer
allow characters after the name: exists('*funcname') exists('*funcname(...')
exists('&option') exists(':cmd') exists('g:name') exists('g:name[n]')
exists('g:name.n')

Trigger the TabEnter autocommand only after entering the current window of the
tab page, otherwise the commands are executed with an invalid current window.

Win32: When using two monitors and Vim is on the second monitor, changing the
width of the Vim window could make it jump to the first monitor.

When scrolling back at the more prompt and the quitting a line of text would
be left behind when 'cmdheight' is 2 or more.

Fixed a few things for Insert mode completion, especially when typing BS,
CTRL-N or a printable character while still searching for matches.

Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 7.0.219
Problem:    When using the 'editexisting.vim' script and a file is being
	    edited in another tab page the window is split.  The "+123"
	    argument is not used.
Solution:   Make the tab page with the file the current tab page.  Set
	    v:swapcommand when starting up to the first "+123" or "-c" command
	    line argument.
Files:	    runtime/macros/editexisting.vim, src/main.c

Patch 7.0.220
Problem:    Crash when using winnr('#') in a new tab page. (Andy Wokula)
Solution:   Check for not finding the window.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.221
Problem:    finddir() uses 'path' by default, where "." means relative to the
	    current file.  But it works relative to the current directory.
	    (Tye Zdrojewski)
Solution:   Add the current buffer name to find_file_in_path_option() for the
	    relative file name.
Files:	    runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.229
Problem:    When 'pastetoggle' starts with Esc then pressing Esc in Insert
	    mode will not time out. (Jeffery Small)
Solution:   Use KL_PART_KEY instead of KL_PART_MAP, so that 'ttimeout' applies
	    to the 'pastetoggle' key.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 7.0.230
Problem:    After using ":lcd" a script doesn't know how to restore the
	    current directory.
Solution:   Add the haslocaldir() function. (Bob Hiestand)
Files:	    runtime/doc/usr_41.txt, runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.231
Problem:    When recovering from a swap file the page size is likely to be
	    different from the minimum.  The block used for the first page
	    then has a buffer of the wrong size, causing a crash when it's
	    reused later.  (Zephaniah Hull)
Solution:   Reallocate the buffer when the page size changes.  Also check that
	    the page size is at least the minimum value.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Patch 7.0.232 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: doesn't support GUI tab page labels.

Solution:   Disallow using feedkeys() in the sandbox.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.235
Problem:    It is possible to use writefile() in the sandbox.
Solution:   Add a few more checks for the sandbox.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.236
Problem:    Linux 2.4 uses sysinfo() with a mem_unit field, which is not
	    backwards compatible.
Solution:   Add an autoconf check for sysinfo.mem_unit.  Let mch_total_mem()
	    return Kbyte to avoid overflow.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in,
	    src/option.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 7.0.237
Problem:    For root it is recommended to not use 'modeline', but in
	    not-compatible mode the default is on.
Solution:   Let 'modeline' default to off for root.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.c

Patch 7.0.238

Solution:   Don't free the regexp program of match_hl.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 7.0.239
Problem:    When using local directories and tab pages ":mksession" uses a
	    short file name when it shouldn't.  Window-local options from a
	    modeline may be applied to the wrong window. (Teemu Likonen)
Solution:   Add the did_lcd flag, use the full path when it's set.  Don't use
	    window-local options from the modeline when using the current
	    window for another buffer in ":doautoall".
Files:	    src/fileio.c,  src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 7.0.240
Problem:    Crash when splitting a window in the GUI. (opposite of 7.0.227)
Solution:   Don't call out_flush() from win_alloc().  Also avoid this for
	    win_delete().  Also block autocommands while the window structure
	    is invalid.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 7.0.241
Problem:    ":windo throw 'foo'" loops forever. (Andy Wokula)
Solution:   Detect that win_goto() doesn't work.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 7.0.242 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Using "-register" in a Vim that does not support OLE causes
	    a crash.
Solution:   Don't use EMSG() but mch_errmsg().  Check p_go for being NULL.
	    (partly by Michael Wookey)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 7.0.243 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When GvimExt is built with MSVC 2005 or later, the "Edit
	    with vim" context menu doesn't appear in the Windows Explorer.
Solution:   Embed the linker manifest file into the resources of GvimExt.dll.
	    (Mathias Michaelis)
Files:	    src/GvimExt/Makefile

Drake)

Mac: "make install" didn't copy rgb.txt.

When editing a compressed file while there are folds caused "ml_get" errors
and some lines could be missing.  When decompressing failed option values were
not restored.


Patch 7.1a.001
Problem:    Crash when downloading a spell file.  (Szabolcs Horvat)
Solution:   Avoid that did_set_spelllang() is used recursively when a new
	    window is opened for the download.
	    Also avoid wiping out the wrong buffer.
Files:	    runtime/autoload/spellfile.vim, src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c,

Solution:   Delete the text.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 7.1b.002
Problem:    When 'maxmem' is large there can be an overflow in computations.
	    (Thomas Wiegner)
Solution:   Use the same mechanism as in mch_total_mem(): first reduce the
	    multiplier as much as possible.
Files:	    src/memfile.c

Patch 7.2a.001
Problem:    On some systems X11/Xlib.h exists (from X11-dev package) but
	    X11/Intrinsic.h does not (in Xt-dev package).  This breaks the

Patch 7.2a.010
Problem:    When a file name has an illegal byte sequence Vim may read
	    uninitialised memory.
Solution:   Don't use UTF_COMPOSINGLIKE() on an illegal byte.  In
	    msg_outtrans_len_attr() use char2cells() instead of ptr2cells().
	    In utf_ptr2char() don't check second byte when first byte is
	    illegal.  (Dominique Pelle)

==============================================================================
VERSION 7.3					*version-7.3* *version7.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.2 and 7.3.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:


Persistent undo					*new-persistent-undo*
---------------

Store undo information in a file.  Can undo to before when the file was read,
also for unloaded buffers. See |undo-persistence| (partly by Jordan Lewis)

Added the ":earlier 1f" and ":later 1f" commands.
Added file save counter to undo information.
Added the |undotree()| and |undofile()| functions.

Also added the 'undoreload' option.  This makes it possible to save the
current text when reloading the buffer, so that the reload can be undone.


More encryption					*new-more-encryption*
---------------

Support for Blowfish encryption.  Added the 'cryptmethod' option.
Mostly by Mohsin Ahmed.

Also encrypt the text in the swap file and the undo file.


Conceal text					*new-conceal*
------------

Added the |+conceal| feature.  (Vince Negri)
This allows hiding stretches of text, based on syntax highlighting.
It also allows replacing a stretch of text by a character |:syn-cchar|.
The 'conceallevel' option specifies what happens with text matching a syntax
item that has the conceal attribute.
The 'concealcursor' option specifies what happens in the cursor line.

The help files conceal characters used to mark tags and examples.

Added the |synconcealed()| function and use it for :TOhtml. (Benjamin Fritz)

Added the 'cursorbind' option, keeps the cursor in two windows with the same
text in sync.


Lua interface					*new-lua*
-------------

Added the |Lua| interface.  (Luis Carvalho)


Python3 interface				*new-python3*
-----------------

Added the Python3 interface.  It exists next to Python 2.x, both can be used
at the same time.  See |python3| (Roland Puntaier)


Changed							*changed-7.3*
-------

The MS-Windows installer no longer requires the user to type anything in the
console windows.  The installer now also works on 64 bit systems, including
the "Edit with Vim" context menu.
The gvim executable is 32 bits, the installed gvimext.dll is either a 32 or 64
bit version. (mostly by George Reilly)
Made the DOS installer work with more compilers.
The MS-Windows big gvim is now built with Python 2.7 and 3.1.2, Perl 5.12 and
Ruby 1.9.1.  You need the matching .dll files to use them.

The extra and language files are no longer distributed separately.
The source files for all systems are included in one distribution.

After using ":recover" or recovering a file in another way, ":x" and "ZZ"
didn't save what you see.  This could result in work being lost.  Now the text
after recovery is compared to the original file contents.  When they differ
the buffer is marked as modified.

When Vim is exiting because of a deadly signal, when v:dying is 2 or more,
VimLeavePre, VimLeave, BufWinLeave and BufUnload autocommands are not
executed.

Removed support for GTK 1.  It was no longer maintained and required a lot of
#ifdefs in the source code.  GTK 2 should be available for every system.
(James Vega)

It is no longer allowed to set the 'encoding' option from a modeline.  It
would corrupt the text.  (Patrick Texier)

Renamed runtime/spell/fixdup to runtime/spell/fixdup.vim.

Removed obsolete Mac code.

Updated spell files for Ubuntu locale names.

Switched from autoconf 2.63 to 2.65.

Removed Mupad indent and ftplugin files, they are not useful.

The maximum number of messages remembered in the history is now 200 (was 100).


Added							*added-7.3*
-----

Added the 'relativenumber' option. (Markus Heidelberg)

Added the 'colorcolumn' option: highlight one or more columns in a window.
E.g. to highlight the column after 'textwidth'. (partly by Gregor Uhlenheuer)

Added support for NetBeans in a terminal.  Added |:nbstart| and |:nbclose|.
(Xavier de Gaye)

More floating point functions: |acos()|, |asin()|, |atan2()|, |cosh()|,
|exp()|, |fmod()|, |log()|, |sinh()|, |tan()|, |tanh()|.  (Bill McCarthy)

Added the |gettabvar()| and |settabvar()| functions. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Added the |strchars()|, |strwidth()| and |strdisplaywidth()| functions.

Support GDK_SUPER_MASK for GTK on Mac. (Stephan Schulz)

Made CTRL and ALT modifier work for mouse wheel. (Benjamin Haskell)

Added support for horizontal scroll wheel. (Bjorn Winckler)

When the buffer is in diff mode, have :TOhtml create HTML to show the diff
side-by-side.  (Christian Brabandt)

Various improvements to ":TOhtml" and the 2html.vim script.  (Benjamin Fritz)

Add the 'L' item to 'cinoptions'. (Manuel Konig)

Improve Javascript indenting.  Add "J" flag to 'cinoptions'. (Hari Kumar G)

Mac: Support disabling antialias. (LC Mi)

Mac: Add clipboard support in the Mac console. (Bjorn Winckler)

Make it possible to drag a tab page label to another position. (Paul B. Mahol)

Better implementation of creating the Color Scheme menu. (Juergen Kraemer)

In Visual mode with 'showcmd' display the number of bytes and characters.

Allow synIDattr() getting GUI attributes when built without GUI.  (Matt
Wozniski)

Support completion for ":find".  Added test 73. (Nazri Ramliy)

Command line completion for :ownsyntax and :setfiletype. (Dominique Pelle)

Command line completion for :lmap and :lunmap.

Support syntax and filetype completion for user commands. (Christian Brabandt)

Avoid use of the GTK main_loop() so that the GtkFileChooser can be used.
(James Vega)

When 'formatexpr' evaluates to non-zero fall back to internal formatting, also
for "gq". (James Vega)

Support :browse for commands that use an error file argument. (Lech Lorens)

Support wide file names in gvimext. (Szabolcs Horvat)

Improve test for joining lines. (Milan Vancura)
Make joining a range of lines much faster. (Milan Vancura)

Add patch to improve support of z/OS (OS/390). (Ralf Schandl)

Added the helphelp.txt file.  Moved text from various.txt to it.

Added "q" item for 'statusline'.  Added |w:quickfix_title|. (Lech Lorens)

Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 7.2.041
Problem:    In diff mode, when using two tabs, each with two diffed buffers,

Solution:   Check if a compounding can possibly work before trying a
	    combination, if the compound rules don't contain wildcards.

Solution:   Adjust comment.
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 7.2.076
Problem:    rename(from, to) deletes the file if "from" and "to" are not equal

	    command ":sign unplace" and this does not trigger a "killed"
	    event.  (Xavier de Gaye)

==============================================================================
VERSION 7.4					*version-7.4* *version7.4*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.3 and 7.4.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:

- New regexp engine			|new-regexp-engine|
- A more pythonic Python interface	|better-python-interface|


New regexp engine					*new-regexp-engine*
-----------------

What is now called the "old" regexp engine uses a backtracking algorithm.  It
tries to match the pattern with the text in one way, and when that fails it
goes back and tries another way.  This works fine for simple patterns, but
complex patterns can be very slow on longer text.

The new engine uses a state machine.  It tries all possible alternatives at
the current character and stores the possible states of the pattern.  This is
a bit slower for simple patterns, but much faster for complex patterns and
long text.

Most notably, syntax highlighting for Javascript and XML files with long lines
is now working fine.  Previously Vim could get stuck.

More information here: |two-engines|


Better Python interface				*better-python-interface*
-----------------------

Added |python-bindeval| function. Unlike |python-eval| this one returns 
|python-Dictionary|, |python-List| and |python-Function| objects for 
dictionaries lists and functions respectively in place of their Python 
built-in equivalents (or None if we are talking about function references).
   For simple types this function returns Python built-in types and not only 
Python `str()` like |python-eval| does. On Python 3 it will return `bytes()` 
objects in place of `str()` ones avoiding possibility of UnicodeDecodeError.
   Interface of new objects mimics standard Python `dict()` and `list()`
interfaces to some extent. Extent will be improved in the future.

Added special |python-vars| objects also available for |python-buffer| and 
|python-window|. They ease access to VimL variables from Python.

Now you no longer need to alter `sys.path` to import your module: special 
hooks are responsible for importing from {rtp}/python2, {rtp}/python3 and 
{rtp}/pythonx directories (for Python 2, Python 3 and both respectively). 
See |python-special-path|.

Added possibility to work with |tabpage|s through |python-tabpage| object.

Added automatic conversion of Vim errors and exceptions to Python 
exceptions.

Changed the behavior of the |python-buffers| object: it now uses buffer numbers 
as keys in place of the index of the buffer in the internal buffer list. 
This should not break anything as the only way to get this index was 
iterating over |python-buffers|.

Added |:pydo| and |:py3do| commands.

Added the |pyeval()| and |py3eval()| functions.

Now in all places which previously accepted `str()` objects, `str()` and
`unicode()` (Python 2) or `bytes()` and `str()` (Python 3) are accepted.

|python-window| has gained `.col` and `.row` attributes that are currently 
the only way to get internal window positions.

Added or fixed support for `dir()` in Vim Python objects.


Changed							*changed-7.4*
-------

Old Python versions (2.2) are no longer supported. Building with them did 
not work anyway.

Options:
	Added ability to automatically save the selection into the system 
	clipboard when using non-GUI version of Vim (autoselectplus in 
	'clipboard'). Also added ability to use the system clipboard as
	default register (previously only primary selection could be used).
	(Ivan Krasilnikov, Christian Brabandt, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added a special 'shiftwidth' value that makes 'sw' follow 'tabstop'.
	As indenting via 'indentexpr' became tricky |shiftwidth()| function
	was added. Also added equivalent special value to 'softtabstop'
	option.  (Christian Brabandt, so8res)

	Show absolute number in number column when 'relativenumber' option is
	on.  Now there are four combinations with 'number' and
	'relativenumber'.  (Christian Brabandt)

Commands:
	|:diffoff| now saves the local values of some settings and restores 
	them in place of blindly resetting them to the defaults. (Christian 
	Brabandt)

Other:
	Lua interface now also uses userdata binded to Vim structures. (Taro 
	Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	glob() and autocommand patterns used to work with the undocumented
	"\{n,m\}" item from a regexp.  "\{" is now used for a literal "{", as
	this is normal in shell file patterns.  Now used "\\\{n,m\}" to get
	"\{n,m}" in the regexp pattern.

Added							*added-7.4*
-----

Various syntax, indent and other plugins were added.

Added support for |Lists| and |Dictionaries| in |viminfo|. (Christian
Brabandt)

Functions:
	Bitwise functions: |and()|, |or()|, |invert()|, |xor()|.

	Added |luaeval()| function. (Taro Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	Added |sha256()| function. (Tyru, Hirohito Higashi)

	Added |wildmenumode()| function. (Christian Brabandt)

	Debugging functions: |screenattr()|, |screenchar()|, |screencol()|, 
	|screenrow()|. (Simon Ruderich, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added ability to use |Dictionary-function|s for |sort()|ing, via 
	optional third argument. (Nikolay Pavlov)

	Added special |expand()| argument that expands to the current line 
	number.

	Made it possible to force |char2nr()| to always give unicode codepoints 
	regardless of current encoding. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

	Made it possible for functions generating file list generate |List| 
	and not NL-separated string. (e.g. |glob()|, |expand()|) (Christian 
	Brabandt)

	Functions that obtain variables from the specific window, tabpage or 
	buffer scope dictionary can now return specified default value in

	changed.

Commands:
	|:syntime| command useful for debugging.

	Made it possible to remove all signs from the current buffer using 
	|:sign-unplace|. (Christian Brabandt)

	Added |:language| autocompletion. (Dominique Pelle)

	color schemes, compilers, |:cscope| suboptions, files from 'path', 
	|:history| suboptions, locale names, |:syntime| suboptions, user 
	names. (Dominique Pelle)

	Added |:map-nowait| creating mapping which when having lhs that is the 
	prefix of another mappings lhs will not allow Vim to wait for user to 
	type more characters to resolve ambiguity, forcing Vim to take the 
	shorter alternative: one with <nowait>.

Options:
	Made it possible to ignore case when completing: 'wildignorecase'.

	Added ability to delete comment leader when using |J| by `j` flag in 
	'formatoptions' (|fo-table|). (Lech Lorens)

	Added ability to control indentation inside namespaces: |cino-N|. 
	(Konstantin Lepa)
