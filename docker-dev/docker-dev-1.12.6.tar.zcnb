.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION\*(R"\s0.
.PP
\&\fBsed\fR returns an exit code of 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
A file specified as argument to the \fBw\fR edit command is by default
opened before input processing starts. Using \fB\-a\fR, opening of such
files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.

.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4

.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.

.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2,\s0 consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE.\s0
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)

enclosed in \fB[:\fR and \fB:]\fR and represents the set of characters
as defined in \fIctype\fR\|(3).
.PP
If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.
.PP
To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR', place it anywhere else but first. To
include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR' place it first or immediately after an
initial \fB^\fR. To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' make it the first (or
second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.
.PP
The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED\s0 \s-1SCRIPT\s0 \s-1TRANSLATION\s0\*(R".
.PP
\&\fBsed\fR returns an exit code of 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
A file specified as argument to the \fBw\fR edit command is by default
opened before input processing starts. Using \fB\-a\fR, opening of such
files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIscript-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f script-file"
Editing commands from the specified \fIscript-file\fR are read and appended
to the script.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "number"
The line with the given number is selected.
.IP "\fB$\fR" 4
.IX Item "$"
A dollar sign (\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR) is the line number of the last line of the input stream.
.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC\s0 \s-1REGULAR\s0 \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0\*(R"), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with each
function synopsis below.
.PP
The argument \fItext\fR consists of one or more lines following the command.
Embedded newlines in \fItext\fR must be preceded with a backslash.  Other
backslashes in \fItext\fR are deleted and the following character is taken
literally.
.IP "[1addr]\fBa\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]a text"
Write \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output immediately before reading the next line
of input, either by executing the \fBN\fR function or by beginning a new cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBb\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]b [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR. If no label
is given, branch to the end of the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBc\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]c text"
The line, or range of lines, selected by the address is deleted. 
The \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
is written to standard output. With an address range, this occurs at
the end of the range.
.IP "[2addr]\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]d"
Deletes the pattern space and starts the next cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBD\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]D"
Deletes the pattern space through the first embedded newline or to the end.
If the pattern space becomes empty, a new cycle is started, otherwise
execution of the script is restarted.
.IP "[2addr]\fBg\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]g"
Replace the contents of the pattern space with the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBG\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]G"
Append a newline and the contents of the hold space to the pattern space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]h"
Replace the contents of the hold space with the pattern space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBH\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]H"
Append a newline and the contents of the pattern space to the hold space.
.IP "[1addr]\fBi\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]i text"
Write the \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output.
.IP "[2addr]\fBl\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]l"
Print the contents of the pattern space: non-printable characters are
shown in C\-style escaped form; long lines are split and have a trailing
^'\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' at the point of the split; the true end of a line is marked with
a '\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR'. Escapes are: '\ea', '\et', '\en', '\ef', '\er', '\ee' for
\&\s-1BEL\s0, \s-1HT\s0, \s-1LF\s0, \s-1FF\s0, \s-1CR\s0, \s-1ESC\s0, respectively, and '\e' followed by a three-digit
octal number for all other non-printable characters.
.IP "[2addr]\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]n"
If automatic printing is enabled, write the pattern space to the standard
output. Replace the pattern space with the next line of input. If
there is no more input, processing is terminated.
.IP "[2addr]\fBN\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]N"
Append a newline and the next line of input to the pattern space. If
there is no more input, processing is terminated.
.IP "[2addr]\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]p"
Print the pattern space to the standard output. (Use the \fB\-n\fR option
to suppress automatic printing at the end of a cycle if you want to
avoid double printing of lines.)
.IP "[2addr]\fBP\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]P"
Prints the pattern space through the first embedded newline or to the end.
.IP "[1addr]\fBq\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]q"
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new cycle.
.IP "[1addr]\fBr\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]r file"
Copy the contents of the \fIfile\fR to standard output immediately before
the next attempt to read a line of input. Any error encountered while
reading \fIfile\fR is silently ignored.
.IP "[2addr]\fBs/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags"
Substitute the \fIreplacement\fR string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the \fIregular expression\fR.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a 
slash to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.
To use the delimiter as a literal character within the regular expression
and the replacement, precede the character by a backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.Sp
Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by
preceding a newline with a backslash.
.Sp
Within the replacement, an ampersand ('\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR') is replaced by the string
matching the regular expression. The strings '\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR' through '\f(CW\*(C`\e9\*(C'\fR' are
replaced by the corresponding subpattern (see \*(L"\s-1BASIC\s0 \s-1REGULAR\s0 \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0\*(R").
To get a literal '\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' in the replacement text, precede it
by a backslash.
.Sp
The following \fIflags\fR modify the behaviour of the \fBs\fR command:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBg\fR" 8
.IX Item "g"
The replacement is performed for all matching, non-overlapping substrings
of the pattern space.
.IP "\fB1\fR..\fB9\fR" 8
.IX Item "1..9"
Replace only the n\-th matching substring of the pattern space.
.IP "\fBp\fR" 8
.IX Item "p"
If the substitution was made, print the new value of the pattern space.
.IP "\fBw\fR \fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "w file"
If the substitution was made, write the new value of the pattern space
to the specified file.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "[2addr]\fBt\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]t [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR if any \fBs\fR
substitutions have been made since the most recent reading of an input line
or execution of a \fBt\fR function. If no label is given, branch to the end of
the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBw\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]w file"
The contents of the pattern space are written to the \fIfile\fR.
.IP "[2addr]\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]x"
Swap the contents of the pattern space and the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBy\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring1\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring2\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]y/string1/string2/"
In the pattern space, replace all characters occurring in \fIstring1\fR by the
character at the corresponding position in \fIstring2\fR. It is possible
to use any character (other than a backslash or newline) instead of a
slash to delimit the strings.  Within \fIstring1\fR and \fIstring2\fR, a
backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that literal
character, and a backslash followed by an 'n' is replaced by a newline
character.
.IP "[1addr]\fB=\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]="
Prints the current line number on the standard output.
.IP "[0addr]\fB:\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]: [label]"
The command specifies the position of the \fIlabel\fR. It has no other effect.
.IP "[2addr]\fB{\fR [\fIcommand\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]{ [command]"
.PD 0
.IP "[0addr]\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]}"
.PD
These two commands begin and end a command list. The first command may
be given on the same line as the opening \fB{\fR command. The commands
within the list are jointly selected by the address(es) given on the
\&\fB{\fR command (but may still have individual addresses).
.IP "[0addr]\fB#\fR [\fIcomment\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]# [comment]"
The entire line is ignored (treated as a comment). If, however, the first
two characters in the script are '\f(CW\*(C`#n\*(C'\fR', automatic printing of output is
suppressed, as if the \fB\-n\fR option were given on the command line.
.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX\s0 1003.2, consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE\s0.
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)
.PP
A character class is one of the class names
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   alnum     digit     punct

.Ve
.PP
enclosed in \fB[:\fR and \fB:]\fR and represents the set of characters
as defined in \fIctype\fR\|(3).
.PP
If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.
.PP
To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR', place it anywhere else but first. To
include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR' place it first or immediately after an
initial \fB^\fR. To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' make it the first (or
second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.
.PP
The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)
.SS "Additional Atoms"

The meaning of an empty regular expression ('\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR'), as defined by \fBsed\fR,
is \*(L"the last pattern used, at run time\*(R". This deviates from the Perl
interpretation, which will re-use the \*(L"last last successfully executed
regular expression\*(R". Since keeping track of pattern usage would create
terribly cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
context (where other \fBsed\fR implementations appear to deviate, too),
the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature,
such as in \f(CW\*(C`/abc/s//xyz/\*(C'\fR, will work as expected.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION\*(R"\s0.

files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIscript-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f script-file"
Editing commands from the specified \fIscript-file\fR are read and appended
to the script.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"

\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "number"
The line with the given number is selected.
.IP "\fB$\fR" 4
.IX Item "$"
A dollar sign (\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR) is the line number of the last line of the input stream.
.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with each
function synopsis below.
.PP
The argument \fItext\fR consists of one or more lines following the command.
Embedded newlines in \fItext\fR must be preceded with a backslash.  Other
backslashes in \fItext\fR are deleted and the following character is taken
literally.
.IP "[1addr]\fBa\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]a text"
Write \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output immediately before reading the next line
of input, either by executing the \fBN\fR function or by beginning a new cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBb\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]b [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR. If no label
is given, branch to the end of the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBc\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]c text"
The line, or range of lines, selected by the address is deleted. 
The \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
is written to standard output. With an address range, this occurs at
the end of the range.
.IP "[2addr]\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]d"

Substitute the \fIreplacement\fR string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the \fIregular expression\fR.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a 
slash to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.
To use the delimiter as a literal character within the regular expression
and the replacement, precede the character by a backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.Sp
Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by
preceding a newline with a backslash.
.Sp
Within the replacement, an ampersand ('\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR') is replaced by the string
matching the regular expression. The strings '\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR' through '\f(CW\*(C`\e9\*(C'\fR' are
replaced by the corresponding subpattern (see \*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0).
To get a literal '\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' in the replacement text, precede it
by a backslash.

.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2,\s0 consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE.\s0
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)
.PP
A character class is one of the class names
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   alnum     digit     punct
\&   alpha     graph     space
\&   blank     lower     upper
\&   cntrl     print     xdigit
.Ve
.PP
enclosed in \fB[:\fR and \fB:]\fR and represents the set of characters
as defined in \fIctype\fR\|(3).
.PP
If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.
.PP
To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR', place it anywhere else but first. To
include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR' place it first or immediately after an
initial \fB^\fR. To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' make it the first (or
second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.
.PP
The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)
.SS "Additional Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Additional Atoms"
Since some sed implementations provide additional regular expression
atoms (not defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2\s0), \fBpsed\fR is capable of translating
the following backslash escapes:

The meaning of an empty regular expression ('\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR'), as defined by \fBsed\fR,
is \*(L"the last pattern used, at run time\*(R". This deviates from the Perl
interpretation, which will re-use the \*(L"last last successfully executed
regular expression\*(R". Since keeping track of pattern usage would create
terribly cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
context (where other \fBsed\fR implementations appear to deviate, too),
the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature,
such as in \f(CW\*(C`/abc/s//xyz/\*(C'\fR, will work as expected.

.Nm
is a tool to convert PostScript input data into a PDF document. The input data may
come from a file or may be read from stdin. The PDF document is always written to
a file. The name of the output PDF file is derived from the name of the input file or may
be explicitly named using the -o option.

.It Fl o Ar outname
The name of the output file to create. If an explicit file name is not supplied, 
the output file will be created in the current directory and named 
.Ar foo.pdf 
for an input file named
.Ar foo.ps
.It Fl i
Reads from stdin rather than a named input file. If the output file is not explicitly 
named and the input data comes from 
.Ar stdin
the named output file will be
.Ar stdin.pdf
.It Fl l
Specifies that any messages generated during file conversion be written to
a log file. For an output file named
.Ar foo.pdf
the generated log file is
.Ar foo.pdf.log
rather than generated to stdout. If there are no messages, the log file is
not generated.
.It Fl p
Generates a simple progress message to stdout at the end of each page. Because conversion
of complex or lengthy PostScript input can take time, it is sometimes useful to
see that progress is being made. Progress messages are always written to stdout even
when the -l (log file) option is specified.

.PP
Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
binary dumps or poking around the kernel.
.PP
Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.
.PP
So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's more
robust.
.PP
Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:
.PP

Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You can control
the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal,
leading zeroes or whatever.
.PP
All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC\-style stabs.  The \fB\-g\fR option on native \s-1BSD\s0 compilers and \s-1GCC\s0
should get this for you.
.PP
To learn more, just type a bogus option, like \fB\-\e?\fR, and a long usage message
will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.
.PP
If you're only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for you.
You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the source and run it
when you feel like it.  Or not.
.PP
But if you're a perl programmer, then for you I have something much more
wondrous than just a structure offset printer.
.PP
You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code
generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well, structure and union
declarations at least, but that's quite a bit.
.PP
Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of
the C structures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,
when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the
sgtty structure was laid out differently, your program broke.  Which is
a shame.
.PP
We've had Larry's h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on
cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offer
you is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I've couched
them in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the following program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
\&
\&    require \*(Aqsyscall.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/time.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/resource.ph\*(Aq;
\&
\&    $ru = "\e0" x &rusage\*(Aqsizeof();
\&
\&    syscall(&SYS_getrusage, &RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)      && die "getrusage: $!";
\&
\&    @ru = unpack($t = &rusage\*(Aqtypedef(), $ru);
\&
\&    $utime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    $stime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    printf "you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\en", $utime, $stime;
.Ve
.PP
As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.  Regular
fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessor functions are
provided for your convenience:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first\-level
\&                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing
\&                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this
\&
\&
\&                    $usec = $u[ &user\*(Aqu_utimer
\&                                + (&ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &itimerval\*(Aqstruct)
\&                                + &itimerval\*(Aqit_value
\&                                + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec
\&                              ];
\&
\&    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
\&                you pass it an argument, such as
\&
\&                        &rusage\*(Aqsizeof(&rusage\*(Aqru_utime)
\&
\&    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
\&                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
\&                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
\&                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
\&                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
\&                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.
\&
\&    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
\&                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
\&                into the packed structure with vec() if you\*(Aqre too lazy
\&                to unpack it.
\&
\&    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
\&                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
\&                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
\&                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
\&                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I\*(Aqll post such
\&                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.
.Ve
.PP
The way I see this being used is like basically this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        % h2ph <some_include_file.h  >  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  >> /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % install
.Ve
.PP
It's a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includes right.
I can't know this for your system, but it's not usually too terribly difficult.
.PP
The code isn't pretty as I mentioned  \*(-- I never thought it would be a 1000\-
line program when I started, or I might not have begun. :\-)  But I would have
been less cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with each
other, etc.  It might also have helped if I didn't have to divine the makeup
of the stabs on the fly, and then account for micro differences between my
compiler and gcc.
.PP
Anyway, here it is.  Should run on perl v4 or greater.  Maybe less.

.PP
Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
binary dumps or poking around the kernel.
.PP
Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.
.PP
So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's more
robust.
.PP
Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:

Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You can control
the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal,
leading zeroes or whatever.
.PP
All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC\-style stabs.  The \fB\-g\fR option on native \s-1BSD\s0 compilers and \s-1GCC\s0
should get this for you.
.PP
To learn more, just type a bogus option, like \fB\-\e?\fR, and a long usage message
will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.
.PP
If you're only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for you.
You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the source and run it
when you feel like it.  Or not.
.PP
But if you're a perl programmer, then for you I have something much more
wondrous than just a structure offset printer.
.PP
You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code
generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well, structure and union
declarations at least, but that's quite a bit.
.PP
Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of
the C structures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,
when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the
sgtty structure was laid out differently, your program broke.  Which is
a shame.
.PP
We've had Larry's h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on
cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offer
you is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I've couched
them in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the following program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
\&
\&    require \*(Aqsyscall.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/time.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/resource.ph\*(Aq;
\&
\&    $ru = "\e0" x &rusage\*(Aqsizeof();
\&
\&    syscall(&SYS_getrusage, &RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)      && die "getrusage: $!";
\&
\&    @ru = unpack($t = &rusage\*(Aqtypedef(), $ru);
\&
\&    $utime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    $stime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    printf "you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\en", $utime, $stime;
.Ve
.PP
As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.  Regular
fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessor functions are
provided for your convenience:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first\-level
\&                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing
\&                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this
\&
\&
\&                    $usec = $u[ &user\*(Aqu_utimer
\&                                + (&ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &itimerval\*(Aqstruct)
\&                                + &itimerval\*(Aqit_value
\&                                + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec
\&                              ];
\&
\&    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
\&                you pass it an argument, such as
\&
\&                        &rusage\*(Aqsizeof(&rusage\*(Aqru_utime)
\&
\&    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
\&                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
\&                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
\&                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
\&                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
\&                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.
\&
\&    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
\&                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
\&                into the packed structure with vec() if you\*(Aqre too lazy
\&                to unpack it.
\&
\&    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
\&                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
\&                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
\&                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
\&                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I\*(Aqll post such
\&                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.
.Ve
.PP
The way I see this being used is like basically this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        % h2ph <some_include_file.h  >  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  >> /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % install
.Ve
.PP
It's a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includes right.
I can't know this for your system, but it's not usually too terribly difficult.
.PP
The code isn't pretty as I mentioned  \*(-- I never thought it would be a 1000\-
line program when I started, or I might not have begun. :\-)  But I would have
been less cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with each
other, etc.  It might also have helped if I didn't have to divine the makeup
of the stabs on the fly, and then account for micro differences between my
compiler and gcc.
.PP
Anyway, here it is.  Should run on perl v4 or greater.  Maybe less.

.PP
Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
binary dumps or poking around the kernel.
.PP
Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.
.PP
So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's more
robust.
.PP
Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:

Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You can control
the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal,
leading zeroes or whatever.
.PP
All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC\-style stabs.  The \fB\-g\fR option on native \s-1BSD\s0 compilers and \s-1GCC\s0
should get this for you.
.PP
To learn more, just type a bogus option, like \fB\-\e?\fR, and a long usage message
will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.
.PP
If you're only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for you.
You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the source and run it
when you feel like it.  Or not.
.PP
But if you're a perl programmer, then for you I have something much more
wondrous than just a structure offset printer.
.PP
You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code
generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well, structure and union
declarations at least, but that's quite a bit.
.PP
Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of
the C structures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,
when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the
sgtty structure was laid out differently, your program broke.  Which is
a shame.
.PP
We've had Larry's h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on
cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offer
you is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I've couched
them in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the following program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
\&
\&    require \*(Aqsyscall.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/time.ph\*(Aq;
\&    require \*(Aqsys/resource.ph\*(Aq;
\&
\&    $ru = "\e0" x &rusage\*(Aqsizeof();
\&
\&    syscall(&SYS_getrusage, &RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)      && die "getrusage: $!";
\&
\&    @ru = unpack($t = &rusage\*(Aqtypedef(), $ru);
\&
\&    $utime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_utime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    $stime =  $ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage\*(Aqru_stime + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec ]) / 1e6;
\&
\&    printf "you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\en", $utime, $stime;
.Ve
.PP
As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.  Regular
fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessor functions are
provided for your convenience:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first\-level
\&                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing
\&                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this
\&
\&
\&                    $usec = $u[ &user\*(Aqu_utimer
\&                                + (&ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &itimerval\*(Aqstruct)
\&                                + &itimerval\*(Aqit_value
\&                                + &timeval\*(Aqtv_usec
\&                              ];
\&
\&    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
\&                you pass it an argument, such as
\&
\&                        &rusage\*(Aqsizeof(&rusage\*(Aqru_utime)
\&
\&    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
\&                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
\&                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
\&                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
\&                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
\&                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.
\&
\&    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
\&                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
\&                into the packed structure with vec() if you\*(Aqre too lazy
\&                to unpack it.
\&
\&    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
\&                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
\&                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
\&                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
\&                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I\*(Aqll post such
\&                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.
.Ve
.PP
The way I see this being used is like basically this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        % h2ph <some_include_file.h  >  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  >> /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % install
.Ve
.PP
It's a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includes right.
I can't know this for your system, but it's not usually too terribly difficult.
.PP
The code isn't pretty as I mentioned  \*(-- I never thought it would be a 1000\-
line program when I started, or I might not have begun. :\-)  But I would have
been less cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with each
other, etc.  It might also have helped if I didn't have to divine the makeup
of the stabs on the fly, and then account for micro differences between my
compiler and gcc.
.PP
Anyway, here it is.  Should run on perl v4 or greater.  Maybe less.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This utility allows you to apply pattern matching to \fBthe contents\fR of files
contained in a tar archive.  You might use this to identify all files in an
archive which contain lines matching the specified pattern and either print out
the pathnames or extract the files.
.PP
The pattern will be used as a Perl regular expression (as opposed to a simple
grep regex).
.PP
Multiple tar archive filenames can be specified \- they will each be processed
in turn.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-basename\fR (alias \-b)" 4
.IX Item "--basename (alias -b)"
When matching files are extracted, ignore the directory path from the archive
and write to the current directory using the basename of the file from the
archive.  Beware: if two matching files in the archive have the same basename,
the second file extracted will overwrite the first.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR (alias \-i)" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-case (alias -i)"
Make pattern matching case-insensitive.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\-only\fR (alias \-l)" 4
.IX Item "--list-only (alias -l)"
Print the pathname of each matching file from the archive to \s-1STDOUT. \s0 Without
this option, the default behaviour is to extract each matching file.
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fR (alias \-v)" 4

This utility allows you to apply pattern matching to \fBthe contents\fR of files
contained in a tar archive.  You might use this to identify all files in an
archive which contain lines matching the specified pattern and either print out
the pathnames or extract the files.

The pattern will be used as a Perl regular expression (as opposed to a simple
grep regex).

When matching files are extracted, ignore the directory path from the archive
and write to the current directory using the basename of the file from the
archive.  Beware: if two matching files in the archive have the same basename,
the second file extracted will overwrite the first.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR (alias \-i)" 4

.Sh NAME
.Nm pubsub 
.Nd Utility for managing RSS/Atom subscriptions via the PubSub framework
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -client Ar bundleID
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar parameters
.Sh OPTIONS
The available options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl -client
Force tool \&to act \&as one specific client
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The 
.Li pubsub
tool \&is \&a command-line utility for interacting with the PubSub framework. \&It \&is intended for troubleshooting, \&as \&a simple way \&to see \&at \&a glance all the feed subscriptions that the agent will \&be periodically fetching, and \&to delete any left-over subscriptions (for example, \&of \&an application that's been deleted.) 
.Pp
\&If the 
.Li --client
flag \&is given, the tool will act only \&on the PubSub client with the given bundle ID. For example, 
.Li pubsub list
will list only the feeds that client \&is subscribed to. Some subcommands, such \&as 
.Li subscribe,
require \&a client \&to \&be specified. 
.Pp
The following subcommands are supported. Note that some have multi-word names. \&If \&no subcommand \&is given, \&a short listing \&of their names will \&be output. 
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXX
.It  Nm list
Lists all feeds (of all clients, \&or \&of the specific client \&if the 
.Li -client
flag \&is given.) The title, URL and refresh interval \&of each feed are shown. Note that \&a feed subscribed \&by multiple clients will \&be listed once per client, and that each client may specify \&a different refresh interval. However, the PubSub agent will only fetch one copy \&of the feed, \&at the minimum interval. The interval \&is listed \&in parentheses \&if \&it \&is inherited from the client's default refresh interval. The interval \&is followed \&by \&a \&"
.Li \&*
\&" \&if the feed will \&be refreshed even when the client application \&is not currently running. The interval \&is followed \&by \&a \&"
.Li \&*
\&" \&if file enclosures will automatically \&be downloaded. 
.It  Nm list clients
Lists all registered clients \&by bundle ID, along with their number \&of subscriptions. 
.It  Nm list client Li bundleID
Lists only the feeds subscribed \&to \&by the given client. 
.It  Nm unsubscribe Li URL
Unsubscribes from the feed with the given URL. 
.It  Nm subscribe Li URL
Subscribes the client (which must \&be specified using 
.Li --client
\&) \&to the given feed. 
.It  Nm list Li URL
Lists all entries currently stored for the given feed. 
.It  Nm dump Li URL
Prints the raw XML \&of the feed, \&as \&it was last fetched from the network. 
.It  Nm list entry Li identifier
Lists the attributes \&of \&an individual entry, given its identifier \&(a 40-char hex string). 
.It  Nm dump entry Li identifier
Prints the XML \&of \&an entry, given its identifier \&(a 40-char hex string). 
.It  Nm refresh Li URL
Fetches the feed from the network immediately, and updates the database \&if \&it has changed. 
.It  Nm listen Li [timestamp]
Installs \&a PSClient delegate and listens for changes \&to subscribed feeds and entries, printing messages when they occur. \&If \&a timestamp \&is given, all changes that have occurred since that time will first \&be printed. The timestamp \&is given \&as \&a number \&of seconds since the system "reference date", i.e. the same \&as the result \&of 
.Li -[NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate].
.It  Nm list downloads
Lists all enclosures currently being downloaded.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl L | P
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
Some shells may provide a builtin
.Nm
command which is similar or identical to this utility.
Consult the
.Xr builtin 1
manual page.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L
Display the logical current working directory.
.It Fl P
Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic links resolved).
.El
.Pp
If no options are specified, the
.\" 4207130
.Fl L
option is assumed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev PWD"
.It Ev PWD
Logical current working directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr builtin 1 ,
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster because it is built into that shell.
However, it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it.
.Pp
The
.Fl L
option does not work unless the
.Ev PWD
environment variable is exported by the shell.

.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
`pwhich' is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
programs based on the user's \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR. It is similar to the usualy Unix
tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
purely in Perl (uses the module \f(CW\*(C`File::Which\*(C'\fR), so is portable.

The option \fI\-a\fR will make \f(CW\*(C`pwhich\*(C'\fR print all matches found in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR variable instead of just the first one. Each match is printed
on a separate line.

Originated in \fImodperl\-2.0/lib/Apache/Build.pm\fR. Changed for use in DocSet
(for the mod_perl site) and Win32\-awareness by me, with slight modifications
by Stas Bekman, then extracted to create \f(CW\*(C`File::Which\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Version 0.04 had some significant platform-related changes, taken from
the Perl Power Tools \f(CW\`which\*(Aq\fR implementation by Abigail with
enhancements from Peter Prymmer. See

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm python
.Ar ...
.Nm pythonw
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
To support multiple versions, the programs named
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
select the real version of Python to run, depending on various
settings.
The current supported versions are
.Sy 2.6
and
.Sy 2.7 ,
with the default being
.Sy 2.7 .
Use
.Pp
.Dl % man python2.6
.Dl % man python2.7
.Dl % man pythonw2.6
.Dl % man pythonw2.7
.Pp
to see the man page for a specific version.
Without a version specified these will show the man page for the (unmodified) default
version of Python
.Sy ( 2.7 ) .
To see the man page for a specific version of pydoc, for example, use
.Pp
.Dl % man pydoc2.6
.Sh CHANGING THE DEFAULT PYTHON
Using
.Pp
.Dl % defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.6
.Pp
will make version
.Sy 2.6
the user default when running both the
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
commands
.Sy ( versioner
is the internal name of the version-selection software used).
.Pp
The environment variable
.Ev VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION
can also be used to set the
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
version:
.Pp
.D1 Li % export VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=2.6 Em # Bourne-like shells
.D1 Li "    " Sy or
.D1 Li % setenv VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION 2.6 Em # C-like shells
.Dl % python ...
.Pp
This environment variable takes precedence over the preference file settings.
.Sh USING A SPECIFIC VERSION
Rather than using the
.Nm python
command, one can use a specific version directly.
For example, running
.Nm python2.6
from the command line will run the
.Sy 2.6
version of Python.
.Pp
One can use a specific version of Python on the
.Em #!
line of a script, but that may have portability and future compatibility issues.
.Pp
Note that the preference files and environment variables that apply to the
.Nm python
command do
.Sy not
apply when running a specific version of Python.
In particular, running
.Nm python2.6
will always default to 64-bit execution
(unless one uses the
.Xr arch 1
command to specifically select a 32-bit architecture).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
For an introduction to programming in Python you are referred to the
Python Tutorial.
The Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types,
constants, functions and modules.
Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and
semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.
(These documents may be located via the
.B "INTERNET RESOURCES"
below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
.PP
Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in
C or C++.
On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.
Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing
applications.
See the internal documentation for hints.
.PP
Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be 
viewed by running the 
.B pydoc
program.  
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
Don't write
.I .py[co]
files on import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.
.TP
.BI "\-c " command
Specify the command to execute (see next section).
This terminates the option list (following options are passed as
arguments to the command).
.TP
.B \-d
Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on
compilation options).
.TP
.B \-E
Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that modify
the behavior of the interpreter.
.TP
.B \-h ", " \-? ", "\-\-help
Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.
.TP
.B \-i
When a script is passed as first argument or the \fB\-c\fP option is
used, enter interactive mode after executing the script or the
command.  It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can be
useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script
raises an exception.
.TP
.BI "\-m " module-name
Searches 
.I sys.path 
for the named module and runs the corresponding 
.I .py 
file as a script.
.TP
.B \-O
Turn on basic optimizations.  This changes the filename extension for
compiled (bytecode) files from
.I .pyc
to \fI.pyo\fP.  Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.
.TP
.B \-O0
Discard docstrings in addition to the \fB-O\fP optimizations.
.TP
.B \-R
Turn on "hash randomization", so that the hash() values of str, bytes and
datetime objects are "salted" with an unpredictable pseudo-random value.
Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are
not predictable between repeated invocations of Python.
.IP
This is intended to provide protection against a denial of service
caused by carefully-chosen inputs that exploit the worst case performance
of a dict construction, O(n^2) complexity.  See
http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html
for details.
.TP
.BI "\-Q " argument
Division control; see PEP 238.  The argument must be one of "old" (the
default, int/int and long/long return an int or long), "new" (new
division semantics, i.e. int/int and long/long returns a float),
"warn" (old division semantics with a warning for int/int and
long/long), or "warnall" (old division semantics with a warning for
all use of the division operator).  For a use of "warnall", see the
Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.
.TP
.B \-s
Don't add user site directory to sys.path.
.TP
.B \-S
Disable the import of the module
.I site
and the site-dependent manipulations of
.I sys.path
that it entails.
.TP
.B \-t
Issue a warning when a source file mixes tabs and spaces for
indentation in a way that makes it depend on the worth of a tab
expressed in spaces.  Issue an error when the option is given twice.
.TP
.B \-u
Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered.  On systems
where it matters, also put stdin, stdout and stderr in binary mode.
Note that there is internal buffering in xreadlines(), readlines() and
file-object iterators ("for line in sys.stdin") which is not
influenced by this option.  To work around this, you will want to use
"sys.stdin.readline()" inside a "while 1:" loop.
.TP
.B \-v
Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place
(filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded.  When given
twice, print a message for each file that is checked for when 
searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup
at exit.
.TP
.B \-V ", " \-\-version
Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.
.TP
.BI "\-W " argument
Warning control.  Python sometimes prints warning message to
.IR sys.stderr .
A typical warning message has the following form:
.IB file ":" line ": " category ": " message.
By default, each warning is printed once for each source line where it
occurs.  This option controls how often warnings are printed.
Multiple
.B \-W
options may be given; when a warning matches more than one
option, the action for the last matching option is performed.
Invalid
.B \-W
options are ignored (a warning message is printed about invalid
options when the first warning is issued).  Warnings can also be
controlled from within a Python program using the
.I warnings
module.

The simplest form of
.I argument
is one of the following
.I action
strings (or a unique abbreviation):
.B ignore
to ignore all warnings;
.B default
to explicitly request the default behavior (printing each warning once
per source line);
.B all
to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate many
messages if a warning is triggered repeatedly for the same source
line, such as inside a loop);
.B module
to print each warning only the first time it occurs in each
module;
.B once
to print each warning only the first time it occurs in the program; or
.B error
to raise an exception instead of printing a warning message.

The full form of
.I argument
is
.IB action : message : category : module : line.
Here,
.I action
is as explained above but only applies to messages that match the
remaining fields.  Empty fields match all values; trailing empty
fields may be omitted.  The
.I message
field matches the start of the warning message printed; this match is
case-insensitive.  The
.I category
field matches the warning category.  This must be a class name; the
match test whether the actual warning category of the message is a
subclass of the specified warning category.  The full class name must
be given.  The
.I module
field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this match is
case-sensitive.  The
.I line
field matches the line number, where zero matches all line numbers and
is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.
.TP
.B \-x
Skip the first line of the source.  This is intended for a DOS
specific hack only.  Warning: the line numbers in error messages will
be off by one!
.TP
.B \-3
Warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix.
.SH INTERPRETER INTERFACE
The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when
called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for
commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a
file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and
executes a
.I script
from that file;
when called with
.B \-c
.I command,
it executes the Python statement(s) given as
.I command.
Here
.I command
may contain multiple statements separated by newlines.
Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!
In non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is
executed.
.PP
If available, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are
passed to the script in the Python variable
.I sys.argv ,
which is a list of strings (you must first
.I import sys
to be able to access it).
If no script name is given,
.I sys.argv[0]
is an empty string; if
.B \-c
is used,
.I sys.argv[0]
contains the string
.I '-c'.
Note that options interpreted by the Python interpreter itself
are not placed in
.I sys.argv.
.PP
In interactive mode, the primary prompt is `>>>'; the second prompt
(which appears when a command is not complete) is `...'.
The prompts can be changed by assignment to
.I sys.ps1
or
.I sys.ps2.
The interpreter quits when it reads an EOF at a prompt.
When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is printed and
control returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the
interpreter exits after printing the stack trace.
The interrupt signal raises the
.I Keyboard\%Interrupt
exception; other UNIX signals are not caught (except that SIGPIPE is
sometimes ignored, in favor of the
.I IOError
exception).  Error messages are written to stderr.
.SH FILES AND DIRECTORIES
These are subject to difference depending on local installation
conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent
and should be interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same.
The default for both is \fI/usr/local\fP.
.IP \fI${exec_prefix}/bin/python\fP
Recommended location of the interpreter.
.PP
.I ${prefix}/lib/python<version>
.br
.I ${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>
.RS
Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard
modules.
.RE
.PP
.I ${prefix}/include/python<version>
.br
.I ${exec_prefix}/include/python<version>
.RS
Recommended locations of the directories containing the include files
needed for developing Python extensions and embedding the
interpreter.
.RE
.IP \fI~/.pythonrc.py\fP
User-specific initialization file loaded by the \fIuser\fP module;
not used by default or by most applications.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP PYTHONHOME
Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By default, the
libraries are searched in ${prefix}/lib/python<version> and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>, where ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}
are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to
\fI/usr/local\fP.  When $PYTHONHOME is set to a single directory, its value
replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.  To specify different values
for these, set $PYTHONHOME to ${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.
.IP PYTHONPATH
Augments the default search path for module files.
The format is the same as the shell's $PATH: one or more directory
pathnames separated by colons.
Non-existent directories are silently ignored.
The default search path is installation dependent, but generally
begins with ${prefix}/lib/python<version> (see PYTHONHOME above).
The default search path is always appended to $PYTHONPATH.
If a script argument is given, the directory containing the script is
inserted in the path in front of $PYTHONPATH.
The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program as the
variable
.I sys.path .
.IP PYTHONSTARTUP
If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that
file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive
mode.
The file is executed in the same name space where interactive commands
are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be used
without qualification in the interactive session.
You can also change the prompts
.I sys.ps1
and
.I sys.ps2
in this file.
.IP PYTHONY2K
Set this to a non-empty string to cause the \fItime\fP module to
require dates specified as strings to include 4-digit years, otherwise
2-digit years are converted based on rules described in the \fItime\fP
module documentation.
.IP PYTHONOPTIMIZE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-O\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-O\fP multiple times.
.IP PYTHONDEBUG
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-d\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-d\fP multiple times.
.IP PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-B\fP option (don't try to write
.I .py[co]
files).
.IP PYTHONINSPECT
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-i\fP option.
.IP PYTHONNOUSERSITE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-s\fP option (Don't add the user site directory to sys.path).
.IP PYTHONUNBUFFERED
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-u\fP option.
.IP PYTHONVERBOSE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-v\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-v\fP multiple times. 
.IP PYTHONHASHSEED
If this variable is set to "random", the effect is the same as specifying
the \fB-R\fP option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of str,
bytes and datetime objects.

If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for
generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.  Its
purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the
interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash
values.

The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].  Specifying
the value 0 will lead to the same hash values as when hash randomization is
disabled.
.SH INTERACTIVE INPUT EDITING AND HISTORY SUBSTITUTION
The Python inteterpreter supports editing of the current input line and
history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn shell and
the GNU Bash shell.
However, rather than being implemented using the GNU Readline library, this
Python interpreter uses the BSD EditLine library
.BR editline (3)
with a GNU Readline emulation layer.
.PP
The
.I readline
module provides the access to the EditLine library, but there are a few major
differences compared to a traditional implementation using the Readline library.
The command language used in the preference files is that of EditLine,
as described in
.BR editrc (5)
and not that used by the Readline library.
This also means that the
.IR parse_and_bind ()
routines uses EditLine commands.
And the preference file itself is
.I ~/.editrc
instead of
.IR ~/.inputrc .
.PP
For example, the
.I rlcompleter
module, which defines a completion function for the
.I readline
modules, works correctly with the EditLine libraries, but needs to be
initialized somewhat differently:
.IP
import rlcompleter
.br
import readline
.br
readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^I rl_complete")
.PP
For
.I vi
mode, one needs:
.IP
readline.parse_and_bind("bind -v")

.SH DESCRIPTION
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
For an introduction to programming in Python, see the Python Tutorial.
The Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types,
constants, functions and modules.
Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and
semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.
(These documents may be located via the
.B "INTERNET RESOURCES"
below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
.PP
Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in
C or C++.
On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.
Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing
applications.
See the internal documentation for hints.
.PP
Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be 
viewed by running the 
.B pydoc
program.  
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
Don't write
.I .py[co]
files on import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.
.TP
.BI "\-c " command
Specify the command to execute (see next section).
This terminates the option list (following options are passed as
arguments to the command).
.TP
.B \-d
Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on
compilation options).
.TP
.B \-E
Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that modify
the behavior of the interpreter.
.TP
.B \-h ", " \-? ", "\-\-help
Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.
.TP
.B \-i
When a script is passed as first argument or the \fB\-c\fP option is
used, enter interactive mode after executing the script or the
command.  It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can be
useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script
raises an exception.
.TP
.BI "\-m " module-name
Searches 
.I sys.path 
for the named module and runs the corresponding 
.I .py 
file as a script.
.TP
.B \-O
Turn on basic optimizations.  This changes the filename extension for
compiled (bytecode) files from
.I .pyc
to \fI.pyo\fP.  Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.
.TP
.B \-OO
Discard docstrings in addition to the \fB-O\fP optimizations.
.TP
.B \-R
Turn on "hash randomization", so that the hash() values of str, bytes and
datetime objects are "salted" with an unpredictable pseudo-random value.
Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are
not predictable between repeated invocations of Python.
.IP
This is intended to provide protection against a denial of service
caused by carefully-chosen inputs that exploit the worst case performance
of a dict construction, O(n^2) complexity.  See
http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html
for details.
.TP
.BI "\-Q " argument
Division control; see PEP 238.  The argument must be one of "old" (the
default, int/int and long/long return an int or long), "new" (new
division semantics, i.e. int/int and long/long returns a float),
"warn" (old division semantics with a warning for int/int and
long/long), or "warnall" (old division semantics with a warning for
all use of the division operator).  For a use of "warnall", see the
Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.
.TP
.B \-s
Don't add user site directory to sys.path.
.TP
.B \-S
Disable the import of the module
.I site
and the site-dependent manipulations of
.I sys.path
that it entails.
.TP
.B \-t
Issue a warning when a source file mixes tabs and spaces for
indentation in a way that makes it depend on the worth of a tab
expressed in spaces.  Issue an error when the option is given twice.
.TP
.B \-u
Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered.  On systems
where it matters, also put stdin, stdout and stderr in binary mode.
Note that there is internal buffering in xreadlines(), readlines() and
file-object iterators ("for line in sys.stdin") which is not
influenced by this option.  To work around this, you will want to use
"sys.stdin.readline()" inside a "while 1:" loop.
.TP
.B \-v
Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place
(filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded.  When given
twice, print a message for each file that is checked for when 
searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup
at exit.
.TP
.B \-V ", " \-\-version
Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.
.TP
.BI "\-W " argument
Warning control.  Python sometimes prints warning message to
.IR sys.stderr .
A typical warning message has the following form:
.IB file ":" line ": " category ": " message.
By default, each warning is printed once for each source line where it
occurs.  This option controls how often warnings are printed.
Multiple
.B \-W
options may be given; when a warning matches more than one
option, the action for the last matching option is performed.
Invalid
.B \-W
options are ignored (a warning message is printed about invalid
options when the first warning is issued).  Warnings can also be
controlled from within a Python program using the
.I warnings
module.

The simplest form of
.I argument
is one of the following
.I action
strings (or a unique abbreviation):
.B ignore
to ignore all warnings;
.B default
to explicitly request the default behavior (printing each warning once
per source line);
.B all
to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate many
messages if a warning is triggered repeatedly for the same source
line, such as inside a loop);
.B module
to print each warning only the first time it occurs in each
module;
.B once
to print each warning only the first time it occurs in the program; or
.B error
to raise an exception instead of printing a warning message.

The full form of
.I argument
is
.IB action : message : category : module : line.
Here,
.I action
is as explained above but only applies to messages that match the
remaining fields.  Empty fields match all values; trailing empty
fields may be omitted.  The
.I message
field matches the start of the warning message printed; this match is
case-insensitive.  The
.I category
field matches the warning category.  This must be a class name; the
match test whether the actual warning category of the message is a
subclass of the specified warning category.  The full class name must
be given.  The
.I module
field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this match is
case-sensitive.  The
.I line
field matches the line number, where zero matches all line numbers and
is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.
.TP
.B \-x
Skip the first line of the source.  This is intended for a DOS
specific hack only.  Warning: the line numbers in error messages will
be off by one!
.TP
.B \-3
Warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix.
.SH INTERPRETER INTERFACE
The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when
called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for
commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a
file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and
executes a
.I script
from that file;
when called with
.B \-c
.I command,
it executes the Python statement(s) given as
.I command.
Here
.I command
may contain multiple statements separated by newlines.
Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!
In non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is
executed.
.PP
If available, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are
passed to the script in the Python variable
.I sys.argv ,
which is a list of strings (you must first
.I import sys
to be able to access it).
If no script name is given,
.I sys.argv[0]
is an empty string; if
.B \-c
is used,
.I sys.argv[0]
contains the string
.I '-c'.
Note that options interpreted by the Python interpreter itself
are not placed in
.I sys.argv.
.PP
In interactive mode, the primary prompt is `>>>'; the second prompt
(which appears when a command is not complete) is `...'.
The prompts can be changed by assignment to
.I sys.ps1
or
.I sys.ps2.
The interpreter quits when it reads an EOF at a prompt.
When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is printed and
control returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the
interpreter exits after printing the stack trace.
The interrupt signal raises the
.I Keyboard\%Interrupt
exception; other UNIX signals are not caught (except that SIGPIPE is
sometimes ignored, in favor of the
.I IOError
exception).  Error messages are written to stderr.
.SH FILES AND DIRECTORIES
These are subject to difference depending on local installation
conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent
and should be interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same.
The default for both is \fI/usr/local\fP.
.IP \fI${exec_prefix}/bin/python\fP
Recommended location of the interpreter.
.PP
.I ${prefix}/lib/python<version>
.br
.I ${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>
.RS
Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard
modules.
.RE
.PP
.I ${prefix}/include/python<version>
.br
.I ${exec_prefix}/include/python<version>
.RS
Recommended locations of the directories containing the include files
needed for developing Python extensions and embedding the
interpreter.
.RE
.IP \fI~/.pythonrc.py\fP
User-specific initialization file loaded by the \fIuser\fP module;
not used by default or by most applications.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP PYTHONHOME
Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By default, the
libraries are searched in ${prefix}/lib/python<version> and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>, where ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}
are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to
\fI/usr/local\fP.  When $PYTHONHOME is set to a single directory, its value
replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.  To specify different values
for these, set $PYTHONHOME to ${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.
.IP PYTHONPATH
Augments the default search path for module files.
The format is the same as the shell's $PATH: one or more directory
pathnames separated by colons.
Non-existent directories are silently ignored.
The default search path is installation dependent, but generally
begins with ${prefix}/lib/python<version> (see PYTHONHOME above).
The default search path is always appended to $PYTHONPATH.
If a script argument is given, the directory containing the script is
inserted in the path in front of $PYTHONPATH.
The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program as the
variable
.I sys.path .
.IP PYTHONSTARTUP
If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that
file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive
mode.
The file is executed in the same name space where interactive commands
are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be used
without qualification in the interactive session.
You can also change the prompts
.I sys.ps1
and
.I sys.ps2
in this file.
.IP PYTHONY2K
Set this to a non-empty string to cause the \fItime\fP module to
require dates specified as strings to include 4-digit years, otherwise
2-digit years are converted based on rules described in the \fItime\fP
module documentation.
.IP PYTHONOPTIMIZE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-O\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-O\fP multiple times.
.IP PYTHONDEBUG
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-d\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-d\fP multiple times.
.IP PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-B\fP option (don't try to write
.I .py[co]
files).
.IP PYTHONINSPECT
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-i\fP option.
.IP PYTHONIOENCODING
If this is set before running the interpreter, it overrides the encoding used
for stdin/stdout/stderr, in the syntax
.IB encodingname ":" errorhandler
The
.IB errorhandler
part is optional and has the same meaning as in str.encode. For stderr, the
.IB errorhandler
 part is ignored; the handler will always be \'backslashreplace\'.
.IP PYTHONNOUSERSITE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the
\fB\-s\fP option (Don't add the user site directory to sys.path).
.IP PYTHONUNBUFFERED
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-u\fP option.
.IP PYTHONVERBOSE
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the \fB\-v\fP option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to
specifying \fB\-v\fP multiple times. 
.IP PYTHONWARNINGS
If this is set to a comma-separated string it is equivalent to
specifying the \fB\-W\fP option for each separate value.
.IP PYTHONHASHSEED
If this variable is set to "random", the effect is the same as specifying
the \fB-R\fP option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of str,
bytes and datetime objects.

If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for
generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.  Its
purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the
interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash
values.

The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].  Specifying
the value 0 will lead to the same hash values as when hash randomization is
disabled.
.SH INTERACTIVE INPUT EDITING AND HISTORY SUBSTITUTION
The Python inteterpreter supports editing of the current input line and
history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn shell and
the GNU Bash shell.
However, rather than being implemented using the GNU Readline library, this
Python interpreter uses the BSD EditLine library
.BR editline (3)
with a GNU Readline emulation layer.
.PP
The
.I readline
module provides the access to the EditLine library, but there are a few major
differences compared to a traditional implementation using the Readline library.
The command language used in the preference files is that of EditLine,
as described in
.BR editrc (5)
and not that used by the Readline library.
This also means that the
.IR parse_and_bind ()
routines uses EditLine commands.
And the preference file itself is
.I ~/.editrc
instead of
.IR ~/.inputrc .
.PP
For example, the
.I rlcompleter
module, which defines a completion function for the
.I readline
modules, works correctly with the EditLine libraries, but needs to be
initialized somewhat differently:
.IP
import rlcompleter
.br
import readline
.br
readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^I rl_complete")
.PP
For
.I vi
mode, one needs:
.IP
readline.parse_and_bind("bind -v")

.Sh NAME
.Nm python ,

.Nd an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm python
.Ar ...
.Nm pythonw
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
To support multiple versions, the programs named
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
select the real version of Python to run, depending on various
settings.
The current supported versions are
.Sy 2.6
and
.Sy 2.7 ,
with the default being
.Sy 2.7 .
Use
.Pp
.Dl % man python2.6
.Dl % man python2.7
.Dl % man pythonw2.6
.Dl % man pythonw2.7
.Pp
to see the man page for a specific version.
Without a version specified these will show the man page for the (unmodified) default
version of Python
.Sy ( 2.7 ) .
To see the man page for a specific version of pydoc, for example, use
.Pp
.Dl % man pydoc2.6
.Sh CHANGING THE DEFAULT PYTHON
Using
.Pp
.Dl % defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.6
.Pp
will make version
.Sy 2.6
the user default when running both the
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
commands
.Sy ( versioner
is the internal name of the version-selection software used).
.Pp
The environment variable
.Ev VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION
can also be used to set the
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
version:
.Pp
.D1 Li % export VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=2.6 Em # Bourne-like shells
.D1 Li "    " Sy or
.D1 Li % setenv VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION 2.6 Em # C-like shells
.Dl % python ...
.Pp
This environment variable takes precedence over the preference file settings.
.Sh USING A SPECIFIC VERSION
Rather than using the
.Nm python
command, one can use a specific version directly.
For example, running
.Nm python2.6
from the command line will run the
.Sy 2.6
version of Python.
.Pp
One can use a specific version of Python on the
.Em #!
line of a script, but that may have portability and future compatibility issues.
.Pp
Note that the preference files and environment variables that apply to the
.Nm python
command do
.Sy not
apply when running a specific version of Python.
In particular, running
.Nm python2.6
will always default to 64-bit execution
(unless one uses the
.Xr arch 1
command to specifically select a 32-bit architecture).

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to run python scripts that may display a graphical user interface (GUI).
Pass the same arguments to
.Nm
as you would to
.Xr python 1 .
For executable scripts, use
.Nm
in the "#!" line.
.Pp
Actually, since Python 2.5, the normal
.Nm python
also allows GUI access, so
.Nm python
and
.Nm pythonw
are now interchangeable.

.Dt qtmodernizer 1
.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME 
.Nm qtmodernizer

.Nd Tool to convert legacy movies to modern format with minimal changes.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options ...
.Ar pathToSource
.Ar [pathToDestination]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command line tool to examine a media file which may be in a legacy format or may contain legacy media tracks. In this case a legacy format is one which cannot be read directly by CoreMedia or AVFoundation frameworks.
.Pp
.Nm 
examines all the tracks to determine if they are all in a form that can currently be played. If all tracks are playable and the format is readable, 
.Nm
does returns and does nothing. If any of the audio or video tracks are encoded with a codec that CoreMedia does not support, that track will be converted to a modern format, usually H.264 for video and AAC for audio (see --useprores for other choices).
.Pp
.It pathToSource must be a file path to a source media file or a directory. The file can be almost any modern or legacy media format. If pathToSource is a directory, then all files in the directory will be modernized.
.It [pathToDestination] must be directory path or a full file path. If pathToDirectory is not specified, the directory of the source file will be used. If the path is to a directory, the name of created file will be the same as the source with "-modernized" added to the name. The created file will be a QuickTime movie (.mov) file. If no output file is specified, a file will be created in the same directory as the source with "-modernized" appended to the title.
.Pp
Command line options of qtmodernizer:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl h | \-help
.It Fl p | \-useprores
If -p or --useprores is specified,
.Nm
will use the ProRes video codec and LPCM audio codec instead of H.264 and AAC-LC. For video tracks it will produce AppleProRes422. For audio it will produce uncompressed output (lpcm). Tracks outher than audio or video are not re-encoded and will not be affected. Either AppleProRes422 may be chosen or the AppleProRes4444 option may be chosen but not both.
.It Fl p4 | \-useprores4444
If -p4 or --useprores4444 is specified,
.Nm
will use the ProRes4444 video codec and LPCM audio codec instead of H.264 and AAC-LC. For video tracks it will produce AppleProRes4444. For audio it will produce uncompressed output (lpcm). Tracks outher than audio or video are not re-encoded and will not be affected. Either AppleProRes4444 may be chosen or the AppleProRes422 option may be chosen but not both.
.It Fl r | \-replace
Normally
.Nm 
will not replace any existing files. If --replace is specified, a file already existing at the destination path will be replaced by the new output. 
.Nm
will not replace the file at original source path used in the command.
.It Fl v | \-verbose
Normally 
.Nm
only displays important error or warning messages. Specifying --verbose causes other information about the modernization to be displayed on the command line. --infoonly implies --verbose.
.It Fl i | \-infoonly
Causes
.Nm 
to display information about the tracks contained in the source file and what the modernization process would be for each track (if any) but does not actually produce an output file.
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
	qtmodernizer legacy_movie.mov modern_movie.mov
.Pp
Each legacy audio and video track would be re-encoded to a modern (H.264 or AAC) track with other tracks passed through. The resulting movie is saved as modern_movie.mov
.Pp
	qtmodernizer -p legacy_movie.mov modern_movie.mov
.Pp
Legacy audio and video tracks would be re-encoded like in the above example but the resulting codecs would be ProRes for video and LPCM for audio
.Pp
	qtmodernizer ~/Movies/legacy_movie.mov
.Pp
This command will create a modernized movie in the ~/Movies directory named "legacy_movie-modernized.mov"

.Ar user
.Nm quota
.Op Fl g

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quota
displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
.Pp
Options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group 
of which the user is a member.
The optional
.Fl u
flag is equivalent to the default.
.It Fl v
.Nm quota
will display quotas on filesystems
where no storage is allocated.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on filesystems where usage is over quota.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
displays both the user quotas and the group quotas (for
the user).
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl u
flag and the optional
.Ar user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the
.Fl g
flag and optional
.Ar group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.Pp
The
.Fl q
flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.Pp
.Nm Quota
reports the quotas of all the filesystems that have
a mount option file located at its root.
If
.Nm quota
exits with a non-zero status, then one or more filesystems
are over quota.
.Sh FILES
Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
mounted filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files
whose existence indicates that quotas are to be enabled
for that filesystem.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width .quota.ops.group -compact
.It Pa .quota.user
data file containing user quotas
.It Pa .quota.group
data file containing group quotas
.It Pa .quota.ops.user

in addition to the files given in the \fB\-rand\fR option.  A new

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46p
.Ar source_file target_file
.Nm
.Op Fl 46pr
.Ar source_file
.Ar ...
.Ar target_directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies files between machines.
Each
.Ar source_file ,
.Ar target_file ,
or
.Ar target_directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form
.Dq ruser@rhost:path ,
or a local file name (containing no
.Ql :\&
characters,
or a
.Ql /
before any
.Ql :\& Ns
s).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl p
Cause
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Xr umask 2 .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar target_file
are preserved if it already exists; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask 2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using
.Ql \e ,
.Ql \&" ,
or
.Ql \(aa )
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh 1 ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr rlogin 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr hosts.equiv 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Does not detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa .login ,
.Pa .profile ,
or
.Pa .cshrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
This file documents the GNU version of
.BR refer ,
which is part of the groff document formatting system.
.B refer
copies the contents of
.IR filename \|.\|.\|.\&
to the standard output,
except that lines between
.B .[
and
.B .]\&
are interpreted as citations,
and lines between
.B .R1
and
.B .R2
are interpreted as commands about how citations are to be processed.
.
.LP
Each citation specifies a reference.
The citation can specify a reference that is contained in
a bibliographic database by giving a set of keywords
that only that reference contains.
Alternatively it can specify a reference by supplying a database
record in the citation.
A combination of these alternatives is also possible.
.
.LP
For each citation,
.B refer
can produce a mark in the text.
This mark consists of some label which can be separated from
the text and from other labels in various ways.
For each reference it also outputs
.B groff
commands that can be used by a macro package to produce a formatted
reference for each citation.
The output of
.B refer
must therefore be processed using a suitable macro package.
The
.B \-ms
and
.B \-me
macros are both suitable.
The commands to format a citation's reference can be output immediately after
the citation,
or the references may be accumulated,
and the commands output at some later point.
If the references are accumulated, then multiple citations of the same
reference will produce a single formatted reference.
.
.LP
The interpretation of lines between
.B .R1
and
.B .R2
as commands is a new feature of GNU
.BR refer .
Documents making use of this feature can still be processed by
Unix refer just by adding the lines
.
.RS
.LP
.nf
.ft B
\&.de R1
\&.ig R2
\&..
.ft
.fi
.RE
.
to the beginning of the document.
This will cause
.B troff
to ignore everything between
.B .R1
and
.BR .R2 .
The effect of some commands can also be achieved by options.
These options are supported mainly for compatibility with Unix refer.
It is usually more convenient to use commands.
.
.LP
.B refer
generates
.B .lf
lines so that filenames and line numbers in messages produced
by commands that read
.B refer
output will be correct;
it also interprets lines beginning with
.B .lf
so that filenames and line numbers in the messages and
.B .lf
lines that it produces will be accurate even if the input has been
preprocessed by a command such as
.BR soelim (1).
.

These options are equivalent to the following commands with the
addition that the filenames specified on the command line are
processed as if they were arguments to the

The following options have no equivalent commands:
.

Print the version number.
.
.TP
.B \-R
Don't recognize lines beginning with
.BR .R1 / .R2 .

.
.SH USAGE
.
.
.SS Bibliographic databases
The bibliographic database is a text file consisting of records
separated by one or more blank lines.
Within each record fields start with a
.B %
at the beginning of a line.
Each field has a one character name that immediately follows the
.BR % .
It is best to use only upper and lower case letters for the names
of fields.
The name of the field should be followed by exactly one space,
and then by the contents of the field.
Empty fields are ignored.
The conventional meaning of each field is as follows:
.
.TP
.B A
The name of an author.
If the name contains a title such as
.B Jr.\&
at the end,
it should be separated from the last name by a comma.
There can be multiple occurrences of the
.B A
field.
The order is significant.
It is a good idea always to supply an
.B A
field or a
.B Q
field.
.
.TP
.B B
For an article that is part of a book, the title of the book.
.
.TP
.B C
The place (city) of publication.
.
.TP
.B D
The date of publication.
The year should be specified in full.
If the month is specified, the name rather than the number of the month
should be used, but only the first three letters are required.
It is a good idea always to supply a
.B D
field;
if the date is unknown, a value such as
.B in press
or
.B unknown
can be used.
.
.TP
.B E
For an article that is part of a book, the name of an editor of the book.
Where the work has editors and no authors,
the names of the editors should be given as
.B A
fields and
.B ,\ (ed)
or
.B ,\ (eds)
should be appended to the last author.
.
.TP
.B G
US Government ordering number.
.
.TP
.B I
The publisher (issuer).
.
.TP
.B J
For an article in a journal, the name of the journal.
.
.TP
.B K
Keywords to be used for searching.
.
.TP
.B L
Label.
.
.TP
.B N
Journal issue number.
.
.TP
.B O
Other information.
This is usually printed at the end of the reference.
.
.TP
.B P
Page number.
A range of pages can be specified as
.IB m \- n\fR.
.
.TP
.B Q
The name of the author, if the author is not a person.
This will only be used if there are no
.B A
fields.
There can only be one
.B Q
field.
.
.TP
.B R
Technical report number.
.
.TP
.B S
Series name.
.
.TP
.B T
Title.
For an article in a book or journal,
this should be the title of the article.
.
.TP
.B V
Volume number of the journal or book.
.
.TP
.B X
Annotation.
.
.LP
For all fields except
.B A
and
.BR E ,
if there is more than one occurrence of a particular field in a record,
only the last such field will be used.
.
.LP
If accent strings are used, they should follow the character to be accented.
This means that the
.B AM
macro must be used with the
.B \-ms
macros.
Accent strings should not be quoted:
use one
.B \e
rather than two.
.

.SS Citations
The format of a citation is
.
.RS
.BI .[ opening-text
.br
.I "flags keywords"
.br
.I fields
.br
.BI .] closing-text
.RE
.
.LP
The
.IR opening-text ,
.IR closing-text
and
.I flags
components are optional.
Only one of the
.I keywords
and
.I fields
components need be specified.
.
.LP
The
.I keywords
component says to search the bibliographic databases for a reference
that contains all the words in
.IR keywords .
It is an error if more than one reference if found.
.
.LP
The
.I fields
components specifies additional fields to replace or supplement
those specified in the reference.
When references are being accumulated and the
.I keywords
component is non-empty,
then additional fields should be specified only on the first
occasion that a particular reference is cited,
and will apply to all citations of that reference.
.

component specifies strings to be used to bracket the label instead
of the strings specified in the
.B bracket-label
command.
If either of these components is non-empty,
the strings specified in the
.B bracket-label
command will not be used;
this behaviour can be altered using the
.B [
and
.B ]
flags.
Note that leading and trailing spaces are significant for these components.
.
.LP
The
.I flags
component is a list of
non-alphanumeric characters each of which modifies the treatment
of this particular citation.
Unix refer will treat these flags as part of the keywords and
so will ignore them since they are non-alphanumeric.
The following flags are currently recognized:
.
.TP
.B #
This says to use the label specified by the
.B short-label
command,
instead of that specified by the
.B label
command.
If no short label has been specified, the normal label will be used.
Typically the short label is used with author-date labels
and consists of only the date and possibly a disambiguating letter;
the
.B #
is supposed to be suggestive of a numeric type of label.
.
.TP
.B [
Precede
.I opening-text
with the first string specified in the
.B bracket-label
command.
.
.TP
.B ]
Follow
.I closing-text
with the second string specified in the
.B bracket-label
command.
.
.LP
One advantages of using the
.B [
and
.B ]
flags rather than including the brackets in
.I opening-text
and
.I closing-text
is that
you can change the style of bracket used in the document just by changing the
.B bracket-label
command.
Another advantage is that sorting and merging of citations
will not necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.
.
.LP
If a label is to be inserted into the text,
it will be attached to the line preceding the
.B .[
line.
If there is no such line, then an extra line will be inserted before the
.B .[
line and a warning will be given.
.
.LP
There is no special notation for making a citation to multiple references.
Just use a sequence of citations, one for each reference.
Don't put anything between the citations.
The labels for all the citations will be attached to the line preceding
the first citation.
The labels may also be sorted or merged.
See the description of the
.B <>
label expression, and of the
.B sort-adjacent-labels
and
.B abbreviate-label-ranges
command.
A label will not be merged if its citation has a non-empty
.I opening-text
or
.IR closing-text .
However, the labels for a citation using the
.B ]
flag and without any
.I closing-text
immediately followed by a citation using the
.B [
flag and without any
.I opening-text
may be sorted and merged
even though the first citation's
.I opening-text
or the second citation's
.I closing-text
is non-empty.
(If you wish to prevent this just make the first citation's
.I closing-text
.BR \e& .)
.
.
.SS Commands
Commands are contained between lines starting with
.B .R1
and
.BR .R2 .
Recognition of these lines can be prevented by the
.B \-R
option.
When a
.B .R1
line is recognized any accumulated references are flushed out.
Neither
.B .R1
nor
.B .R2
lines,
nor anything between them
is output.
.
.LP
Commands are separated by newlines or
.BR ; s.
.B #
introduces a comment that extends to the end of the line
(but does not conceal the newline).
Each command is broken up into words.
Words are separated by spaces or tabs.
A word that begins with
.B \(ts
extends to the next
.B \(ts
that is not followed by another
.BR \(ts .
If there is no such
.B \(ts
the word extends to the end of the line.
Pairs of
.B \(ts
in a word beginning with
.B \(ts
collapse to a single
.BR \(ts .
Neither
.B #
nor
.B ;
are recognized inside
.BR \(ts s.
A line can be continued by ending it with
.BR \e ;
this works everywhere except after a
.BR # .
.
.LP
.ds n \fR*
Each command
.I name
that is marked with \*n has an associated negative command
.BI no- name
that undoes the effect of
.IR name .
For example, the
.B no-sort
command specifies that references should not be sorted.
The negative commands take no arguments.
.
.LP
In the following description each argument must be a single word;
.I field
is used for a single upper or lower case letter naming a field;
.I fields
is used for a sequence of such letters;
.I m
and
.I n
are used for a non-negative numbers;
.I string
is used for an arbitrary string;
.I filename
is used for the name of a file.
.
.Tp \w'\fBabbreviate-label-ranges'u+2n
.BI abbreviate\*n\  fields\ string1\ string2\ string3\ string4
Abbreviate the first names of
.IR fields .
An initial letter will be separated from another initial letter by
.IR string1 ,
from the last name by
.IR string2 ,
and from anything else
(such as a
.B von
or
.BR de )
by
.IR string3 .
These default to a period followed by a space.
In a hyphenated first name,
the initial of the first part of the name will be separated from the hyphen by
.IR string4 ;
this defaults to a period.
No attempt is made to handle any ambiguities that might
result from abbreviation.
Names are abbreviated before sorting and before
label construction.
.
.TP
.BI abbreviate-label-ranges\*n\  string
Three or more adjacent labels that refer to consecutive references
will be abbreviated to a label consisting
of the first label, followed by
.I string
followed by the last label.
This is mainly useful with numeric labels.
If
.I string
is omitted it defaults to
.BR \- .
.
.TP
.B accumulate\*n
Accumulate references instead of writing out each reference
as it is encountered.
Accumulated references will be written out whenever a reference
of the form
.
.RS
.IP
.B .[
.br
.B $LIST$
.br
.B .]
.
.LP
is encountered,
after all input files hve been processed,
and whenever
.B .R1
line is recognized.
.RE
.
.TP
.BI annotate\*n\  field\ string
.I field
is an annotation;
print it at the end of the reference as a paragraph preceded by the line
.
.RS
.IP
.BI . string
.
.LP
If
.I macro
is omitted it will default to
.BR AP ;
if
.I field
is also omitted it will default to
.BR X .
Only one field can be an annotation.
.RE
.
.TP
.BI articles\  string \fR\|.\|.\|.
.IR string \|.\|.\|.\&
are definite or indefinite articles, and should be ignored at the beginning of
.B T
fields when sorting.
Initially,
.BR the ,
.B a

.B an
are recognized as articles.
.
.TP
.BI bibliography\  filename \fR\|.\|.\|.
Write out all the references contained in the bibliographic databases
.IR filename \|.\|.\|.
This command should come last in a
.BR .R1 / .R2
block.
.
.TP
.BI bracket-label\  string1\ string2\ string3
In the text, bracket each label
with
.I string1
and
.IR string2 .
An occurrence of
.I string2
immediately followed by
.I string1
will be turned into
.IR string3 .
The default behaviour is
.
.RS
.IP
.B
bracket-label \e*([. \e*(.] ", "
.RE
.
.TP
.BI capitalize\  fields
Convert
.I fields
to caps and small caps.
.
.TP
.B compatible\*n
Recognize
.B .R1
and
.B .R2
even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
.
.TP
.BI database\  filename \fR\|.\|.\|.
Search the bibliographic databases
.IR filename \|.\|.\|.
For each
.I filename
if an index
.IB filename .i
created by
.BR indxbib (1)
exists, then it will be searched instead;
each index can cover multiple databases.
.
.TP
.BI date-as-label\*n\  string
.I string
is a label expression that specifies a string with which to replace the
.B D
field after constructing the label.
See the
.B "Label expressions"
subsection for a description of label expressions.
This command is useful if you do not want explicit labels in the
reference list, but instead want to handle any necessary
disambiguation by qualifying the date in some way.
The label used in the text would typically be some combination of the
author and date.
In most cases you should also use the
.B no-label-in-reference
command.
For example,
.
.RS
.IP
.B "date-as-label D.+yD.y%a*D.-y"
.
.LP
would attach a disambiguating letter to the year part of the
.B D
field in the reference.
.RE
.
.TP
.B default-database\*n
The default database should be searched.
This is the default behaviour, so the negative version of
this command is more useful.
.B refer
determines whether the default database should be searched
on the first occasion that it needs to do a search.
Thus a
.B no-default-database
command must be given before then,
in order to be effective.
.
.TP
.BI discard\*n\  fields
When the reference is read,
.I fields
should be discarded;
no string definitions for
.I fields
will be output.
Initially,
.I fields
are
.BR XYZ .
.
.TP
.BI et-al\*n\  string\ m\ n
Control use of
.B "et al"
in the evaluation of
.B @
expressions in label expressions.
If the number of authors needed to make the author sequence
unambiguous is
.I u
and the total number of authors is
.I t
then the last
.IR t \|\-\| u
authors will be replaced by
.I string
provided that
.IR t \|\-\| u
is not less than
.I m
and
.I t
is not less than
.IR n .
The default behaviour is
.
.RS
.IP
.B
et-al " et al" 2 3
.RE
.
.TP
.BI include\  filename
Include
.I filename
and interpret the contents as commands.
.
.TP
.BI join-authors\  string1\ string2\ string3
This says how authors should be joined together.
When there are exactly two authors, they will be joined with
.IR string1 .
When there are more than two authors, all but the last two will
be joined with
.IR string2 ,
and the last two authors will be joined with
.IR string3 .
If
.I string3
is omitted,
it will default to
.IR string1 ;
if
.I string2
is also omitted it will also default to
.IR string1 .
For example,
.
.RS
.IP
.B
join-authors " and " ", " ", and "
.
.LP
will restore the default method for joining authors.
.RE
.
.TP
.B label-in-reference\*n
When outputting the reference,
define the string
.B [F
to be the reference's label.
This is the default behaviour; so the negative version
of this command is more useful.
.
.TP
.B label-in-text\*n
For each reference output a label in the text.
The label will be separated from the surrounding text as described in the
.B bracket-label
command.
This is the default behaviour; so the negative version
of this command is more useful.
.
.TP
.BI label\  string
.I string
is a label expression describing how to label each reference.
.
.TP
.BI separate-label-second-parts\  string
When merging two-part labels, separate the second part of the second
label from the first label with
.IR string .
See the description of the
.B <>
label expression.
.
.TP
.B move-punctuation\*n
In the text, move any punctuation at the end of line past the label.
It is usually a good idea to give this command unless you are using
superscripted numbers as labels.
.
.TP
.BI reverse\*n\  string
Reverse the fields whose names
are in
.IR string .
Each field name can be followed by a number which says
how many such fields should be reversed.
If no number is given for a field, all such fields will be reversed.
.
.TP
.BI search-ignore\*n\  fields
While searching for keys in databases for which no index exists,
ignore the contents of
.IR fields .
Initially, fields
.B XYZ
are ignored.
.
.TP
.BI search-truncate\*n\  n
Only require the first
.I n
characters of keys to be given.
In effect when searching for a given key
words in the database are truncated to the maximum of
.I n
and the length of the key.
Initially
.I n
is\ 6.
.
.TP
.BI short-label\*n\  string
.I string
is a label expression that specifies an alternative (usually shorter)
style of label.
This is used when the
.B #
flag is given in the citation.
When using author-date style labels, the identity of the author
or authors is sometimes clear from the context, and so it
may be desirable to omit the author or authors from the label.
The
.B short-label
command will typically be used to specify a label containing just
a date and possibly a disambiguating letter.
.
.TP
.BI sort\*n\  string
Sort references according to
.BR string .
References will automatically be accumulated.
.I string
should be a list of field names, each followed by a number,
indicating how many fields with the name should be used for sorting.
.B +
can be used to indicate that all the fields with the name should be used.
Also
.B .\&
can be used to indicate the references should be sorted using the
(tentative) label.
(The
.B "Label expressions"
subsection describes the concept of a tentative label.)
.
.TP
.B sort-adjacent-labels\*n
Sort labels that are adjacent in the text according to their
position in the reference list.
This command should usually be given if the
.B abbreviate-label-ranges
command has been given,
or if the label expression contains a
.B <>
expression.
This will have no effect unless references are being accumulated.
.
.
.SS Label expressions
.
.LP
Label expressions can be evaluated both normally and tentatively.
The result of normal evaluation is used for output.
The result of tentative evaluation, called the
.IR "tentative label" ,
is used to gather the information
that normal evaluation needs to disambiguate the label.
Label expressions specified by the
.B date-as-label
and
.B short-label
commands are not evaluated tentatively.
Normal and tentative evaluation are the same for all types
of expression other than
.BR @ ,
.BR * ,
and
.B %
expressions.
The description below applies to normal evaluation,
except where otherwise specified.
.
.TP
.I field
.TQ
.I field\ n
The
.IR n -th
part of
.IR field .
If
.I n
is omitted, it defaults to\ 1.
.
.TP
.BI ' string '
The characters in
.I string
literally.
.
.TP
.B @
All the authors joined as specified by the
.B join-authors
command.
The whole of each author's name will be used.
However, if the references are sorted by author
(that is the sort specification starts with
.BR A+ ),
then authors' last names will be used instead, provided that this does
not introduce ambiguity,
and also an initial subsequence of the authors may be used
instead of all the authors, again provided that this does not
introduce ambiguity.
The use of only the last name for the
.IR i -th
author of some reference
is considered to be ambiguous if
there is some other reference,
such that the first
.IR i \|-\|1
authors of the references are the same,
the
.IR i -th
authors are not the same,
but the
.IR i -th
authors' last names are the same.
A proper initial subsequence of the sequence
of authors for some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is
a reference with some other sequence of authors which also has
that subsequence as a proper initial subsequence.
When an initial subsequence of authors is used, the remaining
authors are replaced by the string specified by the
.B et-al
command;
this command may also specify additional requirements that must be
met before an initial subsequence can be used.
.B @
tentatively evaluates to a canonical representation of the authors,
such that authors that compare equally for sorting purpose
will have the same representation.
.
.TP
.BI % n
.TQ
.B %a
.TQ
.B %A
.TQ
.B %i
.TQ
.B %I
The serial number of the reference formatted according to the character
following the
.BR % .
The serial number of a reference is\ 1 plus the number of earlier references
with same tentative label as this reference.
These expressions tentatively evaluate to an empty string.
.
.TP
.IB expr *
If there is another reference with the same tentative label as
this reference, then
.IR expr ,
otherwise an empty string.
It tentatively evaluates to an empty string.
.
.TP
.IB expr + n
.TQ
.IB expr \- n
The first
.RB ( + )
or last
.RB ( \- )
.I n
upper or lower case letters or digits of
.IR expr .
Troff special characters (such as
.BR \e('a )
count as a single letter.
Accent strings are retained but do not count towards the total.
.
.TP
.IB expr .l
.I expr
converted to lowercase.
.
.TP
.IB expr .u
.I expr
converted to uppercase.

.IB expr .c
.I expr
converted to caps and small caps.
.
.TP
.IB expr .r
.I expr
reversed so that the last name is first.
.
.TP
.IB expr .a
.I expr
with first names abbreviated.
Note that fields specified in the
.B abbreviate
command are abbreviated before any labels are evaluated.
Thus
.B .a
is useful only when you want a field to be abbreviated in a label
but not in a reference.
.
.TP
.IB expr .y
The year part of
.IR expr .
.
.TP
.IB expr .+y
The part of
.I expr
before the year, or the whole of
.I expr
if it does not contain a year.
.
.TP
.IB expr .\-y
The part of
.I expr
after the year, or an empty string if
.I expr
does not contain a year.
.
.TP
.IB expr .n
The last name part of
.IR expr .
.
.TP
.IB expr1 \(ti expr2
.I expr1
except that if the last character of
.I expr1
is
.B \-
then it will be replaced by
.IR expr2 .
.
.TP
.I expr1\ expr2
The concatenation of
.I expr1
and
.IR expr2 .
.
.TP
.IB expr1 | expr2
If
.I expr1
is non-empty then
.I expr1
otherwise
.IR expr2 .

.TP
.IB expr1 & expr2
If
.I expr1
is non-empty
then
.I expr2
otherwise an empty string.

.IB expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
If
.I expr1
is non-empty
then
.I expr2
otherwise
.IR expr3 .
.
.TP
.BI < expr >
The label is in two parts, which are separated by
.IR expr .
Two adjacent two-part labels which have the same first part will be
merged by appending the second part of the second label onto the first
label separated by the string specified in the
.B separate-label-second-parts
command (initially, a comma followed by a space); the resulting label
will also be a two-part label with the same first part as before
merging, and so additional labels can be merged into it.
Note that it is permissible for the first part to be empty;
this maybe desirable for expressions used in the
.B short-label
command.
.
.TP
.BI ( expr )
The same as
.IR expr .
Used for grouping.
.
.LP
The above expressions are listed in order of precedence
(highest first);
.B &
and
.B |
have the same precedence.
.
.
.SS Macro interface
Each reference starts with a call to the macro
.BR ]- .
The string
.B [F
will be defined to be the label for this reference,
unless the
.B no-label-in-reference
command has been given.
There then follows a series of string definitions,
one for each field:
string
.BI [ X
corresponds to field
.IR X .
The number register
.B [P
is set to\ 1 if the
.B P
field contains a range of pages.
The
.BR [T ,
.B [A
and
.B [O
number registers are set to\ 1 according as the
.BR T ,
.B A
and
.B O
fields end with one of the characters
.BR .?! .
The
.B [E
number register will be set to\ 1 if the
.B [E
string contains more than one name.
The reference is followed by a call to the
.B ][
macro.
The first argument to this macro gives a number representing
the type of the reference.
If a reference contains a
.B J
field, it will be classified as type\ 1,
otherwise if it contains a
.B B
field, it will type\ 3,
otherwise if it contains a
.B G
or
.B R
field it will be type\ 4,
otherwise if contains a
.B I
field it will be type\ 2,
otherwise it will be type\ 0.
The second argument is a symbolic name for the type:
.BR other ,
.BR journal-article ,
.BR book ,
.B article-in-book
or
.BR tech-report .
Groups of references that have been accumulated
or are produced by the
.B bibliography
command are preceded by a call to the
.B ]<
macro and followed by a call to the
.B ]>
macro.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBreq\fR command primarily creates and processes certificate requests
in PKCS#10 format. It can additionally create self signed certificates
for use as root CAs for example.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded
form compatible with the PKCS#10. The \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR form is the default format: it
consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64 encoded with additional header and
footer lines.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a request from or standard input
if this option is not specified. A request is only read if the creation
options (\fB\-new\fR and \fB\-newkey\fR) are not specified.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the input file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
default.
.IP "\fB\-passout arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passout arg"
the output file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the certificate request in text form.
.IP "\fB\-pubkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubkey"
outputs the public key.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the request.
.IP "\fB\-modulus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modulus"
this option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key
contained in the request.
.IP "\fB\-verify\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify"
verifies the signature on the request.
.IP "\fB\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-new"
this option generates a new certificate request. It will prompt
the user for the relevant field values. The actual fields
prompted for and their maximum and minimum sizes are specified
in the configuration file and any requested extensions.
.Sp
If the \fB\-key\fR option is not used it will generate a new \s-1RSA\s0 private
key using information specified in the configuration file.
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.IP "\fB\-newkey arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-newkey arg"
this option creates a new certificate request and a new private
key. The argument takes one of two forms. \fBrsa:nbits\fR, where
\&\fBnbits\fR is the number of bits, generates an \s-1RSA\s0 key \fBnbits\fR
in size. \fBdsa:filename\fR generates a \s-1DSA\s0 key using the parameters
in the file \fBfilename\fR.
.IP "\fB\-key filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-key filename"
This specifies the file to read the private key from. It also
accepts PKCS#8 format private keys for \s-1PEM\s0 format files.
.IP "\fB\-keyform PEM|DER\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyform PEM|DER"
the format of the private key file specified in the \fB\-key\fR
argument. \s-1PEM\s0 is the default.
.IP "\fB\-keyout filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyout filename"
this gives the filename to write the newly created private key to.
If this option is not specified then the filename present in the
configuration file is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodes"
if this option is specified then if a private key is created it
will not be encrypted.
.IP "\fB\-[md5|sha1|md2|mdc2]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-[md5|sha1|md2|mdc2]"
this specifies the message digest to sign the request with. This
overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.
This option is ignored for \s-1DSA\s0 requests: they always use \s-1SHA1.\s0
.IP "\fB\-config filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-config filename"
this allows an alternative configuration file to be specified,
this overrides the compile time filename or any specified in
the \fB\s-1OPENSSL_CONF\s0\fR environment variable.
.IP "\fB\-subj arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-subj arg"
sets subject name for new request or supersedes the subject name
when processing a request.
The arg must be formatted as \fI/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\fR,
characters may be escaped by \e (backslash), no spaces are skipped.
.IP "\fB\-multivalue\-rdn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-multivalue-rdn"
this option causes the \-subj argument to be interpreted with full
support for multivalued RDNs. Example:
.Sp
\&\fI/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe\fR
.Sp
If \-multi\-rdn is not used then the \s-1UID\s0 value is \fI123456+CN=John Doe\fR.
.IP "\fB\-x509\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x509"
this option outputs a self signed certificate instead of a certificate
request. This is typically used to generate a test certificate or
a self signed root \s-1CA.\s0 The extensions added to the certificate
(if any) are specified in the configuration file. Unless specified
using the \fBset_serial\fR option \fB0\fR will be used for the serial
number.
.IP "\fB\-days n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-days n"
when the \fB\-x509\fR option is being used this specifies the number of
days to certify the certificate for. The default is 30 days.
.IP "\fB\-set_serial n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-set_serial n"
serial number to use when outputting a self signed certificate. This
may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value if preceded by \fB0x\fR.
It is possible to use negative serial numbers but this is not recommended.
.IP "\fB\-extensions section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-extensions section"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-reqexts section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-reqexts section"
.PD
these options specify alternative sections to include certificate
extensions (if the \fB\-x509\fR option is present) or certificate
request extensions. This allows several different sections to
be used in the same configuration file to specify requests for
a variety of purposes.
.IP "\fB\-utf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-utf8"
this option causes field values to be interpreted as \s-1UTF8\s0 strings, by 
default they are interpreted as \s-1ASCII.\s0 This means that the field
values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a
configuration file, must be valid \s-1UTF8\s0 strings.
.IP "\fB\-nameopt option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nameopt option"
option which determines how the subject or issuer names are displayed. The
\&\fBoption\fR argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by
commas.  Alternatively the \fB\-nameopt\fR switch may be used more than once to
set multiple options. See the \fIx509\fR\|(1) manual page for details.
.IP "\fB\-asn1\-kludge\fR" 4
.IX Item "-asn1-kludge"
by default the \fBreq\fR command outputs certificate requests containing
no attributes in the correct PKCS#10 format. However certain CAs will only
accept requests containing no attributes in an invalid form: this
option produces this invalid format.
.Sp
More precisely the \fBAttributes\fR in a PKCS#10 certificate request
are defined as a \fB\s-1SET OF\s0 Attribute\fR. They are \fBnot \s-1OPTIONAL\s0\fR so
if no attributes are present then they should be encoded as an
empty \fB\s-1SET OF\s0\fR. The invalid form does not include the empty
\&\fB\s-1SET OF\s0\fR whereas the correct form does.
.Sp
It should be noted that very few CAs still require the use of this option.
.IP "\fB\-newhdr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-newhdr"
Adds the word \fB\s-1NEW\s0\fR to the \s-1PEM\s0 file header and footer lines on the outputed
request. Some software (Netscape certificate server) and some CAs need this.
.IP "\fB\-batch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-batch"
non-interactive mode.
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
print extra details about the operations being performed.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
The configuration options are specified in the \fBreq\fR section of
the configuration file. As with all configuration files if no
value is specified in the specific section (i.e. \fBreq\fR) then
the initial unnamed or \fBdefault\fR section is searched too.
.PP
The options available are described in detail below.
.IP "\fBinput_password output_password\fR" 4
.IX Item "input_password output_password"
The passwords for the input private key file (if present) and
the output private key file (if one will be created). The
command line options \fBpassin\fR and \fBpassout\fR override the
configuration file values.
.IP "\fBdefault_bits\fR" 4
.IX Item "default_bits"
This specifies the default key size in bits. If not specified then
512 is used. It is used if the \fB\-new\fR option is used. It can be
overridden by using the \fB\-newkey\fR option.
.IP "\fBdefault_keyfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "default_keyfile"
This is the default filename to write a private key to. If not
specified the key is written to standard output. This can be
overridden by the \fB\-keyout\fR option.
.IP "\fBoid_file\fR" 4
.IX Item "oid_file"
This specifies a file containing additional \fB\s-1OBJECT IDENTIFIERS\s0\fR.
Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the
object identifier followed by white space then the short name followed
by white space and finally the long name.
.IP "\fBoid_section\fR" 4
.IX Item "oid_section"
This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers. Each line should consist of the short name of the
object identifier followed by \fB=\fR and the numerical form. The short
and long names are the same when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\s-1RANDFILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "RANDFILE"
This specifies a filename in which random number seed information is
placed and read from, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
It is used for private key generation.
.IP "\fBencrypt_key\fR" 4
.IX Item "encrypt_key"
If this is set to \fBno\fR then if a private key is generated it is
\&\fBnot\fR encrypted. This is equivalent to the \fB\-nodes\fR command line
option. For compatibility \fBencrypt_rsa_key\fR is an equivalent option.
.IP "\fBdefault_md\fR" 4
.IX Item "default_md"
This option specifies the digest algorithm to use. Possible values
include \fBmd5 sha1 mdc2\fR. If not present then \s-1MD5\s0 is used. This
option can be overridden on the command line.
.IP "\fBstring_mask\fR" 4
.IX Item "string_mask"
This option masks out the use of certain string types in certain
fields. Most users will not need to change this option.
.Sp
It can be set to several values \fBdefault\fR which is also the default
option uses PrintableStrings, T61Strings and BMPStrings if the 
\&\fBpkix\fR value is used then only PrintableStrings and BMPStrings will
be used. This follows the \s-1PKIX\s0 recommendation in \s-1RFC2459.\s0 If the
\&\fButf8only\fR option is used then only UTF8Strings will be used: this
is the \s-1PKIX\s0 recommendation in \s-1RFC2459\s0 after 2003. Finally the \fBnombstr\fR
option just uses PrintableStrings and T61Strings: certain software has
problems with BMPStrings and UTF8Strings: in particular Netscape.
.IP "\fBreq_extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "req_extensions"
this specifies the configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to the certificate request. It can be overridden
by the \fB\-reqexts\fR command line switch.
.IP "\fBx509_extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "x509_extensions"
this specifies the configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to certificate generated when the \fB\-x509\fR switch
is used. It can be overridden by the \fB\-extensions\fR command line switch.
.IP "\fBprompt\fR" 4
.IX Item "prompt"
if set to the value \fBno\fR this disables prompting of certificate fields
and just takes values from the config file directly. It also changes the
expected format of the \fBdistinguished_name\fR and \fBattributes\fR sections.
.IP "\fButf8\fR" 4
.IX Item "utf8"
if set to the value \fByes\fR then field values to be interpreted as \s-1UTF8\s0
strings, by default they are interpreted as \s-1ASCII.\s0 This means that
the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a
configuration file, must be valid \s-1UTF8\s0 strings.
.IP "\fBattributes\fR" 4
.IX Item "attributes"
this specifies the section containing any request attributes: its format
is the same as \fBdistinguished_name\fR. Typically these may contain the
challengePassword or unstructuredName types. They are currently ignored
by OpenSSL's request signing utilities but some CAs might want them.
.IP "\fBdistinguished_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "distinguished_name"
This specifies the section containing the distinguished name fields to
prompt for when generating a certificate or certificate request. The format
is described in the next section.
.SH "DISTINGUISHED NAME AND ATTRIBUTE SECTION FORMAT"
.IX Header "DISTINGUISHED NAME AND ATTRIBUTE SECTION FORMAT"
There are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute
sections. If the \fBprompt\fR option is set to \fBno\fR then these sections
just consist of field names and values: for example,
.PP
.Vb 3
\& CN=My Name
\& OU=My Organization
\& emailAddress=someone@somewhere.org
.Ve
.PP
This allows external programs (e.g. \s-1GUI\s0 based) to generate a template file
with all the field names and values and just pass it to \fBreq\fR. An example
of this kind of configuration file is contained in the \fB\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\fR section.
.PP
Alternatively if the \fBprompt\fR option is absent or not set to \fBno\fR then the
file contains field prompting information. It consists of lines of the form:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& fieldName="prompt"
\& fieldName_default="default field value"
\& fieldName_min= 2
\& fieldName_max= 4
.Ve
.PP
\&\*(L"fieldName\*(R" is the field name being used, for example commonName (or \s-1CN\s0).
The \*(L"prompt\*(R" string is used to ask the user to enter the relevant
details. If the user enters nothing then the default value is used if no
default value is present then the field is omitted. A field can
still be omitted if a default value is present if the user just
enters the '.' character.
.PP
The number of characters entered must be between the fieldName_min and
fieldName_max limits: there may be additional restrictions based
on the field being used (for example countryName can only ever be
two characters long and must fit in a PrintableString).
.PP
Some fields (such as organizationName) can be used more than once
in a \s-1DN.\s0 This presents a problem because configuration files will
not recognize the same name occurring twice. To avoid this problem
if the fieldName contains some characters followed by a full stop
they will be ignored. So for example a second organizationName can
be input by calling it \*(L"1.organizationName\*(R".
.PP
The actual permitted field names are any object identifier short or
long names. These are compiled into OpenSSL and include the usual
values such as commonName, countryName, localityName, organizationName,
organizationUnitName, stateOrProvinceName. Additionally emailAddress
is include as well as name, surname, givenName initials and dnQualifier.
.PP
Additional object identifiers can be defined with the \fBoid_file\fR or
\&\fBoid_section\fR options in the configuration file. Any additional fields
will be treated as though they were a DirectoryString.

.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The header and footer lines in the \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR format are normally:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END CERTIFICATE REQUEST\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
some software (some versions of Netscape certificate server) instead needs:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
which is produced with the \fB\-newhdr\fR option but is otherwise compatible.
Either form is accepted transparently on input.
.PP
The certificate requests generated by \fBXenroll\fR with \s-1MSIE\s0 have extensions
added. It includes the \fBkeyUsage\fR extension which determines the type of
key (signature only or general purpose) and any additional OIDs entered
by the script in an extendedKeyUsage extension.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
The following messages are frequently asked about:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        Using configuration from /some/path/openssl.cnf
\&        Unable to load config info
.Ve
.PP
This is followed some time later by...
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        unable to find \*(Aqdistinguished_name\*(Aq in config
\&        problems making Certificate Request
.Ve
.PP
The first error message is the clue: it can't find the configuration
file! Certain operations (like examining a certificate request) don't
need a configuration file so its use isn't enforced. Generation of
certificates or requests however does need a configuration file. This
could be regarded as a bug.
.PP
Another puzzling message is this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        Attributes:
\&            a0:00
.Ve
.PP
this is displayed when no attributes are present and the request includes
the correct empty \fB\s-1SET OF\s0\fR structure (the \s-1DER\s0 encoding of which is 0xa0
0x00). If you just see:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Attributes:
.Ve
.PP
then the \fB\s-1SET OF\s0\fR is missing and the encoding is technically invalid (but
it is tolerated). See the description of the command line option \fB\-asn1\-kludge\fR
for more information.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The variable \fB\s-1OPENSSL_CONF\s0\fR if defined allows an alternative configuration
file location to be specified, it will be overridden by the \fB\-config\fR command
line switch if it is present. For compatibility reasons the \fB\s-1SSLEAY_CONF\s0\fR
environment variable serves the same purpose but its use is discouraged.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
OpenSSL's handling of T61Strings (aka TeletexStrings) is broken: it effectively
treats them as \s-1ISO\-8859\-1 \s0(Latin 1), Netscape and \s-1MSIE\s0 have similar behaviour.
This can cause problems if you need characters that aren't available in
PrintableStrings and you don't want to or can't use BMPStrings.
.PP
As a consequence of the T61String handling the only correct way to represent
accented characters in OpenSSL is to use a BMPString: unfortunately Netscape
currently chokes on these. If you have to use accented characters with Netscape
and \s-1MSIE\s0 then you currently need to use the invalid T61String form.
.PP
The current prompting is not very friendly. It doesn't allow you to confirm what
you've just entered. Other things like extensions in certificate requests are
statically defined in the configuration file. Some of these: like an email
address in subjectAltName should be input by the user.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtput\fR utility uses the \fBterminfo\fR database to make the
values of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
the shell (see \fBsh\fR(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or
return the long name of the requested terminal type.
The result depends upon the capability's type:
.RS
.TP 5
string
\fBtput\fR writes the string to the standard output.
No trailing newline is supplied.
.TP
integer
\fBtput\fR writes the decimal value to the standard output,
with a trailing newline.
.TP
boolean
\fBtput\fR simply sets the exit code
(\fB0\fR for TRUE if the terminal has the capability,
\fB1\fR for FALSE if it does not),
and writes nothing to the standard output.
.RE
.PP
Before using a value returned on the standard output,
the application should test the exit code
(e.g., \fB$?\fR, see \fBsh\fR(1)) to be sure it is \fB0\fR.
(See the \fBEXIT CODES\fR and \fBDIAGNOSTICS\fR sections.)
For a complete list of capabilities
and the \fIcapname\fR associated with each, see \fBterminfo\fR(5).
.TP
\fB-T\fR\fItype\fR
indicates the \fItype\fR of terminal.  Normally this option is
unnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment
variable \fBTERM\fR.  If \fB-T\fR is specified, then the shell
variables \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR will be ignored,and the
operating system will not be queried for the actual screen size.
.TP
\fIcapname\fR
indicates the capability from the \fBterminfo\fR database.  When
\fBtermcap\fR support is compiled in, the \fBtermcap\fR name for
the capability is also accepted.
.TP
\fIparms\fR
If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the arguments
\fIparms\fR will be instantiated into the string.
.IP
Most parameters are numbers.
Only a few terminfo capabilities require string parameters;
\fBtput\fR uses a table to decide which to pass as strings.
Normally \fBtput\fR uses \fBtparm\fR (3X) to perform the substitution.
If no parameters are given for the capability,
\fBtput\fR writes the string without performing the substitution.
.TP
\fB-S\fR
allows more than one capability per invocation of \fBtput\fR.  The
capabilities must be passed to \fBtput\fR from the standard input
instead of from the command line (see example).
Only one \fIcapname\fR is allowed per line.
The \fB-S\fR option changes the
meaning of the \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR boolean and string exit codes (see the
EXIT CODES section).
.IP
Again, \fBtput\fR uses a table and the presence of parameters in its input
to decide whether to use \fBtparm\fR (3X),
and how to interpret the parameters.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.TP
\fBinit\fR
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the user's
terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR, above), the following will
occur:
.RS
.TP
(1)
if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be
output as detailed in the \fBterminfo\fR(5) section on
.IR "Tabs and Initialization" ,
.TP
(2)
any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry will
be set in the tty driver,
.TP
(3)
tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to
the specification in the entry, and
.TP
(4)
if tabs are not expanded,
standard tabs will be set (every 8 spaces).
.RE
.IP
If an entry does not
contain the information needed for any of the four above activities,
that activity will silently be skipped.
.TP
\fBreset\fR
Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal's
reset strings will be output if present (\fBrs1\fR, \fBrs2\fR, \fBrs3\fR, \fBrf\fR).
If the reset strings are not present, but initialization
strings are, the initialization strings will be output.
Otherwise, \fBreset\fR acts identically to \fBinit\fR.
.TP
\fBlongname\fR
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the
user's terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR above), then the long name
of the terminal will be put out.  The long name is the last
name in the first line of the terminal's description in the
\fBterminfo\fR database [see \fBterm\fR(5)].
.PP
If \fBtput\fR is invoked by a link named \fBreset\fR, this has the
same effect as \fBtput reset\fR.
See \fBtset\fR for comparison, which has similar behavior.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
\fBtput init\fR
Initialize the terminal according to the type of
terminal in the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR.  This
command should be included in everyone's .profile after
the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR has been exported, as
illustrated on the \fBprofile\fR(5) manual page.
.TP 5
\fBtput -T5620 reset\fR
Reset an AT&T 5620 terminal, overriding the type of
terminal in the environmental variable \fBTERM\fR.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup 0 0\fR
Send the sequence to move the cursor to row \fB0\fR, column \fB0\fR
(the upper left corner of the screen, usually known as the "home"
cursor position).
.TP 5
\fBtput clear\fR
Echo the clear-screen sequence for the current terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput cols\fR
Print the number of columns for the current terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput -T450 cols\fR
Print the number of columns for the 450 terminal.
.TP 5
\fBbold=`tput smso` offbold=`@TPUT@ rmso`\fR
Set the shell variables \fBbold\fR, to begin stand-out mode
sequence, and \fBoffbold\fR, to end standout mode sequence,
for the current terminal.  This might be followed by a
prompt: \fBecho "${bold}Please type in your name: ${offbold}\\c"\fR
.TP 5
\fBtput hc\fR
Set exit code to indicate if the current terminal is a hard copy terminal.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup 23 4\fR
Send the sequence to move the cursor to row 23, column 4.
.TP 5
\fBtput cup\fR
Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement, with no parameters substituted.

\&
This example shows \fBtput\fR processing several capabilities in one invocation.
It clears the screen,
moves the cursor to position 10, 10
and turns on bold (extra bright) mode.
The list is terminated by an exclamation mark (\fB!\fR) on a line by itself.
.SH FILES

tab settings for some terminals, in a format
appropriate to be output to the terminal (escape
sequences that set margins and tabs); for more
information, see the "Tabs and Initialization"
section of \fBterminfo\fR(5)
.SH EXIT CODES
If the \fB-S\fR option is used,
\fBtput\fR checks for errors from each line,
and if any errors are found, will set the exit code to 4 plus the
number of lines with errors.
If no errors are found, the exit code is \fB0\fR.
No indication of which line failed can be given so
exit code \fB1\fR will never appear.  Exit codes \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, and
\fB4\fR retain their usual interpretation.
If the \fB-S\fR option is not used,
the exit code depends on the type of \fIcapname\fR:
.RS 5
.TP
.I boolean
a value of \fB0\fR is set for TRUE and \fB1\fR for FALSE.
.TP
.I string
a value of \fB0\fR is set if the
\fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR (the value of
\fIcapname\fR is returned on standard output);
a value of \fB1\fR is set if \fIcapname\fR
is not defined for this terminal \fItype\fR
(nothing is written to standard output).
.TP
.I integer
a value of \fB0\fR is always set,
whether or not \fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR.
To determine if \fIcapname\fR is defined for this terminal \fItype\fR,
the user must test the value written to standard output.
A value of \fB-1\fR
means that \fIcapname\fR is not defined for this terminal \fItype\fR.
.TP
.I other
\fBreset\fR or \fBinit\fR may fail to find their respective files.
In that case, the exit code is set to 4 + \fBerrno\fR.
.RE
.PP
Any other exit code indicates an error; see the DIAGNOSTICS section.

.SH PORTABILITY
.PP
The \fBlongname\fR and \fB-S\fR options, and the parameter-substitution
features used in the \fBcup\fR example, are not supported in BSD curses or in
AT&T/USL curses before SVr4.
.PP
X/Open documents only the operands for \fBclear\fP, \fBinit\fP and \fBreset\fP.
In this implementation, \fBclear\fP is part of the \fIcapname\fR support.
Other implementations of \fBtput\fP on
SVr4-based systems such as Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX
as well as others such as AIX and Tru64
provide support for \fIcapname\fR operands.
A few platforms such as FreeBSD and NetBSD recognize termcap names rather
than terminfo capability names in their respective \fBtput\fP commands.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a CLI front end for the Ruby API reference.
You can search and read API reference for classes and methods with
.Nm .
.Pp
.Nm
is a part of Ruby.
.Pp
.Ar target
can be one of the following forms:
.Bl -diag -offset indent
.It Class
for classes
.It Class::method
for class methods
.It Class#method
for instance methods
.It Class.method
for both class and instance methods
.It method
for both class and instance methods
.El
.Pp
All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form. If a name
is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ri Fil
ri File
ri File.new
ri zip
.Ed
.Pp
Note that shell quoting may be required for method names containing
punctuation:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ri 'Array.[]'
ri compact\!
.Ed
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "1234567890123" -compact
.Pp
.It Fl -version

pager or tell the pager to allow control characters.
.Pp
.It Fl i
.It Fl -interactive
This makes
.Nm
go into interactive mode.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is in interactive mode it will allow the user to disambiguate lists of
methods in case multiple methods match against a method search string.  It also
will allow the user to enter in a method name (with auto-completion, if readline
is supported) when viewing a class.
.Pp
.It Fl -list-doc-dirs
List the directories from which ri will source documentation on stdout and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl -no-standard-docs

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar rlogin
.Op Fl 468DEd
.Op Fl e Ar char
.Op Fl i Ar localname
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Ar [username@]host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility starts a terminal session on a remote host
.Ar host .
.Pp
The standard Berkeley
.Pa rhosts
authorization mechanism is used.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl 8
Allow an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise
parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
characters are other than
^S/^Q.
.It Fl D
Set the TCP_NODELAY socket option which can improve interactive response
at the expense of increased network load.
.It Fl E
Stop any character from being recognized as an escape character.
When used with the
.Fl 8
option, this provides a completely transparent connection.
.It Fl d
Turn on socket debugging (see
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl e
Allow user specification of the escape character, which is
.Dq ~
by default.
This specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal
value in the form \ennn.
.It Fl i
Allow the caller to specify a different local name to be used
for authentication.
This option is restricted to processes with uid 0.
.It Fl l
Specify a different
.Ar username
for the remote login.
If this option is not specified, your local username will be used.
.El
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns \&.
disconnects from the remote host.
Similarly, the line
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns ^Z
will suspend the
.Nm
session, and
.Dq Ao escape\ char Ac Ns Ao delayed-suspend\ char Ac
suspends the
send portion of the
.Nm
session, but allows output from the remote system.
By default, the tilde
.Pq Dq ~
character is the escape character, and
normally control-Y
.Pq Dq ^Y
is the delayed-suspend character.
.Pp
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
the
.Nm
is transparent.
Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts
are handled properly.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rm ,
.Nm unlink
.Nd remove directory entries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfiPRrvW
.Ar
.Nm unlink
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on the
command line.
If the permissions of the file do not permit writing, and the standard
input device is a terminal, the user is prompted (on the standard error
output) for confirmation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.It Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i
options.
.It Fl i
Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of
the file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device is a
terminal.
The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f
options.
.It Fl P
Overwrite regular files before deleting them.
Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,
then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.
.It Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
The
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before
each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt
is made to remove the directory).
If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in
that directory is skipped.
.Pp
.It Fl r
Equivalent to
.Fl R .
.It Fl v
Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.
.It Fl W
Attempt to undelete the named files.
Currently, this option can only be used to recover
files covered by whiteouts.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the links.
.Pp
It is an error to attempt to remove the files
.Dq .\&
or
.Dq .. .
.Pp
When the utility is called as
.Nm unlink ,
only one argument,
which must not be a directory,
may be supplied.
No options may be supplied in this simple mode of operation,
which performs an
.Xr unlink 2
operation on the passed argument.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies were removed,
or if the
.Fl f
option was specified and all of the existing files or file hierarchies were
removed.
If an error occurs,
.Nm
exits with a value >0.
.Sh NOTE
The
.Nm
command uses
.Xr getopt 3
to parse its arguments, which allows it to accept
the
.Sq Li --
option which will cause it to stop processing flag options at that
point.  This will allow the removal of file names that begin
with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
For example:
.Dl rm -- -filename
The same behavior can be obtained by using an absolute or relative
path reference.  For example:
.Dl rm /home/user/-filename
.Dl rm ./-filename
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rmdir 1 ,
.Xr undelete 2 ,
.Xr unlink 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr getopt 3 ,
.Xr symlink 7
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl P
option assumes that the underlying file system is a fixed-block file
system.  In addition, only regular files are overwritten, other types of files
are not.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
utility differs from historical implementations in that the
.Fl f
option only masks attempts to remove non-existent files instead of
masking a large variety of errors.
The
.Fl v
option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.
.Pp
Also, historical
.Bx
implementations prompted on the standard output,
not the standard error output.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is almost
.St -p1003.2
compatible, except that
.Tn POSIX
requires
.Nm
to act like
.Xr rmdir 1
when the
.Ar file
specified is a directory.  This implementation requires the
.Fl d
option if such behavior is desired.  This follows the historical
behavior of
.Nm
with respect to directories.
.Pp
The simplified
.Nm unlink
command conforms to
.St -susv2 .

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p
.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility removes the directory entry specified by
each
.Ar directory
argument, provided it is empty.
.Pp
Arguments are processed in the order given.
In order to remove both a parent directory and a subdirectory
of that parent, the subdirectory
must be specified first so the parent directory
is empty when
.Nm
tries to remove it.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Each
.Ar directory
argument is treated as a pathname of which all
components will be removed, if they are empty,
starting with the last most component.
(See
.Xr rm 1
for fully non-discriminant recursive removal.)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Li \&0
Each directory entry specified by a dir operand
referred to an empty directory and was removed
successfully.
.It Li \&>\&0
An error occurred.

.Nm
.Oo
.Fl Oo Cm csCS Oc Ns Op Ar x
.Oo Cm kKgGw Oc Ns Op Ar N
.Cm tTeEnyjhHmz
.Oc
.Op Ar rows Op Ar cols
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the standard input, interpreting each line as a row
of blank-separated entries in an array,
transforms the array according to the options,
and writes it on the standard output.
With no arguments it transforms stream input into a columnar
format convenient for terminal viewing.
.Pp
The shape of the input array is deduced from the number of lines
and the number of columns on the first line.
If that shape is inconvenient, a more useful one might be
obtained by skipping some of the input with the
.Fl k
option.
Other options control interpretation of the input columns.
.Pp
The shape of the output array is influenced by the
.Ar rows
and
.Ar cols
specifications, which should be positive integers.
If only one of them is a positive integer,
.Nm
computes a value for the other which will accommodate
all of the data.
When necessary, missing data are supplied in a manner
specified by the options and surplus data are deleted.
There are options to control presentation of the output columns,
including transposition of the rows and columns.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ns Ar x
Input columns are delimited by the single character
.Ar x .
A missing
.Ar x
is taken to be `^I'.
.It Fl s Ns Ar x
Like
.Fl c ,
but maximal strings of
.Ar x
are delimiters.
.It Fl C Ns Ar x
Output columns are delimited by the single character
.Ar x .
A missing
.Ar x
is taken to be `^I'.
.It Fl S Ns Ar x
Like
.Fl C ,
but padded strings of
.Ar x
are delimiters.
.It Fl t
Fill in the rows of the output array using the columns of the
input array, that is, transpose the input while honoring any
.Ar rows
and
.Ar cols
specifications.
.It Fl T
Print the pure transpose of the input, ignoring any
.Ar rows
or
.Ar cols
specification.
.It Fl k Ns Ar N
Ignore the first
.Ar N
lines of input.
.It Fl K Ns Ar N
Like
.Fl k ,
but print the ignored lines.
.It Fl g Ns Ar N
The gutter width (inter-column space), normally 2, is taken to be
.Ar N .
.It Fl G Ns Ar N
The gutter width has
.Ar N
percent of the maximum column width added to it.
.It Fl e
Consider each line of input as an array entry.
.It Fl n
On lines having fewer entries than the first line,
use null entries to pad out the line.
Normally, missing entries are taken from the next line of input.
.It Fl y
If there are too few entries to make up the output dimensions,
pad the output by recycling the input from the beginning.
Normally, the output is padded with blanks.
.It Fl h
Print the shape of the input array and do nothing else.
The shape is just the number of lines and the number of
entries on the first line.
.It Fl H
Like
.Fl h ,
but also print the length of each line.
.It Fl j
Right adjust entries within columns.
.It Fl w Ns Ar N
The width of the display, normally 80, is taken to be the positive
integer
.Ar N .
.It Fl m
Do not trim excess delimiters from the ends of the output array.
.It Fl z
Adapt column widths to fit the largest entries appearing in them.
.El
.Pp
With no arguments,
.Nm
transposes its input, and assumes one array entry per input line
unless the first non-ignored line is longer than the display width.
Option letters which take numerical arguments interpret a missing
number as zero unless otherwise indicated.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm
utility can be used as a filter to convert the stream output
of certain programs (e.g.,
.Xr spell 1 ,
.Xr du 1 ,
.Xr file 1 ,
.Xr look 1 ,
.Xr nm 1 ,
.Xr who 1 ,
and
.Xr wc 1 )
into a convenient ``window'' format, as in
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% who | rs
.Ed
.Pp
This function has been incorporated into the
.Xr ls 1
program, though for most programs with similar output
.Nm
suffices.
.Pp
To convert stream input into vector output and back again, use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% rs 1 0 | rs 0 1
.Ed
.Pp
A 10 by 10 array of random numbers from 1 to 100 and
its transpose can be generated with
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% jot \-r 100 | rs 10 10 | tee array | rs \-T > tarray
.Ed
.Pp
In the editor
.Xr vi 1 ,
a file consisting of a multi-line vector with 9 elements per line
can undergo insertions and deletions,
and then be neatly reshaped into 9 columns with
.Bd -literal -offset indent
:1,$!rs 0 9
.Ed
.Pp
Finally, to sort a database by the first line of each 4-line field, try
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% rs \-eC 0 4 | sort | rs \-c 0 1
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr jot 1 ,
.Xr pr 1 ,
.Xr sort 1 ,
.Xr vi 1
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -item
.It
Handles only two dimensional arrays.
.It
The algorithm currently reads the whole file into memory,
so files that do not fit in memory will not be reshaped.
.It
Fields cannot be defined yet on character positions.
.It
Re-ordering of columns is not yet possible.
.It
There are too many options.
.It
Multibyte characters are not recognized.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBrsa\fR command processes \s-1RSA\s0 keys. They can be converted between various
forms and their components printed out. \fBNote\fR this command uses the
traditional SSLeay compatible format for private key encryption: newer
applications should use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the \fBpkcs8\fR
utility.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|NET|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|NET|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded
form compatible with the PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey or SubjectPublicKeyInfo format.
The \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR form is the default format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64
encoded with additional header and footer lines. On input PKCS#8 format private
keys are also accepted. The \fB\s-1NET\s0\fR form is a format is described in the \fB\s-1NOTES\s0\fR
section.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|NET|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|NET|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be
prompted for.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the input file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output if this
option is not specified. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase
will be prompted for. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same as the input
filename.
.IP "\fB\-passout password\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passout password"
the output file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-sgckey\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sgckey"
use the modified \s-1NET\s0 algorithm used with some versions of Microsoft \s-1IIS\s0 and \s-1SGC\s0
keys.
.IP "\fB\-aes128|\-aes192|\-aes256|\-camellia128|\-camellia192|\-camellia256|\-des|\-des3|\-idea\fR" 4
.IX Item "-aes128|-aes192|-aes256|-camellia128|-camellia192|-camellia256|-des|-des3|-idea"
These options encrypt the private key with the specified
cipher before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.
If none of these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This
means that using the \fBrsa\fR utility to read in an encrypted key with no
encryption option can be used to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by
setting the encryption options it can be use to add or change the pass phrase.
These options can only be used with \s-1PEM\s0 format output files.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the various public or private key components in
plain text in addition to the encoded version.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.
.IP "\fB\-modulus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modulus"
this option prints out the value of the modulus of the key.
.IP "\fB\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-check"
this option checks the consistency of an \s-1RSA\s0 private key.
.IP "\fB\-pubin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubin"
by default a private key is read from the input file: with this
option a public key is read instead.
.IP "\fB\-pubout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubout"
by default a private key is output: with this option a public
key will be output instead. This option is automatically set if
the input is a public key.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The \s-1PEM\s0 private key format uses the header and footer lines:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1PEM\s0 public key format uses the header and footer lines:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN PUBLIC KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END PUBLIC KEY\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\s-1NET\s0\fR form is a format compatible with older Netscape servers
and Microsoft \s-1IIS \s0.key files, this uses unsalted \s-1RC4\s0 for its encryption.
It is not very secure and so should only be used when necessary.
.PP
Some newer version of \s-1IIS\s0 have additional data in the exported .key
files. To use these with the utility, view the file with a binary editor
and look for the string \*(L"private-key\*(R", then trace back to the byte
sequence 0x30, 0x82 (this is an \s-1ASN1 SEQUENCE\s0). Copy all the data
from this point onwards to another file and use that as the input
to the \fBrsa\fR utility with the \fB\-inform \s-1NET\s0\fR option. If you get
an error after entering the password try the \fB\-sgckey\fR option.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
To remove the pass phrase on an \s-1RSA\s0 private key:
.PP
.Vb 1

\& openssl rsa \-in key.pem \-pubout \-out pubkey.pem
.Ve
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"

The \fBrsautl\fR command can be used to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt
data using the \s-1RSA\s0 algorithm.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read data from or standard input
if this option is not specified.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
default.
.IP "\fB\-inkey file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inkey file"
the input key file, by default it should be an \s-1RSA\s0 private key.
.IP "\fB\-pubin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubin"
the input file is an \s-1RSA\s0 public key.
.IP "\fB\-certin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-certin"
the input is a certificate containing an \s-1RSA\s0 public key.
.IP "\fB\-sign\fR" 4

The PKCS#1 block formatting is evident from this. If this was done using
encrypt and decrypt the block would have been of type 2 (the second byte)
and random padding data visible instead of the 0xff bytes.
.PP
It is possible to analyse the signature of certificates using this
utility in conjunction with \fBasn1parse\fR. Consider the self signed
example in certs/pca\-cert.pem . Running \fBasn1parse\fR as follows yields:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl asn1parse \-in pca\-cert.pem

The final \s-1BIT STRING\s0 contains the actual signature. It can be extracted with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl asn1parse \-in pca\-cert.pem \-out sig \-noout \-strparse 614

The certificate public key can be extracted with:
.PP

This is the parsed version of an \s-1ASN1\s0 DigestInfo structure. It can be seen that
the digest used was md5. The actual part of the certificate that was signed can
be extracted with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl asn1parse \-in pca\-cert.pem \-out tbs \-noout \-strparse 4
.Ve
.PP
and its digest computed with:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& openssl md5 \-c tbs
\& MD5(tbs)= f3:46:9e:aa:1a:4a:73:c9:37:ea:93:00:48:25:08:b5

.PP
which it can be seen agrees with the recovered value above.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rsh
.Nd remote shell
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46dn
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Ar host
.Op command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes
.Ar command
on
.Ar host .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard
output of the remote command to its standard output, and the
standard error of the remote command to its standard error.
Interrupt, quit and terminate signals are propagated to the remote
command;
.Nm
normally terminates when the remote command does.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl d
Turn on socket debugging (using
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the
.Tn TCP
sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl l Ar username
Allow the remote
.Ar username
to be specified.
By default, the remote username is the same as the local username.
Authorization is determined
as in
.Xr rlogin 1 .
.It Fl n
Redirect input from the special device
.Pa /dev/null
(see the
.Sx BUGS
section of this manual page).
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Allow a
.Ar timeout
to be specified (in seconds).
If no
data is sent or received in this time,
.Nm
will exit.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar command
is specified, you will be logged in on the remote host using
.Xr rlogin 1 .
.Pp
Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on local machine,
while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine.
For example, the command
.Pp
.Dl rsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile
.Pp
appends the remote file
.Ar remotefile
to the local file
.Ar localfile ,
while
.Pp
.Dl rsh otherhost cat remotefile \&">>\&" other_remotefile
.Pp
appends
.Ar remotefile
to
.Ar other_remotefile .
.\" .Pp
.\" Many sites specify a large number of host names as commands in the
.\" directory /usr/hosts.
.\" If this directory is included in your search path, you can use the
.\" shorthand ``host command'' for the longer form ``rsh host command''.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
If you are using
.Xr csh 1
and put a
.Nm
in the background without redirecting its input away from the terminal,
it will block even if no reads are posted by the remote command.
If no input is desired you should redirect the input of
.Nm
to
.Pa /dev/null
using the
.Fl n
option.
.Pp
You cannot run an interactive command
(like
.Xr ee 1
or
.Xr vi 1 )
using
.Nm ;
use
.Xr rlogin 1
instead.
.Pp
Stop signals stop the local
.Nm
process only; this is arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons
too complicated to explain here.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
files and to do system management tasks (like in Perl).  It is simple,
straight-forward, and extensible.
.Pp
If you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you
don't like the Perl ugliness, or you do like the concept of LISP, but
don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of
choice.
.Sh FEATURES
Ruby's features are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Sy "Interpretive"
Ruby is an interpreted language, so you don't have to recompile
programs written in Ruby to execute them.
.Pp
.It Sy "Variables have no type (dynamic typing)"
Variables in Ruby can contain data of any type.  You don't have to
worry about variable typing.  Consequently, it has a weaker compile
time check.
.Pp
.It Sy "No declaration needed"
You can use variables in your Ruby programs without any declarations.
Variable names denote their scope - global, class, instance, or local.
.Pp
.It Sy "Simple syntax"
Ruby has a simple syntax influenced slightly from Eiffel.
.Pp
.It Sy "No user-level memory management"
Ruby has automatic memory management.  Objects no longer referenced
from anywhere are automatically collected by the garbage collector
built into the interpreter.
.Pp
.It Sy "Everything is an object"
Ruby is a purely object-oriented language, and was so since its
creation.  Even such basic data as integers are seen as objects.
.Pp
.It Sy "Class, inheritance, and methods"
Being an object-oriented language, Ruby naturally has basic
features like classes, inheritance, and methods.
.Pp
.It Sy "Singleton methods"
Ruby has the ability to define methods for certain objects.  For
example, you can define a press-button action for certain widget by
defining a singleton method for the button.  Or, you can make up your
own prototype based object system using singleton methods, if you want
to.
.Pp
.It Sy "Mix-in by modules"
Ruby intentionally does not have the multiple inheritance as it is a
source of confusion.  Instead, Ruby has the ability to share
implementations across the inheritance tree.  This is often called a
.Sq Mix-in .
.Pp
.It Sy "Iterators"
Ruby has iterators for loop abstraction.
.Pp
.It Sy "Closures"
In Ruby, you can objectify the procedure.
.Pp
.It Sy "Text processing and regular expressions"
Ruby has a bunch of text processing features like in Perl.
.Pp
.It Sy "M17N, character set independent"
Ruby supports multilingualized programming. Easy to process texts
written in many different natural languages and encoded in many
different character encodings, without dependence on Unicode.
.Pp
.It Sy "Bignums"
With built-in bignums, you can for example calculate factorial(400).
.Pp
.It Sy "Reflection and domain specific languages"
Class is also an instance of the Class class. Definition of classes and methods
is an expression just as 1+1 is. So your programs can even write and modify programs.
Thus you can write your application in your own programming language on top of Ruby.
.Pp
.It Sy "Exception handling"
As in Java(tm).
.Pp
.It Sy "Direct access to the OS"
Ruby can use most
.Ux
system calls, often used in system programming.
.Pp
.It Sy "Dynamic loading"
On most
.Ux
systems, you can load object files into the Ruby interpreter
on-the-fly.
.It Sy "Rich libraries"
Libraries called "builtin libraries" and "standard libraries" are bundled with Ruby.
And you can obtain more libraries via the package management system called `RubyGems'.
.Pp
Moreover there are thousands of Ruby projects on GitHub
.Pf <\fBhttps://github.com/languages/Ruby\fR> Ns .
.El
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
Ruby interpreter accepts following command-line options (switches).
They are quite similar to those of
.Xr perl 1 .
.Bl -tag -width "1234567890123" -compact
.Pp
.It Fl -copyright
Prints the copyright notice.
.Pp
.It Fl -version
Prints the version of Ruby interpreter.
.Pp
.It Fl 0 Ns Op Ar octal
(The digit
.Dq zero . )
Specifies the input record separator
.Pf ( Li "$/" )
as an octal number. If no digit is given, the null character is taken
as the separator.  Other switches may follow the digits.
.Fl 00
turns Ruby into paragraph mode.
.Fl 0777
makes Ruby read whole file at once as a single string since there is
no legal character with that value.
.Pp
.It Fl C Ar directory
.It Fl X Ar directory
Causes Ruby to switch to the directory.
.Pp
.It Fl E Ar external Ns Op : Ns Ar internal
.It Fl -encoding Ar external Ns Op : Ns Ar internal
Specifies the default value(s) for external encodings and internal encoding. Values should be separated with colon (:).
.Pp
You can omit the one for internal encodings, then the value
.Pf ( Li "Encoding.default_internal" ) will be nil.
.Pp
.It Fl -external-encoding Ns = Ns Ar encoding
.It Fl -internal-encoding Ns = Ns Ar encoding
Specify the default external or internal character encoding
.Pp
.It Fl F Ar pattern
Specifies input field separator
.Pf ( Li "$;" ) .
.Pp
.It Fl I Ar directory
Used to tell Ruby where to load the library scripts.  Directory path
will be added to the load-path variable
.Pf ( Li "$:" ) .
.Pp
.It Fl K Ar kcode
Specifies KANJI (Japanese) encoding. The default value for script encodings
.Pf ( Li "__ENCODING__" ) and external encodings ( Li "Encoding.default_external" ) will be the specified one.
.Ar kcode
can be one of
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Sy e
EUC-JP
.Pp
.It Sy s
Windows-31J (CP932)
.Pp
.It Sy u
UTF-8
.Pp
.It Sy n
ASCII-8BIT (BINARY)
.El
.Pp
.It Fl S
Makes Ruby use the
.Ev PATH
environment variable to search for script, unless its name begins
with a slash.  This is used to emulate
.Li #!
on machines that don't support it, in the following manner:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /usr/local/bin/ruby
# This line makes the next one a comment in Ruby \e
  exec /usr/local/bin/ruby -S $0 $*
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl T Ns Op Ar level=1
Turns on taint checks at the specified level (default 1).
.Pp
.It Fl U
Sets the default value for internal encodings
.Pf ( Li "Encoding.default_internal" ) to UTF-8.
.Pp
.It Fl W Ns Op Ar level=2
Turns on verbose mode at the specified level without printing the version
message at the beginning. The level can be;
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Sy 0
Verbose mode is "silence". It sets the
.Li "$VERBOSE"
to nil.
.Pp
.It Sy 1
Verbose mode is "medium". It sets the
.Li "$VERBOSE"
to false.
.Pp
.It Sy 2 (default)
Verbose mode is "verbose". It sets the
.Li "$VERBOSE"
to true.
.Fl W Ns
2 is same as
.Fl w
.
.El
.Pp
.It Fl a
Turns on auto-split mode when used with
.Fl n
or
.Fl p .
In auto-split mode, Ruby executes
.Dl $F = $_.split
at beginning of each loop.
.Pp
.It Fl c
Causes Ruby to check the syntax of the script and exit without
executing. If there are no syntax errors, Ruby will print
.Dq Syntax OK
to the standard output.
.Pp
.It Fl d
.It Fl -debug
Turns on debug mode.
.Li "$DEBUG"
will be set to true.
.Pp
.It Fl e Ar command
Specifies script from command-line while telling Ruby not to search
the rest of the arguments for a script file name.
.Pp
.It Fl h
.It Fl -help
Prints a summary of the options.
.Pp
.It Fl i Ar extension
Specifies in-place-edit mode.  The extension, if specified, is added
to old file name to make a backup copy.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% echo matz > /tmp/junk
% cat /tmp/junk
matz
% ruby -p -i.bak -e '$_.upcase!' /tmp/junk
% cat /tmp/junk
MATZ
% cat /tmp/junk.bak
matz
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl l
(The lowercase letter
.Dq ell . )
Enables automatic line-ending processing, which means to firstly set
.Li "$\e"
to the value of
.Li "$/" ,
and secondly chops every line read using
.Li chop! .
.Pp
.It Fl n
Causes Ruby to assume the following loop around your script, which
makes it iterate over file name arguments somewhat like
.Nm sed
.Fl n
or
.Nm awk .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
while gets
  ...
end
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl p
Acts mostly same as -n switch, but print the value of variable
.Li "$_"
at the each end of the loop.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% echo matz | ruby -p -e '$_.tr! "a-z", "A-Z"'
MATZ
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl r Ar library
Causes Ruby to load the library using require.  It is useful when using
.Fl n
or
.Fl p .
.Pp
.It Fl s
Enables some switch parsing for switches after script name but before
any file name arguments (or before a
.Fl - ) .
Any switches found there are removed from
.Li ARGV
and set the corresponding variable in the script.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /usr/local/bin/ruby -s
# prints "true" if invoked with `-xyz' switch.
print "true\en" if $xyz
.Ed
.Pp
On some systems
.Li "$0"
does not always contain the full pathname, so you need the
.Fl S
switch to tell Ruby to search for the script if necessary (to handle embedded
spaces and such).  A better construct than
.Li "$*"
would be
.Li ${1+"$@"} ,
but it does not work if the script is being interpreted by
.Xr csh 1 .
.Pp
.It Fl v
Enables verbose mode.  Ruby will print its version at the beginning
and set the variable
.Li "$VERBOSE"
to true.  Some methods print extra messages if this variable is true.
If this switch is given, and no other switches are present, Ruby quits
after printing its version.
.Pp
.It Fl w
Enables verbose mode without printing version message at the
beginning.  It sets the
.Li "$VERBOSE"
variable to true.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ns Op Ar directory
Tells Ruby that the script is embedded in a message.  Leading garbage
will be discarded until the first line that starts with
.Dq #!
and contains the string,
.Dq ruby .
Any meaningful switches on that line will be applied.  The end of the script
must be specified with either
.Li EOF ,
.Li "^D" ( Li "control-D" ) ,
.Li "^Z" ( Li "control-Z" ) ,
or the reserved word
.Li __END__ .
If the directory name is specified, Ruby will switch to that directory
before executing script.
.Pp
.It Fl y
.It Fl -yydebug
DO NOT USE.
.Pp
Turns on compiler debug mode.  Ruby will print a bunch of internal
state messages during compilation.  Only specify this switch you are going to
debug the Ruby interpreter.
.Pp
.It Fl -disable- Ns Ar FEATURE
.It Fl -enable- Ns Ar FEATURE
Disables (or enables) the specified
.Ar FEATURE Ns
\&.
.Bl -tag -width "--disable-rubyopt" -compact
.It Fl -disable-gems
.It Fl -enable-gems
Disables (or enables) RubyGems libraries.  By default, Ruby will load the latest
version of each installed gem. The
.Li Gem
constant is true if RubyGems is enabled, false if otherwise.
.Pp
.It Fl -disable-rubyopt
.It Fl -enable-rubyopt
Ignores (or considers) the
.Ev RUBYOPT
environment variable. By default, Ruby considers the variable.
.Pp
.It Fl -disable-all
.It Fl -enable-all
Disables (or enables) all features.
.Pp
.El
.Pp
.It Fl -dump Ns = Ns Ar target
DO NOT USE.
.Pp
Prints the specified target.
.Ar target
can be one of;
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Sy insns
disassembled instructions
.Pp
.El
.Pp
Only specify this switch if you are going to debug the Ruby interpreter.
.Pp
.It Fl -verbose
Enables verbose mode without printing version message at the
beginning.  It sets the
.Li "$VERBOSE"
variable to true.
If this switch is given, and no other switches are present, Ruby quits
after printing its version.
.El
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "RUBYLIB_PREFIX" -compact
.It Ev RUBYLIB
A colon-separated list of directories that are added to Ruby's
library load path
.Pf ( Li "$:" ) . Directories from this environment variable are searched
before the standard load path is searched.
.Pp
e.g.:
.Dl RUBYLIB="$HOME/lib/ruby:$HOME/lib/rubyext"
.Pp
.It Ev RUBYOPT
Additional Ruby options.
.Pp
e.g.
.Dl RUBYOPT="-w -Ke"
.Pp
Note that RUBYOPT can contain only
.Fl d , Fl E , Fl I , Fl K , Fl r , Fl T , Fl U , Fl v , Fl w , Fl W, Fl -debug ,
.Fl -disable- Ns Ar FEATURE
and
.Fl -enable- Ns Ar FEATURE .
.Pp
.It Ev RUBYPATH
A colon-separated list of directories that Ruby searches for
Ruby programs when the
.Fl S
flag is specified.  This variable precedes the
.Ev PATH
environment variable.
.Pp
.It Ev RUBYSHELL
The path to the system shell command.  This environment variable is
enabled for only mswin32, mingw32, and OS/2 platforms.  If this
variable is not defined, Ruby refers to
.Ev COMSPEC .
.Pp
.It Ev PATH
Ruby refers to the
.Ev PATH
environment variable on calling Kernel#system.
.Pp
.It Ev RUBYLIB_PREFIX
This variable is obsolete.
.El
.Pp
And Ruby depends on some RubyGems related environment variables unless RubyGems is disabled.

.SH NAME
runocc.d \- run queue occupancy by CPU. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B runocc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints the dispatcher run queue occupancy by CPU each second.
A consistant run queue occupancy is a sign of CPU saturation.

The value is similar to that seen in "sar -q", however this is
calculated in a more accurate manner - sampling at 1000 Hertz.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Print %runocc by CPU every second,
# 
.B runocc.d
.PP
.SH FIELDS
.TP
CPU
cpu ID
.TP
%runocc
percent run queue occupancy, sampled at 1000 Hertz
.PP

.PP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the 
Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
.SH EXIT
runocc.d will sample until Ctrl\-C is hit.

.Nd show host status of local machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl alrtu
.Op Ar host ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility gives a status line like
.Xr uptime 1
for each machine on the local network; these are formed from packets
broadcast by each host on the network once every three minutes.
.Pp
If no operands are given,
.Nm
displays uptime status for all machines;
otherwise only those hosts specified on the command line are displayed.
If hosts are specified on the command line, the sort order is equivalent
to the order hosts were specified on the command line.
.Pp
Machines for which no status report has been received for 11
minutes are shown as being down, and machines for which no status
report has been received for 4 days are not shown in the list at all.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Include all users.
By default, if a user has not typed to the system for
an hour or more, then the user will be omitted from the output.
.It Fl l
Sort by load average.
.It Fl r
Reverse the sort order.
.It Fl t
Sort by uptime.
.It Fl u
Sort by number of users.
.El
.Pp
The default listing is sorted by host name.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vim
is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.
It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.
It is especially useful for editing programs.
.PP
There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo,
multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..
See ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between
.B Vim
and Vi.
.PP
While running
.B Vim
a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the ":help"
command.
See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
.PP
Most often
.B Vim
is started to edit a single file with the command
.PP
	vim file
.PP
More generally
.B Vim
is started with:
.PP
	vim [options] [filelist]
.PP
If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.
.TP 12
file ..
A list of filenames.
The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
You can get to the other files with the ":next" command.
To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "\-\-".
.TP
\-
The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which
should be a tty.
.TP
\-t {tag}
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a "tag", a sort
of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
name.
The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file
and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function.
See ":help tag\-commands".
.TP
\-q [errorfile]
Start in quickFix mode.
The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
option (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors.err" on other
systems).
Further errors can be jumped to with the ":cn" command.
See ":help quickfix".
.PP
.B Vim
behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).
.TP 10
vim
The "normal" way, everything is default.
.TP
ex
Start in Ex mode.
Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
Can also be done with the "\-e" argument.
.TP
view
Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can
also be done with the "\-R" argument.
.TP
gvim gview
The GUI version.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-g" argument.
.TP
evim eview
The GUI version in easy mode.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-y" argument.
.TP
rvim rview rgvim rgview
Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell
commands, or suspend
.B Vim.
Can also be done with the "\-Z" argument.
.SH OPTIONS
The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
.TP 12
+[num]
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line "num".
If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last line.
.TP
+/{pat}
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
first occurrence of {pat}.
See ":help search\-pattern" for the available search patterns.
.TP
+{command}
.TP
\-c {command}
{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read.
{command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes (this
depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim "+set si" main.c
.br
Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-S {file}
{file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.
This is equivalent to \-c "source {file}".
{file} cannot start with '\-'.
If {file} is omitted "Session.vim" is used (only works when \-S is the last
argument).
.TP
\-\-cmd {command}
Like using "\-c", but the command is executed just before
processing any vimrc file.
You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-A
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Arabic mode, i.e. 'arabic' is set.  Otherwise an error
message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-b
Binary mode.
A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.
.TP
\-C
Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.
.TP
\-d
Start in diff mode.
There should be two, three or four file name arguments.
.B Vim
will open all the files and show differences between them.
Works like vimdiff(1).
.TP
\-d {device}
Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga.
Example:
"\-d con:20/30/600/150".
.TP
\-D
Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a
script.
.TP
\-e
Start
.B Vim
in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".
.TP
\-E
Start
.B Vim
in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".
.TP
\-f
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
On the Amiga,
.B Vim
is not restarted to open a new window.
This option should be used when
.B Vim
is executed by a program that will wait for the edit
session to finish (e.g. mail).
On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.
.TP
\-\-nofork
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
.TP
\-F
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-g
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.
If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-h
Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.
After this
.B Vim
exits.
.TP
\-H
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-i {viminfo}
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use,
instead of the default "~/.viminfo".
This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
"NONE".
.TP
\-L
Same as \-r.
.TP
\-l
Lisp mode.
Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.
.TP
\-m
Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the 'write' option.
You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.
.TP
\-M
Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be unset,
so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these
options can be set to enable making modifications.
.TP
\-N
No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does
not exist.
.TP
\-n
No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).
Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
Can be undone with ":set uc=200".
.TP
\-nb
Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.
.TP
\-o[N]
Open N windows stacked.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-O[N]
Open N windows side by side.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-p[N]
Open N tab pages.
When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.
.TP
\-R
Read-only mode.
The 'readonly' option will be set.
You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in ":w!".
The \-R option also implies the \-n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".
See ":help 'readonly'".
.TP
\-r
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
.TP
\-r {file}
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp"
appended.
See ":help recovery".
.TP
\-s
Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "\-e" option was given
before the "\-s" option.
.TP
\-s {scriptin}
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
.TP
\-T {terminal}
Tells
.B Vim
the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
.B Vim
(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
.TP
\-u {vimrc}
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help initialization" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-U {gvimrc}
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help gui\-init" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-V[N]
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
Default is 10.
.TP
\-v
Start
.B Vim
in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only has effect
when the executable is called "ex".
.TP
\-w {scriptout}
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
.B Vim.
This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim \-s" or
":source!".
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
.TP
\-W {scriptout}
Like \-w, but an existing file is overwritten.
.TP
\-x
Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.
.TP
\-X
Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the
window title and clipboard will not be used.
.TP
\-y
Start
.B Vim
in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
Makes
.B Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.
.TP
\-Z
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".
.TP
\-\-
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '\-'.
.TP
\-\-echo\-wid
GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.
.TP
\-\-help
Give a help message and exit, just like "\-h".
.TP
\-\-literal
Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.
.TP
\-\-noplugin
Skip loading plugins.  Implied by \-u NONE.
.TP
\-\-remote
Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments.  If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
in the current Vim.
.TP
\-\-remote\-expr {expr}
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.
.TP
\-\-remote\-send {keys}
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.
.TP
\-\-remote\-silent
As \-\-remote, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait
As \-\-remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait\-silent
As \-\-remote\-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-serverlist
List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.
.TP
\-\-servername {name}
Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a
\-\-remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.
.TP
\-\-socketid {id}
GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.
.TP
\-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
Type ":help" in
.B Vim
to get started.
Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject.
For example: ":help ZZ" to get help for the "ZZ" command.
Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help cmdline\-completion").
Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort of hypertext links,
see ":help").
All documentation files can be viewed in this way, for example
":help syntax.txt".

Probably.
See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.
.PP
Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vim
is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.
It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.
It is especially useful for editing programs.
.PP
There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo,
multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..
See ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between
.B Vim
and Vi.
.PP
While running
.B Vim
a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the ":help"
command.
See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
.PP
Most often
.B Vim
is started to edit a single file with the command
.PP
	vim file
.PP
More generally
.B Vim
is started with:
.PP
	vim [options] [filelist]
.PP
If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.
.TP 12
file ..
A list of filenames.
The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
You can get to the other files with the ":next" command.
To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "\-\-".
.TP
\-
The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which
should be a tty.
.TP
\-t {tag}
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a "tag", a sort
of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
name.
The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file
and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function.
See ":help tag\-commands".
.TP
\-q [errorfile]
Start in quickFix mode.
The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
option (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors.err" on other
systems).
Further errors can be jumped to with the ":cn" command.
See ":help quickfix".
.PP
.B Vim
behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).
.TP 10
vim
The "normal" way, everything is default.
.TP
ex
Start in Ex mode.
Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
Can also be done with the "\-e" argument.
.TP
view
Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can
also be done with the "\-R" argument.
.TP
gvim gview
The GUI version.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-g" argument.
.TP
evim eview
The GUI version in easy mode.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the "\-y" argument.
.TP
rvim rview rgvim rgview
Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell
commands, or suspend
.B Vim.
Can also be done with the "\-Z" argument.
.SH OPTIONS
The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
.TP 12
+[num]
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line "num".
If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last line.
.TP
+/{pat}
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
first occurrence of {pat}.
See ":help search\-pattern" for the available search patterns.
.TP
+{command}
.TP
\-c {command}
{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read.
{command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes (this
depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim "+set si" main.c
.br
Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-S {file}
{file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.
This is equivalent to \-c "source {file}".
{file} cannot start with '\-'.
If {file} is omitted "Session.vim" is used (only works when \-S is the last
argument).
.TP
\-\-cmd {command}
Like using "\-c", but the command is executed just before
processing any vimrc file.
You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "\-c" commands.
.TP
\-A
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Arabic mode, i.e. 'arabic' is set.  Otherwise an error
message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-b
Binary mode.
A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.
.TP
\-C
Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.
.TP
\-d
Start in diff mode.
There should be two, three or four file name arguments.
.B Vim
will open all the files and show differences between them.
Works like vimdiff(1).
.TP
\-d {device}
Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga.
Example:
"\-d con:20/30/600/150".
.TP
\-D
Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a
script.
.TP
\-e
Start
.B Vim
in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".
.TP
\-E
Start
.B Vim
in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".
.TP
\-f
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
On the Amiga,
.B Vim
is not restarted to open a new window.
This option should be used when
.B Vim
is executed by a program that will wait for the edit
session to finish (e.g. mail).
On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.
.TP
\-\-nofork
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
.B Vim
will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
.TP
\-F
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-g
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.
If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-h
Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.
After this
.B Vim
exits.
.TP
\-H
If
.B Vim
has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts
.B Vim
in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
.B Vim
aborts.
.TP
\-i {viminfo}
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use,
instead of the default "~/.viminfo".
This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
"NONE".
.TP
\-L
Same as \-r.
.TP
\-l
Lisp mode.
Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.
.TP
\-m
Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the 'write' option.
You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.
.TP
\-M
Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be unset,
so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these
options can be set to enable making modifications.
.TP
\-N
No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.
This will make
.B Vim
behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does
not exist.
.TP
\-n
No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).
Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
Can be undone with ":set uc=200".
.TP
\-nb
Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.
.TP
\-o[N]
Open N windows stacked.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-O[N]
Open N windows side by side.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
.TP
\-p[N]
Open N tab pages.
When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.
.TP
\-R
Read-only mode.
The 'readonly' option will be set.
You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in ":w!".
The \-R option also implies the \-n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".
See ":help 'readonly'".
.TP
\-r
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
.TP
\-r {file}
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp"
appended.
See ":help recovery".
.TP
\-s
Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "\-e" option was given
before the "\-s" option.
.TP
\-s {scriptin}
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
.TP
\-T {terminal}
Tells
.B Vim
the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
.B Vim
(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
.TP
\-u {vimrc}
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help initialization" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-U {gvimrc}
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name "NONE".
See ":help gui\-init" within vim for more details.
.TP
\-V[N]
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
Default is 10.
.TP
\-v
Start
.B Vim
in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only has effect
when the executable is called "ex".
.TP
\-w {scriptout}
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
.B Vim.
This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim \-s" or
":source!".
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
.TP
\-W {scriptout}
Like \-w, but an existing file is overwritten.
.TP
\-x
Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.
.TP
\-X
Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the
window title and clipboard will not be used.
.TP
\-y
Start
.B Vim
in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
Makes
.B Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.
.TP
\-Z
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".
.TP
\-\-
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '\-'.
.TP
\-\-echo\-wid
GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.
.TP
\-\-help
Give a help message and exit, just like "\-h".
.TP
\-\-literal
Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.
.TP
\-\-noplugin
Skip loading plugins.  Implied by \-u NONE.
.TP
\-\-remote
Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments.  If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
in the current Vim.
.TP
\-\-remote\-expr {expr}
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.
.TP
\-\-remote\-send {keys}
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.
.TP
\-\-remote\-silent
As \-\-remote, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait
As \-\-remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.
.TP
\-\-remote\-wait\-silent
As \-\-remote\-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.
.TP
\-\-serverlist
List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.
.TP
\-\-servername {name}
Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a
\-\-remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.
.TP
\-\-socketid {id}
GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.
.TP
\-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
Type ":help" in
.B Vim
to get started.
Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject.
For example: ":help ZZ" to get help for the "ZZ" command.
Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help cmdline\-completion").
Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort of hypertext links,
see ":help").
All documentation files can be viewed in this way, for example
":help syntax.txt".

.B Vim
is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson,
Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter.
Although hardly any of the original code remains.
.SH BUGS
Probably.
See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.
.PP
Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim).
Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.

rwbytype.d \- read/write bytes by vnode type. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rwbytype.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program identifies the vnode type of read/write activity - whether
that is for regular files, sockets, character special devices, etc. This
is measuring at the application level, so file activity may well be 
cached by the system.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command produces output similar to
.Xr who 1 ,
but for all machines on the local network.
If no report has been
received from a machine for 11 minutes then
.Nm
assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known
to be logged into that machine.
.Pp
If a user has not typed to the system for a minute or more, then
.Nm
reports this idle time.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Include all users.
By default, if a user has not typed to the system for
an hour or more, then the user will be omitted from the output.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION\*(R"\s0.
.PP
\&\fBsed\fR returns an exit code of 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
A file specified as argument to the \fBw\fR edit command is by default
opened before input processing starts. Using \fB\-a\fR, opening of such
files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIscript-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f script-file"
Editing commands from the specified \fIscript-file\fR are read and appended
to the script.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "number"
The line with the given number is selected.
.IP "\fB$\fR" 4
.IX Item "$"
A dollar sign (\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR) is the line number of the last line of the input stream.
.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with each
function synopsis below.
.PP
The argument \fItext\fR consists of one or more lines following the command.
Embedded newlines in \fItext\fR must be preceded with a backslash.  Other
backslashes in \fItext\fR are deleted and the following character is taken
literally.
.IP "[1addr]\fBa\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]a text"
Write \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output immediately before reading the next line
of input, either by executing the \fBN\fR function or by beginning a new cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBb\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]b [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR. If no label
is given, branch to the end of the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBc\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]c text"
The line, or range of lines, selected by the address is deleted. 
The \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
is written to standard output. With an address range, this occurs at
the end of the range.
.IP "[2addr]\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]d"
Deletes the pattern space and starts the next cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBD\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]D"
Deletes the pattern space through the first embedded newline or to the end.
If the pattern space becomes empty, a new cycle is started, otherwise
execution of the script is restarted.
.IP "[2addr]\fBg\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]g"
Replace the contents of the pattern space with the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBG\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]G"
Append a newline and the contents of the hold space to the pattern space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]h"
Replace the contents of the hold space with the pattern space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBH\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]H"
Append a newline and the contents of the pattern space to the hold space.
.IP "[1addr]\fBi\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]i text"
Write the \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output.
.IP "[2addr]\fBl\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]l"
Print the contents of the pattern space: non-printable characters are
shown in C\-style escaped form; long lines are split and have a trailing
^'\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' at the point of the split; the true end of a line is marked with
a '\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR'. Escapes are: '\ea', '\et', '\en', '\ef', '\er', '\ee' for
\&\s-1BEL, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC,\s0 respectively, and '\e' followed by a three-digit
octal number for all other non-printable characters.
.IP "[2addr]\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]n"
If automatic printing is enabled, write the pattern space to the standard
output. Replace the pattern space with the next line of input. If
there is no more input, processing is terminated.

Substitute the \fIreplacement\fR string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the \fIregular expression\fR.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a 
slash to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.
To use the delimiter as a literal character within the regular expression
and the replacement, precede the character by a backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.Sp
Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by
preceding a newline with a backslash.
.Sp
Within the replacement, an ampersand ('\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR') is replaced by the string
matching the regular expression. The strings '\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR' through '\f(CW\*(C`\e9\*(C'\fR' are
replaced by the corresponding subpattern (see \*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0).
To get a literal '\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' in the replacement text, precede it
by a backslash.

.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2,\s0 consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE.\s0
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)
.PP
A character class is one of the class names
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   alnum     digit     punct

.Ve
.PP
enclosed in \fB[:\fR and \fB:]\fR and represents the set of characters
as defined in \fIctype\fR\|(3).
.PP
If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.
.PP
To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR', place it anywhere else but first. To
include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR' place it first or immediately after an
initial \fB^\fR. To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' make it the first (or
second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.
.PP
The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)
.SS "Additional Atoms"

atoms (not defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2\s0), \fBpsed\fR is capable of translating

regular expression\*(R". Since keeping track of pattern usage would create
terribly cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
context (where other \fBsed\fR implementations appear to deviate, too),
the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature,

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED\s0 \s-1SCRIPT\s0 \s-1TRANSLATION\s0\*(R".
.PP
\&\fBsed\fR returns an exit code of 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
A file specified as argument to the \fBw\fR edit command is by default
opened before input processing starts. Using \fB\-a\fR, opening of such
files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIscript-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f script-file"
Editing commands from the specified \fIscript-file\fR are read and appended
to the script.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "number"
The line with the given number is selected.
.IP "\fB$\fR" 4
.IX Item "$"
A dollar sign (\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR) is the line number of the last line of the input stream.
.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC\s0 \s-1REGULAR\s0 \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0\*(R"), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with each
function synopsis below.
.PP
The argument \fItext\fR consists of one or more lines following the command.
Embedded newlines in \fItext\fR must be preceded with a backslash.  Other
backslashes in \fItext\fR are deleted and the following character is taken
literally.
.IP "[1addr]\fBa\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]a text"
Write \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)

Print the contents of the pattern space: non-printable characters are
shown in C\-style escaped form; long lines are split and have a trailing
^'\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' at the point of the split; the true end of a line is marked with
a '\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR'. Escapes are: '\ea', '\et', '\en', '\ef', '\er', '\ee' for
\&\s-1BEL\s0, \s-1HT\s0, \s-1LF\s0, \s-1FF\s0, \s-1CR\s0, \s-1ESC\s0, respectively, and '\e' followed by a three-digit
octal number for all other non-printable characters.
.IP "[2addr]\fBn\fR" 4

the next attempt to read a line of input. Any error encountered while
reading \fIfile\fR is silently ignored.
.IP "[2addr]\fBs/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags"
Substitute the \fIreplacement\fR string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the \fIregular expression\fR.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a 
slash to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.
To use the delimiter as a literal character within the regular expression
and the replacement, precede the character by a backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.Sp
Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by
preceding a newline with a backslash.
.Sp
Within the replacement, an ampersand ('\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR') is replaced by the string
matching the regular expression. The strings '\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR' through '\f(CW\*(C`\e9\*(C'\fR' are
replaced by the corresponding subpattern (see \*(L"\s-1BASIC\s0 \s-1REGULAR\s0 \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0\*(R").
To get a literal '\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' in the replacement text, precede it
by a backslash.

or execution of a \fBt\fR function. If no label is given, branch to the end of
the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBw\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]w file"
The contents of the pattern space are written to the \fIfile\fR.
.IP "[2addr]\fBx\fR" 4

Swap the contents of the pattern space and the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBy\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring1\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring2\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]y/string1/string2/"
In the pattern space, replace all characters occurring in \fIstring1\fR by the
character at the corresponding position in \fIstring2\fR. It is possible
to use any character (other than a backslash or newline) instead of a
slash to delimit the strings.  Within \fIstring1\fR and \fIstring2\fR, a
backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that literal
character, and a backslash followed by an 'n' is replaced by a newline
character.
.IP "[1addr]\fB=\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]="
Prints the current line number on the standard output.
.IP "[0addr]\fB:\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]: [label]"
The command specifies the position of the \fIlabel\fR. It has no other effect.

These two commands begin and end a command list. The first command may
be given on the same line as the opening \fB{\fR command. The commands
within the list are jointly selected by the address(es) given on the
\&\fB{\fR command (but may still have individual addresses).
.IP "[0addr]\fB#\fR [\fIcomment\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]# [comment]"
The entire line is ignored (treated as a comment). If, however, the first
two characters in the script are '\f(CW\*(C`#n\*(C'\fR', automatic printing of output is
suppressed, as if the \fB\-n\fR option were given on the command line.
.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX\s0 1003.2, consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE\s0.
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)
.PP
A character class is one of the class names

.PP
enclosed in \fB[:\fR and \fB:]\fR and represents the set of characters
as defined in \fIctype\fR\|(3).
.PP
If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.
.PP
To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR', place it anywhere else but first. To
include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR' place it first or immediately after an
initial \fB^\fR. To include a literal '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' make it the first (or
second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.
.PP
The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)

the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature,
such as in \f(CW\*(C`/abc/s//xyz/\*(C'\fR, will work as expected.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified files
(or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines
to standard output. The filename '\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR' may be used to read standard input.
.PP
The edit script is composed from arguments of \fB\-e\fR options and
script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be specified
as the first parameter.
.PP
If this program is invoked with the name \fIs2p\fR, it will act as a
sed-to-Perl translator. See \*(L"\s-1SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION\*(R"\s0.
.PP
\&\fBsed\fR returns an exit code of 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
A file specified as argument to the \fBw\fR edit command is by default
opened before input processing starts. Using \fB\-a\fR, opening of such
files is delayed until the first line is actually written to the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e script"
The editing commands defined by \fIscript\fR are appended to the script.
Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIscript-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f script-file"
Editing commands from the specified \fIscript-file\fR are read and appended
to the script.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, a line is written to standard output after the editing script
has been applied to it. The \fB\-n\fR option suppresses automatic printing.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
\&\fBsed\fR command syntax is defined as
.PP
   [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]][\fB!\fR]\fIfunction\fR[\fIargument\fR]
.PP
with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and between
the function character and the argument. The \fIaddress\fRes and the
address inverter (\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.
.PP
Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
the synopses below.
.PP
The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the line
(without its trailing newline character) into the \fIpattern space\fR,
applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output.
A \fIhold space\fR is provided for saving the contents of the
pattern space for later use.
.SS "Addresses"
.IX Subsection "Addresses"
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be combined
arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.
.PP
Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark ('\f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR'), selecting
all lines not matching that address.
.IP "\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "number"
The line with the given number is selected.
.IP "\fB$\fR" 4
.IX Item "$"
A dollar sign (\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR) is the line number of the last line of the input stream.
.IP "\fB/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/regular expression/"
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0), between the delimiting character \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Any other character except \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or newline may be used to delimit a
pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a
backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.PP
If no address is given, the command selects every line.
.PP
If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching the
address.
.PP
Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first address
matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address matches.
If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second 
address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of
the range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the
first address is not applied to the very same line to determine the
begin of another range. If both addresses are line numbers,
and the second line number is less than the first line number, then
only the first line is selected.
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with each
function synopsis below.
.PP
The argument \fItext\fR consists of one or more lines following the command.
Embedded newlines in \fItext\fR must be preceded with a backslash.  Other
backslashes in \fItext\fR are deleted and the following character is taken
literally.
.IP "[1addr]\fBa\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]a text"
Write \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output immediately before reading the next line
of input, either by executing the \fBN\fR function or by beginning a new cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBb\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]b [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR. If no label
is given, branch to the end of the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBc\e\fR \fItext\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]c text"
The line, or range of lines, selected by the address is deleted. 
The \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
is written to standard output. With an address range, this occurs at
the end of the range.
.IP "[2addr]\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]d"
Deletes the pattern space and starts the next cycle.
.IP "[2addr]\fBD\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]D"
Deletes the pattern space through the first embedded newline or to the end.
If the pattern space becomes empty, a new cycle is started, otherwise
execution of the script is restarted.
.IP "[2addr]\fBg\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]g"
Replace the contents of the pattern space with the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBG\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]G"

Write the \fItext\fR (which must start on the line following the command)
to standard output.
.IP "[2addr]\fBl\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]l"
Print the contents of the pattern space: non-printable characters are
shown in C\-style escaped form; long lines are split and have a trailing
^'\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' at the point of the split; the true end of a line is marked with
a '\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR'. Escapes are: '\ea', '\et', '\en', '\ef', '\er', '\ee' for
\&\s-1BEL, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC,\s0 respectively, and '\e' followed by a three-digit
octal number for all other non-printable characters.
.IP "[2addr]\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]n"
If automatic printing is enabled, write the pattern space to the standard
output. Replace the pattern space with the next line of input. If
there is no more input, processing is terminated.
.IP "[2addr]\fBN\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]N"
Append a newline and the next line of input to the pattern space. If
there is no more input, processing is terminated.
.IP "[2addr]\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]p"
Print the pattern space to the standard output. (Use the \fB\-n\fR option
to suppress automatic printing at the end of a cycle if you want to
avoid double printing of lines.)
.IP "[2addr]\fBP\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]P"
Prints the pattern space through the first embedded newline or to the end.
.IP "[1addr]\fBq\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]q"
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new cycle.
.IP "[1addr]\fBr\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]r file"
Copy the contents of the \fIfile\fR to standard output immediately before
the next attempt to read a line of input. Any error encountered while
reading \fIfile\fR is silently ignored.
.IP "[2addr]\fBs/\fR\fIregular expression\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags"
Substitute the \fIreplacement\fR string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the \fIregular expression\fR.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a 
slash to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.
To use the delimiter as a literal character within the regular expression
and the replacement, precede the character by a backslash ('\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR').
.Sp
Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by
preceding a newline with a backslash.
.Sp
Within the replacement, an ampersand ('\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR') is replaced by the string
matching the regular expression. The strings '\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR' through '\f(CW\*(C`\e9\*(C'\fR' are
replaced by the corresponding subpattern (see \*(L"\s-1BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\*(R"\s0).
To get a literal '\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR' in the replacement text, precede it
by a backslash.
.Sp
The following \fIflags\fR modify the behaviour of the \fBs\fR command:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBg\fR" 8
.IX Item "g"
The replacement is performed for all matching, non-overlapping substrings
of the pattern space.

Replace only the n\-th matching substring of the pattern space.
.IP "\fBp\fR" 8
.IX Item "p"
If the substitution was made, print the new value of the pattern space.
.IP "\fBw\fR \fIfile\fR" 8

If the substitution was made, write the new value of the pattern space
to the specified file.
.RE
.RS 4

.IP "[2addr]\fBt\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]t [label]"
Branch to the \fB:\fR function with the specified \fIlabel\fR if any \fBs\fR
substitutions have been made since the most recent reading of an input line
or execution of a \fBt\fR function. If no label is given, branch to the end of
the script.
.IP "[2addr]\fBw\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]w file"
The contents of the pattern space are written to the \fIfile\fR.
.IP "[2addr]\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]x"
Swap the contents of the pattern space and the hold space.
.IP "[2addr]\fBy\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring1\fR\fB/\fR\fIstring2\fR\fB/\fR" 4
.IX Item "[2addr]y/string1/string2/"
In the pattern space, replace all characters occurring in \fIstring1\fR by the
character at the corresponding position in \fIstring2\fR. It is possible
to use any character (other than a backslash or newline) instead of a
slash to delimit the strings.  Within \fIstring1\fR and \fIstring2\fR, a
backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that literal
character, and a backslash followed by an 'n' is replaced by a newline
character.
.IP "[1addr]\fB=\fR" 4
.IX Item "[1addr]="
Prints the current line number on the standard output.
.IP "[0addr]\fB:\fR [\fIlabel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]: [label]"
The command specifies the position of the \fIlabel\fR. It has no other effect.

.IX Item "[2addr]{ [command]"
.PD 0
.IP "[0addr]\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]}"
.PD
These two commands begin and end a command list. The first command may
be given on the same line as the opening \fB{\fR command. The commands
within the list are jointly selected by the address(es) given on the
\&\fB{\fR command (but may still have individual addresses).
.IP "[0addr]\fB#\fR [\fIcomment\fR]" 4
.IX Item "[0addr]# [comment]"
The entire line is ignored (treated as a comment). If, however, the first
two characters in the script are '\f(CW\*(C`#n\*(C'\fR', automatic printing of output is
suppressed, as if the \fB\-n\fR option were given on the command line.
.SH "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
.IX Header "BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
A \fIBasic Regular Expression\fR (\s-1BRE\s0), as defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2,\s0 consists
of \fIatoms\fR, for matching parts of a string, and \fIbounds\fR, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.
.SS "Atoms"
.IX Subsection "Atoms"
The possible atoms of a \s-1BRE\s0 are: \fB.\fR, matching any single character;
\&\fB^\fR and \fB$\fR, matching the null string at the beginning or end
of a string, respectively; a \fIbracket expressions\fR, enclosed
in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR (see below); and any single character with no
other significance (matching that character). A \fB\e\fR before one
of: \fB.\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB\e\fR, matching the character
after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR
becomes an atom and establishes the target for a \fIbackreference\fR,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
Finally, \fB\e\fR followed by one of the digits \fB0\fR through \fB9\fR is a
backreference.
.PP
A \fB^\fR that is not first, or a \fB$\fR that is not last does not have
a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
become literal. The same is true for a \fB]\fR, that does not terminate
a bracket expression.
.PP
An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a \s-1BRE.\s0
.SS "Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Bounds"
The \s-1BRE\s0 bounds are: \fB*\fR, specifying 0 or more matches of the preceding
atom; \fB\e{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\e}\fR, specifying that many repetitions;
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\e}\fR, giving a lower limit; and
\&\fB\e{\fR\fIminimum\fR\fB,\fR\fImaximum\fR\fB\e}\fR finally defines a lower and upper
bound.
.PP
A bound appearing as the first item in a \s-1BRE\s0 is taken literally.
.SS "Bracket Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Bracket Expressions"
A \fIbracket expression\fR is a list of characters, character ranges
and character classes enclosed in \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR and matches any
single character from the represented set of characters.
.PP
A character range is written as two characters separated by \fB\-\fR and
represents all characters (according to the character collating sequence)
that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
(Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs
should avoid relying on them.)

If the first character after \fB[\fR is \fB^\fR, the sense of matching is
inverted.

second after \fB^\fR) or last character, or the second endpoint of
a range.

The special bracket expression constructs \f(CW\*(C`[[:<:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:>:]]\*(C'\fR 
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note that neither is identical to Perl's '\eb' atom.)

Since some sed implementations provide additional regular expression
atoms (not defined in \s-1POSIX 1003.2\s0), \fBpsed\fR is capable of translating
the following backslash escapes:

.PP
The meaning of an empty regular expression ('\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR'), as defined by \fBsed\fR,
is \*(L"the last pattern used, at run time\*(R". This deviates from the Perl
interpretation, which will re-use the \*(L"last last successfully executed
regular expression\*(R". Since keeping track of pattern usage would create
terribly cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
context (where other \fBsed\fR implementations appear to deviate, too),
the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature,
such as in \f(CW\*(C`/abc/s//xyz/\*(C'\fR, will work as expected.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBs_client\fR command implements a generic \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 client which connects
to a remote host using \s-1SSL/TLS.\s0 It is a \fIvery\fR useful diagnostic tool for
\&\s-1SSL\s0 servers.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
In addition to the options below the \fBs_client\fR utility also supports the
common and client only options documented in the
in the \fISSL_CONF_cmd\fR\|(3)
manual page.
.IP "\fB\-connect host:port\fR" 4
.IX Item "-connect host:port"
This specifies the host and optional port to connect to. If not specified
then an attempt is made to connect to the local host on port 4433.
.IP "\fB\-cert certname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cert certname"
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server. The default is
not to use a certificate.
.IP "\fB\-certform format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-certform format"
The certificate format to use: \s-1DER\s0 or \s-1PEM. PEM\s0 is the default.
.IP "\fB\-key keyfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-key keyfile"
The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file will
be used.
.IP "\fB\-keyform format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyform format"
The private format to use: \s-1DER\s0 or \s-1PEM. PEM\s0 is the default.
.IP "\fB\-pass arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass arg"
the private key password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-verify depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify depth"
The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
server certificate chain and turns on server certificate verification.
Currently the verify operation continues after errors so all the problems
with a certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect the connection
will never fail due to a server certificate verify failure.
.IP "\fB\-CApath directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CApath directory"
The directory to use for server certificate verification. This directory
must be in \*(L"hash format\*(R", see \fBverify\fR for more information. These are
also used when building the client certificate chain.
.IP "\fB\-CAfile file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAfile file"
A file containing trusted certificates to use during server authentication
and to use when attempting to build the client certificate chain.
.IP "\fB\-attime\fR, \fB\-check_ss_sig\fR, \fB\-crl_check\fR, \fB\-crl_check_all\fR, \fBexplicit_policy\fR, \fB\-ignore_critical\fR, \fB\-inhibit_any\fR, \fB\-inhibit_map\fR, \fB\-issuer_checks\fR, \fB\-policy\fR, \fB\-policy_check\fR, \fB\-policy_print\fR, \fB\-purpose\fR, \fB\-use_deltas\fR, \fB\-verify_depth\fR, \fB\-x509_strict\fR" 4

Set various certificate chain valiadition options. See the
\&\fBverify\fR manual page for details.
.IP "\fB\-reconnect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-reconnect"
reconnects to the same server 5 times using the same session \s-1ID,\s0 this can
be used as a test that session caching is working.
.IP "\fB\-pause\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pause"
pauses 1 second between each read and write call.
.IP "\fB\-showcerts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-showcerts"
display the whole server certificate chain: normally only the server
certificate itself is displayed.
.IP "\fB\-prexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-prexit"
print session information when the program exits. This will always attempt
to print out information even if the connection fails. Normally information
will only be printed out once if the connection succeeds. This option is useful
because the cipher in use may be renegotiated or the connection may fail
because a client certificate is required or is requested only after an
attempt is made to access a certain \s-1URL.\s0 Note: the output produced by this
option is not always accurate because a connection might never have been
established.
.IP "\fB\-state\fR" 4
.IX Item "-state"
prints out the \s-1SSL\s0 session states.
.IP "\fB\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-debug"
print extensive debugging information including a hex dump of all traffic.
.IP "\fB\-msg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msg"
show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.IP "\fB\-nbio_test\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nbio_test"
tests non-blocking I/O
.IP "\fB\-nbio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nbio"
turns on non-blocking I/O
.IP "\fB\-crlf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-crlf"
this option translated a line feed from the terminal into \s-1CR+LF\s0 as required
by some servers.
.IP "\fB\-ign_eof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ign_eof"
inhibit shutting down the connection when end of file is reached in the
input.
.IP "\fB\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-quiet"
inhibit printing of session and certificate information.  This implicitly
turns on \fB\-ign_eof\fR as well.
.IP "\fB\-ssl2\fR, \fB\-ssl3\fR, \fB\-tls1\fR, \fB\-no_ssl2\fR, \fB\-no_ssl3\fR, \fB\-no_tls1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ssl2, -ssl3, -tls1, -no_ssl2, -no_ssl3, -no_tls1"
these options disable the use of certain \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1TLS\s0 protocols. By default
the initial handshake uses a method which should be compatible with all
servers and permit them to use \s-1SSL\s0 v3, \s-1SSL\s0 v2 or \s-1TLS\s0 as appropriate.
.Sp
Unfortunately there are still ancient and broken servers in use which
cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect. Some servers only
work if \s-1TLS\s0 is turned off.
.IP "\fB\-fallback_scsv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fallback_scsv"
Send \s-1TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV\s0 in the ClientHello.
.IP "\fB\-bugs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-bugs"
there are several known bug in \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1TLS\s0 implementations. Adding this
option enables various workarounds.
.IP "\fB\-cipher cipherlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cipher cipherlist"
this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be modified. Although
the server determines which cipher suite is used it should take the first
supported cipher in the list sent by the client. See the \fBciphers\fR
command for more information.
.IP "\fB\-starttls protocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-starttls protocol"
send the protocol-specific message(s) to switch to \s-1TLS\s0 for communication.
\&\fBprotocol\fR is a keyword for the intended protocol.  Currently, the only
supported keywords are \*(L"smtp\*(R", \*(L"pop3\*(R", \*(L"imap\*(R", \*(L"ftp\*(R" and \*(L"xmpp\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-xmpphost hostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-xmpphost hostname"
This option, when used with \*(L"\-starttls xmpp\*(R", specifies the host for the
\&\*(L"to\*(R" attribute of the stream element.
If this option is not specified, then the host specified with \*(L"\-connect\*(R"
will be used.
.IP "\fB\-tlsextdebug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tlsextdebug"
print out a hex dump of any \s-1TLS\s0 extensions received from the server.
.IP "\fB\-no_ticket\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_ticket"
disable RFC4507bis session ticket support.
.IP "\fB\-sess_out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sess_out filename"
output \s-1SSL\s0 session to \fBfilename\fR
.IP "\fB\-sess_in sess.pem\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sess_in sess.pem"
load \s-1SSL\s0 session from \fBfilename\fR. The client will attempt to resume a
connection from this session.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by its unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBs_client\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.SH "CONNECTED COMMANDS"
.IX Header "CONNECTED COMMANDS"
If a connection is established with an \s-1SSL\s0 server then any data received
from the server is displayed and any key presses will be sent to the
server. When used interactively (which means neither \fB\-quiet\fR nor \fB\-ign_eof\fR
have been given), the session will be renegotiated if the line begins with an
\&\fBR\fR, and if the line begins with a \fBQ\fR or if end of file is reached, the
connection will be closed down.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
\&\fBs_client\fR can be used to debug \s-1SSL\s0 servers. To connect to an \s-1SSL HTTP\s0
server the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl s_client \-connect servername:443
.Ve
.PP
would typically be used (https uses port 443). If the connection succeeds
then an \s-1HTTP\s0 command can be given such as \*(L"\s-1GET /\*(R"\s0 to retrieve a web page.
.PP
If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it is
nothing obvious like no client certificate then the \fB\-bugs\fR, \fB\-ssl2\fR,
\&\fB\-ssl3\fR, \fB\-tls1\fR, \fB\-no_ssl2\fR, \fB\-no_ssl3\fR, \fB\-no_tls1\fR options can be tried
in case it is a buggy server. In particular you should play with these
options \fBbefore\fR submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL mailing list.
.PP
A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending
the clients certificate authority in its \*(L"acceptable \s-1CA\s0 list\*(R" when it
requests a certificate. By using \fBs_client\fR the \s-1CA\s0 list can be viewed
and checked. However some servers only request client authentication
after a specific \s-1URL\s0 is requested. To obtain the list in this case it
is necessary to use the \fB\-prexit\fR option and send an \s-1HTTP\s0 request
for an appropriate page.
.PP
If a certificate is specified on the command line using the \fB\-cert\fR
option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests
a client certificate. Therefor merely including a client certificate
on the command line is no guarantee that the certificate works.
.PP
If there are problems verifying a server certificate then the
\&\fB\-showcerts\fR option can be used to show the whole chain.
.PP
Since the SSLv23 client hello cannot include compression methods or extensions
these will only be supported if its use is disabled, for example by using the
\&\fB\-no_sslv2\fR option.
.PP
The \fBs_client\fR utility is a test tool and is designed to continue the
handshake after any certificate verification errors. As a result it will
accept any certificate chain (trusted or not) sent by the peer. None test
applications should \fBnot\fR do this as it makes them vulnerable to a \s-1MITM\s0
attack.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Because this program has a lot of options and also because some of
the techniques used are rather old, the C source of s_client is rather
hard to read and not a model of how things should be done. A typical
\&\s-1SSL\s0 client program would be much simpler.
.PP
The \fB\-prexit\fR option is a bit of a hack. We should really report
information whenever a session is renegotiated.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBs_server\fR command implements a generic \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 server which listens
for connections on a given port using \s-1SSL/TLS.\s0
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-accept port\fR" 4
.IX Item "-accept port"
the \s-1TCP\s0 port to listen on for connections. If not specified 4433 is used.
.IP "\fB\-context id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-context id"
sets the \s-1SSL\s0 context id. It can be given any string value. If this option
is not present a default value will be used.
.IP "\fB\-cert certname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cert certname"
The certificate to use, most servers cipher suites require the use of a
certificate and some require a certificate with a certain public key type:
for example the \s-1DSS\s0 cipher suites require a certificate containing a \s-1DSS
\&\s0(\s-1DSA\s0) key. If not specified then the filename \*(L"server.pem\*(R" will be used.
.IP "\fB\-certform format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-certform format"
The certificate format to use: \s-1DER\s0 or \s-1PEM. PEM\s0 is the default.
.IP "\fB\-key keyfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-key keyfile"
The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file will
be used.
.IP "\fB\-keyform format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-keyform format"
The private format to use: \s-1DER\s0 or \s-1PEM. PEM\s0 is the default.
.IP "\fB\-pass arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass arg"
the private key password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-dcert filename\fR, \fB\-dkey keyname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dcert filename, -dkey keyname"
specify an additional certificate and private key, these behave in the
same manner as the \fB\-cert\fR and \fB\-key\fR options except there is no default
if they are not specified (no additional certificate and key is used). As
noted above some cipher suites require a certificate containing a key of
a certain type. Some cipher suites need a certificate carrying an \s-1RSA\s0 key
and some a \s-1DSS \s0(\s-1DSA\s0) key. By using \s-1RSA\s0 and \s-1DSS\s0 certificates and keys
a server can support clients which only support \s-1RSA\s0 or \s-1DSS\s0 cipher suites
by using an appropriate certificate.
.IP "\fB\-dcertform format\fR, \fB\-dkeyform format\fR, \fB\-dpass arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dcertform format, -dkeyform format, -dpass arg"
addtional certificate and private key format and passphrase respectively.
.IP "\fB\-nocert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nocert"
if this option is set then no certificate is used. This restricts the
cipher suites available to the anonymous ones (currently just anonymous
\&\s-1DH\s0).
.IP "\fB\-dhparam filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dhparam filename"
the \s-1DH\s0 parameter file to use. The ephemeral \s-1DH\s0 cipher suites generate keys
using a set of \s-1DH\s0 parameters. If not specified then an attempt is made to
load the parameters from the server certificate file. If this fails then
a static set of parameters hard coded into the s_server program will be used.
.IP "\fB\-no_dhe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_dhe"
if this option is set then no \s-1DH\s0 parameters will be loaded effectively
disabling the ephemeral \s-1DH\s0 cipher suites.
.IP "\fB\-no_tmp_rsa\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_tmp_rsa"
certain export cipher suites sometimes use a temporary \s-1RSA\s0 key, this option
disables temporary \s-1RSA\s0 key generation.
.IP "\fB\-verify depth\fR, \fB\-Verify depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify depth, -Verify depth"
The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
client certificate chain and makes the server request a certificate from
the client. With the \fB\-verify\fR option a certificate is requested but the
client does not have to send one, with the \fB\-Verify\fR option the client
must supply a certificate or an error occurs.
.Sp
If the ciphersuite cannot request a client certificate (for example an
anonymous ciphersuite or \s-1PSK\s0) this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-crl_check\fR, \fB\-crl_check_all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-crl_check, -crl_check_all"
Check the peer certificate has not been revoked by its \s-1CA.\s0
The \s-1CRL\s0(s) are appended to the certificate file. With the \fB\-crl_check_all\fR
option all CRLs of all CAs in the chain are checked.
.IP "\fB\-CApath directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CApath directory"
The directory to use for client certificate verification. This directory
must be in \*(L"hash format\*(R", see \fBverify\fR for more information. These are
also used when building the server certificate chain.
.IP "\fB\-CAfile file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAfile file"
A file containing trusted certificates to use during client authentication
and to use when attempting to build the server certificate chain. The list
is also used in the list of acceptable client CAs passed to the client when
a certificate is requested.
.IP "\fB\-state\fR" 4
.IX Item "-state"
prints out the \s-1SSL\s0 session states.
.IP "\fB\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-debug"
print extensive debugging information including a hex dump of all traffic.
.IP "\fB\-msg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msg"
show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.IP "\fB\-nbio_test\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nbio_test"
tests non blocking I/O
.IP "\fB\-nbio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nbio"
turns on non blocking I/O
.IP "\fB\-crlf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-crlf"
this option translated a line feed from the terminal into \s-1CR+LF.\s0
.IP "\fB\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-quiet"
inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
.IP "\fB\-ssl2\fR, \fB\-ssl3\fR, \fB\-tls1\fR, \fB\-no_ssl2\fR, \fB\-no_ssl3\fR, \fB\-no_tls1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ssl2, -ssl3, -tls1, -no_ssl2, -no_ssl3, -no_tls1"
these options disable the use of certain \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1TLS\s0 protocols. By default
the initial handshake uses a method which should be compatible with all
servers and permit them to use \s-1SSL\s0 v3, \s-1SSL\s0 v2 or \s-1TLS\s0 as appropriate.
.IP "\fB\-bugs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-bugs"
there are several known bug in \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1TLS\s0 implementations. Adding this
option enables various workarounds.
.IP "\fB\-hack\fR" 4
.IX Item "-hack"
this option enables a further workaround for some some early Netscape
\&\s-1SSL\s0 code (?).
.IP "\fB\-cipher cipherlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cipher cipherlist"
this allows the cipher list used by the server to be modified.  When
the client sends a list of supported ciphers the first client cipher
also included in the server list is used. Because the client specifies
the preference order, the order of the server cipherlist irrelevant. See
the \fBciphers\fR command for more information.
.IP "\fB\-serverpref\fR" 4
.IX Item "-serverpref"
use the server's cipher preferences, rather than the client's preferences.
.IP "\fB\-tlsextdebug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tlsextdebug"
print out a hex dump of any \s-1TLS\s0 extensions received from the server.
.IP "\fB\-no_ticket\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_ticket"
disable RFC4507bis session ticket support.
.IP "\fB\-www\fR" 4
.IX Item "-www"
sends a status message back to the client when it connects. This includes
lots of information about the ciphers used and various session parameters.
The output is in \s-1HTML\s0 format so this option will normally be used with a
web browser.
.IP "\fB\-WWW\fR" 4
.IX Item "-WWW"
emulates a simple web server. Pages will be resolved relative to the
current directory, for example if the \s-1URL\s0 https://myhost/page.html is
requested the file ./page.html will be loaded.
.IP "\fB\-HTTP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-HTTP"
emulates a simple web server. Pages will be resolved relative to the
current directory, for example if the \s-1URL\s0 https://myhost/page.html is
requested the file ./page.html will be loaded. The files loaded are
assumed to contain a complete and correct \s-1HTTP\s0 response (lines that
are part of the \s-1HTTP\s0 response line and headers must end with \s-1CRLF\s0).
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBs_server\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
.IP "\fB\-id_prefix arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-id_prefix arg"
generate \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 session IDs prefixed by \fBarg\fR. This is mostly useful
for testing any \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 code (eg. proxies) that wish to deal with multiple
servers, when each of which might be generating a unique range of session
IDs (eg. with a certain prefix).
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.SH "CONNECTED COMMANDS"
.IX Header "CONNECTED COMMANDS"
If a connection request is established with an \s-1SSL\s0 client and neither the
\&\fB\-www\fR nor the \fB\-WWW\fR option has been used then normally any data received
from the client is displayed and any key presses will be sent to the client.
.PP
Certain single letter commands are also recognized which perform special
operations: these are listed below.
.IP "\fBq\fR" 4
.IX Item "q"
end the current \s-1SSL\s0 connection but still accept new connections.
.IP "\fBQ\fR" 4
.IX Item "Q"
end the current \s-1SSL\s0 connection and exit.
.IP "\fBr\fR" 4
.IX Item "r"
renegotiate the \s-1SSL\s0 session.
.IP "\fBR\fR" 4
.IX Item "R"
renegotiate the \s-1SSL\s0 session and request a client certificate.
.IP "\fBP\fR" 4
.IX Item "P"
send some plain text down the underlying \s-1TCP\s0 connection: this should
cause the client to disconnect due to a protocol violation.
.IP "\fBS\fR" 4
.IX Item "S"
print out some session cache status information.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
\&\fBs_server\fR can be used to debug \s-1SSL\s0 clients. To accept connections from
a web browser the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl s_server \-accept 443 \-www
.Ve
.PP
can be used for example.
.PP
Most web browsers (in particular Netscape and \s-1MSIE\s0) only support \s-1RSA\s0 cipher
suites, so they cannot connect to servers which don't use a certificate
carrying an \s-1RSA\s0 key or a version of OpenSSL with \s-1RSA\s0 disabled.
.PP
Although specifying an empty list of CAs when requesting a client certificate
is strictly speaking a protocol violation, some \s-1SSL\s0 clients interpret this to
mean any \s-1CA\s0 is acceptable. This is useful for debugging purposes.
.PP
The session parameters can printed out using the \fBsess_id\fR program.
.PP
\&\s-1TLS\s0 extensions are only supported in OpenSSL 0.9.8 if they are explictly
enabled at compile time using for example the \fBenable-tlsext\fR switch.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Because this program has a lot of options and also because some of
the techniques used are rather old, the C source of s_server is rather
hard to read and not a model of how things should be done. A typical
\&\s-1SSL\s0 server program would be much simpler.
.PP
The output of common ciphers is wrong: it just gives the list of ciphers that
OpenSSL recognizes and the client supports.
.PP
There should be a way for the \fBs_server\fR program to print out details of any
unknown cipher suites a client says it supports.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBs_client\fR command implements a generic \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 client which connects to a
remote host using \s-1SSL/TLS.\s0 It can request a page from the server and includes
the time to transfer the payload data in its timing measurements. It measures
the number of connections within a given timeframe, the amount of data
transferred (if any), and calculates the average time spent for one connection.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-connect host:port\fR" 4
.IX Item "-connect host:port"
This specifies the host and optional port to connect to.
.IP "\fB\-www page\fR" 4
.IX Item "-www page"
This specifies the page to \s-1GET\s0 from the server. A value of '/' gets the
index.htm[l] page. If this parameter is not specified, then \fBs_time\fR will only
perform the handshake to establish \s-1SSL\s0 connections but not transfer any
payload data.
.IP "\fB\-cert certname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cert certname"
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server. The default is
not to use a certificate. The file is in \s-1PEM\s0 format.
.IP "\fB\-key keyfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-key keyfile"
The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file will
be used. The file is in \s-1PEM\s0 format.
.IP "\fB\-verify depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify depth"
The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
server certificate chain and turns on server certificate verification.
Currently the verify operation continues after errors so all the problems
with a certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect the connection
will never fail due to a server certificate verify failure.
.IP "\fB\-CApath directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CApath directory"
The directory to use for server certificate verification. This directory
must be in \*(L"hash format\*(R", see \fBverify\fR for more information. These are
also used when building the client certificate chain.
.IP "\fB\-CAfile file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CAfile file"
A file containing trusted certificates to use during server authentication
and to use when attempting to build the client certificate chain.
.IP "\fB\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-new"
performs the timing test using a new session \s-1ID\s0 for each connection.
If neither \fB\-new\fR nor \fB\-reuse\fR are specified, they are both on by default
and executed in sequence.
.IP "\fB\-reuse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-reuse"
performs the timing test using the same session \s-1ID\s0; this can be used as a test
that session caching is working. If neither \fB\-new\fR nor \fB\-reuse\fR are
specified, they are both on by default and executed in sequence.
.IP "\fB\-nbio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nbio"
turns on non-blocking I/O.
.IP "\fB\-ssl2\fR, \fB\-ssl3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ssl2, -ssl3"
these options disable the use of certain \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1TLS\s0 protocols. By default
the initial handshake uses a method which should be compatible with all
servers and permit them to use \s-1SSL\s0 v3, \s-1SSL\s0 v2 or \s-1TLS\s0 as appropriate.
The timing program is not as rich in options to turn protocols on and off as
the \fIs_client\fR\|(1) program and may not connect to all servers.
.Sp
Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and broken servers in use which
cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect. Some servers only
work if \s-1TLS\s0 is turned off with the \fB\-ssl3\fR option; others
will only support \s-1SSL\s0 v2 and may need the \fB\-ssl2\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-bugs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-bugs"
there are several known bug in \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1TLS\s0 implementations. Adding this
option enables various workarounds.
.IP "\fB\-cipher cipherlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cipher cipherlist"
this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be modified. Although
the server determines which cipher suite is used it should take the first
supported cipher in the list sent by the client.
See the \fIciphers\fR\|(1) command for more information.
.IP "\fB\-time length\fR" 4
.IX Item "-time length"
specifies how long (in seconds) \fBs_time\fR should establish connections and
optionally transfer payload data from a server. Server and client performance
and the link speed determine how many connections \fBs_time\fR can establish.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
\&\fBs_client\fR can be used to measure the performance of an \s-1SSL\s0 connection.
To connect to an \s-1SSL HTTP\s0 server and get the default page the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\& openssl s_time \-connect servername:443 \-www / \-CApath yourdir \-CAfile yourfile.pem \-cipher commoncipher [\-ssl3]
.Ve
.PP
would typically be used (https uses port 443). 'commoncipher' is a cipher to
which both client and server can agree, see the \fIciphers\fR\|(1) command
for details.
.PP
If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it is
nothing obvious like no client certificate then the \fB\-bugs\fR, \fB\-ssl2\fR,
\&\fB\-ssl3\fR options can be tried
in case it is a buggy server. In particular you should play with these
options \fBbefore\fR submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL mailing list.
.PP
A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending
the clients certificate authority in its \*(L"acceptable \s-1CA\s0 list\*(R" when it
requests a certificate. By using \fIs_client\fR\|(1) the \s-1CA\s0 list can be
viewed and checked. However some servers only request client authentication
after a specific \s-1URL\s0 is requested. To obtain the list in this case it
is necessary to use the \fB\-prexit\fR option of \fIs_client\fR\|(1) and
send an \s-1HTTP\s0 request for an appropriate page.
.PP
If a certificate is specified on the command line using the \fB\-cert\fR
option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests
a client certificate. Therefor merely including a client certificate
on the command line is no guarantee that the certificate works.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Because this program does not have all the options of the
\&\fIs_client\fR\|(1) program to turn protocols on and off, you may not be
able to measure the performance of all protocols with all servers.
.PP
The \fB\-verify\fR option should really exit if the server verification
fails.

.Op Fl fullPaths
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl file Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sample
is a command-line tool for gathering data about the running behavior of a
process.  It suspends the process at specified intervals
(by default, every 1 millisecond), records the call stacks of all threads
in the process at that time, then resumes the process.  The analysis done by
.Nm sample
is called ``sampling'' because it only checks the state
of the program at the sampling points.  The analysis may miss execution of
some functions that are not executing during one of the samples, but
.Nm sample
still provides useful data about commonly executing functions.
.Pp
At the end of the
sampling duration, 
.Nm sample
produces a report showing which functions were
executing during the sampling.  The data is condensed into a call tree, showing
the functions seen on the stack and how they were called.  (This tree is a
subset of the actual call tree for the execution, since some functions may not
have been executing during any of the sampling events.)  The tree is displayed
textually, with called functions indented one level to the right of the callee.
.Pp
In the call tree, if a function calls more than one function then a vertical
line is printed to visually connect those separate children functions, making it
easier to see which functions are at the same level.  The characters used to
draw those lines, such as + | : ! are arbitrary and have no specific meaning.
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Pp
The user of sample specifies a target process (either by process id, or by name),
the duration of the sampling run (in seconds), and a sampling rate (in milliseconds).
.Pp
If the sampling duration is not specified, a default of 10 seconds is used.  Longer
sampling durations provide better data by collecting more samples, but could also be
confusing if the target process performs many different types of operations during
that period.
.Pp
The default sampling rate is 1 millisecond.  Fast sampling rates provide more samples
and a better chance to capture all the functions that are executing.
.Pp
.Fl wait
tells sample to wait for the process specified (usually as a partial name
or hint) to exist, then start sampling that process.  This option allows you
to sample from an application's launch.
.Pp 
.Fl mayDie 
tells sample to immediately grab the location of symbols from the
application, on the assumption that the application may exit or crash
at any point during the sampling.  
This ensures that sample can give information
about the call stacks even if the process no longer exists.
.Pp 
.Fl fullPaths
tells sample to show the full path to the source code (rather than just the file
name) for any symbol in a binary image for which debug information is available.
The full path was the path to the source code when the binary image was built.
.Pp
.Fl e
tells sample to open the output in TextEdit automatically when sampling completes.
.Pp
.Fl file Ar filename
tells sample the full path to where the output should be written.  If this flag
is not specified, results are written to a file in /tmp called <application name>_<date>_<time>.<XXXX>.sample.txt,
where each 'X' is replaced by a random alphanumeric character.

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm sar
command is used to sample and report various cumulative statistic counters
maintained by the operating system.
It can be invoked in two different ways.
.Pp
In the first usage instance,
.Ar n
samples are reported at
.Ar t
second intervals.
If
.Ar n
is not specified, only one sample will be captured.
When the -o option is specified,
.Nm sar
will write the binary sampling data to the output file specified by
.Ar filename .
.Pp
In the second usage instance,
there is no on-going sample interval to specify.
This is because the sampling input comes
from a previously recorded, binary activity file.
The binary activity file can be specified using the
.Fl f Ar filename
option.
When the
.Fl f
option isn't used,
.Nm sar
attempts to open a default binary activity file,
/var/log/sa/sadd, where
.Ar dd
represents the current day of the month.
.Pp
The starting and ending time of the report can be restricted using the
.Fl e
and
.Fl s
options.  Here, the
.Ar time
field is specified in the form hh[:mm[:ss]].
.Pp
Finally, the
.Fl i
option can be used to select the sampling interval.  
Only records at least
.Ar seconds
apart will be reported.
When the
.Fl i
option is not used,
all of the previously recorded interval samples are reported.
.Pp
Due to the nature of on-going sample collection,
the data is reported in a verbose mode
when more than one sampling option is specified.
Column headers are printed at the beginning of the report;
averages are printed when the 
.Nm sar
command terminates.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options restrict the sample set that
.Nm sar
reports.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space

mode must be specified in order to display ppp connections
in the network statistics. This will also turn on the PPP modify
mode in
.Ar sadc
(8) when sampling data is not being read from a file.
By default, both the collection and reporting of ppp
statistics is turned off.  See

file, if specified, will only contain audio for the last line of the input. 
Otherwise, text is spoken all at once.
.SH "AUDIO FORMATS"
.IX Header "AUDIO FORMATS"
Starting in MacOS X 10.6, file formats other than \s-1AIFF\s0 may be specified, although not all
third party synthesizers may initially support them. In simple cases, the file format can 
be inferred from the extension, although generally some of the options below are required 
for finer grained control:
.IP "\fB\-\-file\-format\fR=format" 4
.IX Item "--file-format=format"
The format of the file to write (\s-1AIFF,\s0 caff, m4af, \s-1WAVE\s0). Generally, it's easier to specify
a suitable file extension for the output file. To obtain a list of writable file formats,
specify '?' as the format name.
.IP "\fB\-\-data\-format\fR=format" 4
.IX Item "--data-format=format"

.IX Item "Sample size"
One of \fB8\fR, \fB16\fR, \fB24\fR, \fB32\fR, \fB64\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Most available file formats only support a subset of these sample formats.
.Sp
To obtain a list of audio data formats for a file format specified explicitly or by file name, specify '?' as the format name.
.Sp
The format identifier optionally can be followed by \fB\f(CB@samplerate\fB\fR and \fB/hexflags\fR for the format.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-channels\fR=channels" 4
.IX Item "--channels=channels"
The number of channels. This will generally be of limited use, as most speech synthesizers produce mono audio only.
.IP "\fB\-\-bit\-rate\fR=rate" 4
.IX Item "--bit-rate=rate"
The bit rate for formats like \s-1AAC.\s0 To obtain a list of valid bit rates, specify '?' as the rate. In practice, not all of these 
bit rates will be available for a given format.
.IP "\fB\-\-quality\fR=quality" 4
.IX Item "--quality=quality"
The audio converter quality level between 0 (lowest) and 127 (highest).

.Sh NAME
.Nm sc_usage
.Nd show system call usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sc_usage
.Op Fl c Ar codefile
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl s Ar interval
pid | cmd | 
.Fl E
execute
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sc_usage
displays an ongoing sample of system call and page fault usage statistics for
a given process in a
.Dq Li top-like
fashion.
It requires root privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to
operate.
.Pp
Page faults can be of the following types:
.Bl -tag -width CACHEHITTT -compact
.It PAGE_IN
page had to read from disk
.It ZERO_FILL
page was created and zero filled
.It COW
page was copied from another page
.It CACHE_HIT
page was found in the cache
.El
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
When the
.Fl c
option is specified, it expects a path to a 
.Ar codefile 
that
contains the mappings for the system calls.
This option overrides the default location of the system call codefile which
is found in /usr/share/misc/trace.codes.
.It Fl e
Specifying the
.Fl e
option generates output that is sorted by call count.
This overrides the default sort by time.
.It Fl l
The
.Fl l
option causes
.Nm sc_usage
to turn off its continuous window updating style of output and instead output
as a continuous scrolling of data.
.It Fl s
By default,
.Nm sc_usage
updates its output at one second intervals.
This sampling interval may be changed by specifying the
.Fl s
option.
Enter the
.Ar interval
in seconds.
.It pid | cmd | -E execute
The last argument must be a process id, a running command name, or using the
.Fl E
option, an execution path followed by optional arguments.
The system call usage data for the process or command is displayed.
If the
.Fl E
flag is used, sc_usage will launch the executable, pass along any optional
arguments and display system call usage date for that executable.
.El
.Pp
The data columns displayed are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width LAST_PATHNAME_WAITED_FOR -compact
.Pp
.It TYPE
the system call type
.It NUMBER
the system call count
.It CPU_TIME
the amount of cpu time consumed
.It WAIT_TIME
the absolute time the process is waiting
.It CURRENT_TYPE
the current system call type
.It LAST_PATHNAME_WAITED_FOR
for each active thread, the last pathname
that was referenced by a system call that blocked
.It CUR_WAIT_TIME
the cumulative time that a thread has been blocked
.It THRD#
the thread number
.It PRI
current scheduling priority
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm sc_usage
command also displays some global state in the first few lines of output,
including the number of preemptions, context switches, threads, faults and
system calls, found during the sampling period.
The current time and the elapsed time that the command has been running is also
displayed here.
The
.Nm sc_usage
command is also SIGWINCH savvy, so adjusting your window geometry may change
the list of system calls being displayed.
Typing a
.Sq Li q
will cause sc_usage to exit immediately.
Typing any other character will cause sc_usage to reset its counters and the
display.
.Sh SAMPLE USAGE
.Pp
sc_usage Finder -e -s2
.Pp
.Nm sc_usage
will sort the Finder process usage data according to system call count and
update the output at 2 second intervals.

\&\f(CW\*(C`PREREQ_PM\*(C'\fR section needed by modules.
.PP
If you have \fB\s-1CPANPLUS\s0\fR installed, modules that are part of an
earlier module's distribution with be denoted with \f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR; modules
without a distribution name on \s-1CPAN\s0 are marked with \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Also, if the \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR option is specified, module belongs to a perl
distribution on \s-1CPAN \s0(and thus uninstallable by \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS.pm\*(C'\fR) are marked with \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Finally, modules that has loadable shared object files (usually
needing a compiler to install) are marked with \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR; with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-V\*(C'\fR flag, those files (and all other files found) will be listed
before the main output. Additionally, all module files that the
scanned code depends on but were not found (and thus not scanned
recursively) are listed. These may include genuinely missing
modules or false positives. That means, modules your code does
not depend on (on this particular platform) but that were picked
up by the heuristic anyway.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-e \s-1STRING\s0" 4
.IX Item "-e STRING"
Scan \fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR as a string containing perl code.
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compiles the code and inspects its \f(CW%INC\fR, in addition to static scanning.
.IP "\-x" 4
.IX Item "-x"
Executes the code and inspects its \f(CW%INC\fR, in addition to static scanning.
.IP "\-B" 4
.IX Item "-B"
Include core modules in the output and the recursive search list.
.IP "\-R" 4
.IX Item "-R"
Only show dependencies found in the files listed and do not recurse.
.IP "\-V" 4
.IX Item "-V"
Verbose mode: Output all files found during the process; 
show dependencies between modules and availability.
.Sp
Additionally, warns of any missing dependencies. If you find missing
dependencies that aren't really dependencies, you have probably found
false positives.
.IP "\-C \s-1CACHEFILE\s0" 4
.IX Item "-C CACHEFILE"
Use \s-1CACHEFILE\s0 to speed up the scanning process by caching dependencies.
Creates \s-1CACHEFILE\s0 if it does not exist yet.

\&\fIscandeps.pl\fR is a simple-minded utility that prints out the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PREREQ_PM\*(C'\fR section needed by modules.
.PP
If you have \fB\s-1CPANPLUS\s0\fR installed, modules that are part of an
earlier module's distribution with be denoted with \f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR; modules
without a distribution name on \s-1CPAN\s0 are marked with \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Also, if the \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR option is specified, module belongs to a perl
distribution on \s-1CPAN \s0(and thus uninstallable by \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS.pm\*(C'\fR) are marked with \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Finally, modules that has loadable shared object files (usually
needing a compiler to install) are marked with \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR; with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-V\*(C'\fR flag, those files (and all other files found) will be listed
before the main output. Additionally, all module files that the
scanned code depends on but were not found (and thus not scanned
recursively) are listed. These may include genuinely missing
modules or false positives. That means, modules your code does
not depend on (on this particular platform) but that were picked
up by the heuristic anyway.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-e \s-1STRING\s0" 4
.IX Item "-e STRING"
Scan \fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR as a string containing perl code.
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compiles the code and inspects its \f(CW%INC\fR, in addition to static scanning.
.IP "\-x" 4
.IX Item "-x"
Executes the code and inspects its \f(CW%INC\fR, in addition to static scanning.
.IP "\-B" 4
.IX Item "-B"
Include core modules in the output and the recursive search list.
.IP "\-R" 4
.IX Item "-R"
Only show dependencies found in the files listed and do not recurse.
.IP "\-V" 4
.IX Item "-V"
Verbose mode: Output all files found during the process; 
show dependencies between modules and availability.
.Sp
Additionally, warns of any missing dependencies. If you find missing
dependencies that aren't really dependencies, you have probably found
false positives.
.IP "\-C \s-1CACHEFILE\s0" 4
.IX Item "-C CACHEFILE"
Use \s-1CACHEFILE\s0 to speed up the scanning process by caching dependencies.
Creates \s-1CACHEFILE\s0 if it does not exist yet.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies files between hosts on a network.
It uses
.Xr ssh 1
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Nm
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.
.Pp
File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate
that the file is to be copied to/from that host.
Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames
to avoid
.Nm
treating file names containing
.Sq :\&
as host specifiers.
Copies between two remote hosts are also permitted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1
Forces
.Nm
to use protocol 1.
.It Fl 2
Forces
.Nm
to use protocol 2.
.It Fl 3
Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host.
Without this option the data is copied directly between the two remote
hosts.
Note that this option disables the progress meter.
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl B
Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
.It Fl C
Compression enable.
Passes the
.Fl C
flag to
.Xr ssh 1
to enable compression.
.It Fl E
Preserves extended attributes, resource forks, and ACLs.  Requires both ends to be running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
.It Fl c Ar cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl F Ar ssh_config
Specifies an alternative
per-user configuration file for
.Nm ssh .
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl i Ar identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key
authentication is read.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl l Ar limit
Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
.It Fl o Ar ssh_option
Can be used to pass options to
.Nm ssh
in the format used in
.Xr ssh_config 5 .
This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate
.Nm scp
command-line flag.
For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
.Xr ssh_config 5 .

.El
.It Fl P Ar port
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
Note that this option is written with a capital
.Sq P ,
because
.Fl p
is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.
.It Fl p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic
messages from
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl r
Recursively copy entire directories.
Note that
.Nm
follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

Name of
.Ar program
to use for the encrypted connection.
The program must understand
.Xr ssh 1
options.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Causes

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Screen
is a full-screen window manager that
multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes (typically
interactive shells).
Each virtual terminal provides the functions
of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions
from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards
(e.\|g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a
copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between
windows.
.PP
When
.I screen
is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified
command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you
normally would.
Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other programs
in them (including more shells), kill existing windows, view a list of
windows, turn output logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between
windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows
in whatever manner you wish, etc. All windows run their programs completely
independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window
is currently not visible and even when the whole 
.I screen 
session is detached from the user's terminal.  When a program terminates,
.I screen
(per default) kills the window that contained it.
If this window was in the foreground, the display switches to the previous
window; if none are left,
.I screen
exits.
.PP
Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current window.
The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate
a command to the window manager.
By default, each command begins with a control-a (abbreviated C-a from
now on), and is followed by one other keystroke.
The command character and all the key bindings can be fully customized
to be anything you like, though they are always two characters in length.
.PP
.I Screen
does not understand the prefix \*QC-\*U to mean control. 
Please use the caret notation (\*Q^A\*U instead of \*QC-a\*U) as arguments
to e.g. the 
.I escape
command or the \fI-e\fP option.
.I Screen
will also print out control characters in caret notation.
.PP
The standard way to create a new window is to type \*QC-a c\*U.
This creates a new window running a shell and switches to that
window immediately, regardless of the state of the process running
in the current window.
Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom command in it by
first binding the command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or at the
\*QC-a :\*U command line) and
then using it just like the \*QC-a c\*U command.
In addition, new windows can be created by running a command like:
.IP
screen emacs prog.c
.PP
from a shell prompt within a previously created window.
This will not run another copy of
.IR screen ,
but will instead supply the command name and its arguments to the window
manager (specified in the $STY environment variable) who will use it to
create the new window.
The above example would start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch
to its window.
.PP
If \*Q/etc/utmp\*U is writable by
.IR screen ,
an appropriate record will be written to this file for each window, and
removed when the window is terminated.
This is useful for working with \*Qtalk\*U, \*Qscript\*U, \*Qshutdown\*U,
\*Qrsend\*U, \*Qsccs\*U and other similar programs that use the utmp
file to determine who you are. As long as
.I screen
is active on your terminal,
the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp file. See also \*QC-a L\*U.


.SH GETTING STARTED
Before you begin to use
.I screen
you'll need to make sure you have correctly selected your terminal type,
just as you would for any other termcap/terminfo program.
(You can do this by using
.IR tset
for example.)
.PP
If you're impatient and want to get started without doing a lot more reading,
you should remember this one command:  \*QC-a ?\*U.
Typing these two characters will display a list of the available
.I screen
commands and their bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in
the section \*QDEFAULT KEY BINDINGS\*U. The manual section \*QCUSTOMIZATION\*U
deals with the contents of your .screenrc.
.PP
If your terminal is a \*Qtrue\*U auto-margin terminal (it doesn't allow
the last position on the screen to be updated without scrolling the
screen) consider using a version of your terminal's termcap that has
automatic margins turned \fIoff\fP. This will ensure an accurate and
optimal update of the screen in all circumstances. Most terminals
nowadays have \*Qmagic\*U margins (automatic margins plus usable last
column). This is the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for
.IR screen .
If all you've got is a \*Qtrue\*U auto-margin terminal 
.I screen
will be content to use it, but updating a character put into the last
position on the screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls or
the character is moved into a safe position in some other way. This
delay can be shortened by using a terminal with insert-character
capability.


.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
Screen has the following command-line options:
.TP 5
.B \-a
include \fIall\fP capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each
window's termcap, even if
.I screen
must redraw parts of the display in order to implement a function.
.TP 5
.B \-A
Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the current terminal.
By default,
.I screen
tries to restore its old window sizes when attaching to resizable terminals
(those with \*QWS\*U in its description, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).
.TP 5
.BI "\-c " file
override the default configuration file from \*Q$HOME/.screenrc\*U
to \fIfile\fP.
.TP 5
.BR \-d | \-D " [" \fIpid.tty.host ]
does not start
.IR screen ,
but detaches the elsewhere running
.I screen
session. It has the same effect as typing \*QC-a d\*U from
.IR screen 's
controlling terminal. \fB\-D\fP is the equivalent to the power detach key.
If no session can be detached, this option is ignored. In combination with the
\fB\-r\fP/\fB\-R\fP option more powerful effects can be achieved:
.TP 8
.B \-d \-r
Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
.TP 8
.B \-d \-R
Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
.TP 8
.B \-d \-RR
Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first
session if more than one session is available.

Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.
.TP 8
.B \-D \-R
Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then
reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.
If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the
author's favorite.
.TP 8
.B \-D \-RR
Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.
.IP "" 5
Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of your sessions by means of
\*Qscreen \-list\*U.
.TP 5
.BI "\-e " xy
specifies the command character to be \fIx\fP and the character generating a
literal command character to \fIy\fP (when typed after the command character).
The default is \*QC-a\*U and `a', which can be specified as \*Q-e^Aa\*U.
When creating a
.I screen
session, this option sets the default command character. In a multiuser
session all users added will start off with this command character. But
when attaching to an already running session, this option changes only
the command character of the attaching user.
This option is equivalent to either the commands \*Qdefescape\*U or
\*Qescape\*U respectively.
.TP 5
.BR \-f\fP ", " \-fn ", and " \-fa
turns flow-control on, off, or \*Qautomatic switching mode\*U.
This can also be defined through the \*Qdefflow\*U .screenrc command.
.TP 5
.BI "\-h " num
Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be \fInum\fP lines high.
.TP 5
.B \-i
will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display
immediately when flow-control is on.
See the \*Qdefflow\*U .screenrc command for details.
The use of this option is discouraged.
.TP 5
.BR \-l " and " \-ln
turns login mode on or off (for /etc/utmp updating).
This can also be defined through the \*Qdeflogin\*U .screenrc command.
.TP 5
.BR \-ls " and " \-list
does not start
.IR screen ,
but prints a list of
.I pid.tty.host
strings identifying your
.I screen
sessions.
Sessions marked `detached' can be resumed with \*Qscreen -r\*U. Those marked
`attached' are running and have a controlling terminal. If the session runs in 
multiuser mode, it is marked `multi'. Sessions marked as `unreachable' either
live on a different host or are `dead'.
An unreachable session is considered dead, when its name
matches either the name of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any.
See the \fB-r\fP flag for a description how to construct matches.
Sessions marked as `dead' should be thoroughly checked and removed. 
Ask your system administrator if you are not sure. Remove sessions with the 
\fB-wipe\fP option. 
.TP 5
.B \-L
tells
.I screen
to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.
.TP 5
.B \-m
causes
.I screen
to ignore the $STY environment variable. With \*Qscreen -m\*U creation of
a new session is enforced, regardless whether
.I screen
is called from within another
.I screen
session or not. This flag has a special meaning in connection
with the `-d' option:
.TP 8
.B \-d \-m
Start
.I screen
in \*Qdetached\*U mode. This creates a new session but doesn't
attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.
.TP 8
.B \-D \-m
This also starts screen in \*Qdetached\*U mode, but doesn't fork
a new process. The command exits if the session terminates.
.TP 5
.B \-O
selects a more optimal output mode for your terminal rather than true VT100
emulation (only affects auto-margin terminals without `LP').
This can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP' in a \*Qtermcap\*U
command.
.TP 5
.BI "\-p " number_or_name
Preselect a window. This is usefull when you want to reattach to a
specific windor or you want to send a command via the \*Q-X\*U
option to a specific window. As with screen's select commant, \*Q-\*U
selects the blank window. As a special case for reattach, \*Q=\*U
brings up the windowlist on the blank window.
.TP 5
.B \-q
Suppress printing of error messages. In combination with \*Q-ls\*U the exit 
value is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without sessions. 10 
indicates a directory with running but not attachable sessions. 11 (or more) 
indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.
In combination with \*Q-r\*U the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates that 
there is no session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there are 2 (or 
more) sessions to resume and you should specify which one to choose. 
In all other cases \*Q-q\*U has no effect.
.TP 5

.TP 5
.BR \-r " \fIsessionowner/[" \fIpid.tty.host ]
.PD
resumes a detached
.I screen
session.  No other options (except combinations with \fB\-d\fP/\fB\-D\fP) may
be specified, though an optional prefix of [\fIpid.\fP]\fItty.host\fP
may be needed to distinguish between multiple detached
.I screen
sessions.  The second form is used to connect to another user's screen session
which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates that screen should look for
sessions in another user's directory. This requires setuid-root.
.TP 5
.B \-R
attempts to resume the first detached
.I screen
session it finds.  If successful, all other command-line options are ignored.
If no detached session exists, starts a new session using the specified
options, just as if
.B \-R
had not been specified. The option is set by default if
.I screen
is run as a login-shell (actually screen uses \*Q-xRR\*U in that case).
For combinations with the \fB\-d\fP/\fB\-D\fP option see there.
.TP 5
.B \-s
sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the value
in the environment variable $SHELL (or \*Q/bin/sh\*U if not defined).
This can also be defined through the \*Qshell\*U .screenrc command.
.TP 5
.BI "\-S " sessionname
When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a
meaningful name for the session. This name identifies the session for
\*Qscreen -list\*U and \*Qscreen -r\*U actions. It substitutes the
default [\fItty.host\fP] suffix.
.TP 5
.BI "\-t " name
sets the title (a.\|k.\|a.) for the default shell or specified program.
See also the \*Qshelltitle\*U .screenrc command.
.TP 5
.B \-U
Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your terminal
sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the default
encoding for new windows to `utf8'.
.TP 5
.B \-v
Print version number.
.TP 5
.BR \-wipe " [" \fImatch ]
does the same as \*Qscreen -ls\*U, but removes destroyed sessions instead of
marking them as `dead'.
An unreachable session is considered dead, when its name matches either 
the name of the local host, or the explicitly given parameter, if any.
See the \fB-r\fP flag for a description how to construct matches.
.TP 5
.B \-x
Attach to a not detached
.I screen
session. (Multi display mode).
.TP 5
.B \-X
Send the specified command to a running screen session. You can use
the \fB-d\fP or \fB-r\fP option to tell screen to look only for
attached or detached screen sessions. Note that this command doesn't
work if the session is password protected.


.SH "DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS"
.ta 12n 26n
As mentioned, each
.I screen
command consists of a
\*QC-a\*U followed by one other character.
For your convenience, all commands that are bound to lower-case letters are
also bound to their control character counterparts (with the exception
of \*QC-a a\*U; see below), thus, \*QC-a c\*U as well as \*QC-a C-c\*U can
be used to create a window. See section \*QCUSTOMIZATION\*U for a description
of the command.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
The \*Qsocket directory\*U defaults either to $HOME/.screen or simply to
/tmp/screens or preferably to /usr/local/screens chosen at compile-time. If
.I screen
is installed setuid-root, then the administrator
should compile
.I screen
with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If
.I screen
is not running setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700 directory
in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.
.PP
When
.I screen
is invoked, it executes initialization commands from the files
\*Q/usr/local/etc/screenrc\*U and
\*Q.screenrc\*U in the user's home directory. These are the \*Qprogrammer's
defaults\*U that can be overridden in the following ways: for the
global screenrc file 
.I screen
searches for the environment variable $SYSSCREENRC (this override feature
may be disabled at compile-time). The user specific
screenrc file is searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.
The command line option \fB-c\fP takes
precedence over the above user screenrc files.
.PP
Commands in these files are used to set options, bind functions to
keys, and to automatically establish one or more windows at the
beginning of your
.I screen
session.
Commands are listed one per line, with empty lines being ignored.
A command's arguments are separated by tabs or spaces, and may be
surrounded by single or double quotes.
A `#' turns the rest of the line into a comment, except in quotes.
Unintelligible lines are warned about and ignored.
Commands may contain references to environment variables. The 
syntax is the shell-like "$VAR " or "${VAR}". Note that this causes 
incompatibility with previous 
.I screen
versions, as now the '$'-character has to be protected with '\e' if no
variable substitution shall be performed. A string in single-quotes is also
protected from variable substitution.
.PP
Two configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen distribution:
\*Qetc/screenrc\*U and \*Qetc/etcscreenrc\*U. They contain a number of
useful examples for various commands.
.PP
Customization can also be done 'on-line'. To enter the command mode type
`C-a :'. Note that commands starting with \*Qdef\*U change default values,
while others change current settings.
.PP
The following commands are available:
.sp 
.ne 3
.BI acladd " usernames"
.RI [ crypted-pw ]
.br
.BI addacl " usernames"
.PP
Enable users to fully access this screen session. \fIUsernames\fP can be one
user or a comma separated list of users. This command enables to attach to the
.I screen
session and performs the equivalent of `aclchg \fIusernames\fP +rwx \&"#?\&"'.
executed. To add a user with restricted access, use the `aclchg' command below.
If an optional second parameter is supplied, it should be a crypted password
for the named user(s). `Addacl' is a synonym to `acladd'.
Multi user mode only.
.sp 
.ne 3
.BI aclchg " usernames permbits list"
.br
.BI chacl " usernames permbits list"
.PP
Change permissions for a comma separated list of users. Permission bits are
represented as `r', `w' and `x'. Prefixing `+' grants the permission, `-' 
removes it. The third parameter is a comma separated list of commands and/or
windows (specified either by number or title). The special list `#' refers to 
all windows, `?' to all commands. if \fIusernames\fP consists of a single `*',
all known users are affected.
A command can be executed when the user has the `x' bit for it.
The user can type input to a window when he has its `w' bit set and no other
user obtains a writelock for this window. 
Other bits are currently ignored.  
To withdraw the writelock from another user in window 2:
`aclchg \fIusername\fP -w+w 2'.
To allow read-only access to the session: `aclchg \fIusername\fP
-w \&"#\&"'. As soon as a user's name is known to 
.I screen 
he can attach to the session and (per default) has full permissions for all 
command and windows. Execution permission for the acl commands, `at' and others
should also be removed or the user may be able to regain write permission.
Rights of the special username
.B nobody
cannot be changed (see the \*Qsu\*U command).
`Chacl' is a synonym to `aclchg'.
Multi user mode only.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI acldel " username"
.PP
Remove a user from
.IR screen 's
access control list. If currently attached, all the
user's displays are detached from the session. He cannot attach again.
Multi user mode only.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI aclgrp " username"
.RI [ groupname ]
.PP
Creates groups of users that share common access rights. The name of the 
group is the username of the group leader. Each member of the group inherits
the permissions that are granted to the group leader. That means, if a user
fails an access check, another check is made for the group leader.
A user is removed from all groups the special value \*Qnone\*U is used for
.IR groupname .
If the second parameter is omitted all groups the user is in are listed.
.sp
.ne 3
.B aclumask
.RI [[ users ] +bits 
.RI |[ users ] -bits " .... ]"
.br
.B umask
.RI [[ users ] +bits 
.RI |[ users ] -bits " .... ]"
.PP
This specifies the access other users have to windows that will be created by
the caller of the command.
.I Users
may be no, one or a comma separated list of known usernames. If no users are
specified, a list of all currently known users is assumed. 
.I Bits
is any combination of access control bits allowed defined with the 
\*Qaclchg\*U command. The special username \*Q?\*U predefines the access
that not yet known users will be granted to any window initially.
The special username \*Q??\*U predefines the access that not yet known 
users are granted to any command. 
Rights of the special username
.B nobody
cannot be changed (see the \*Qsu\*U command).
`Umask' is a synonym to `aclumask'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI activity " message"
.PP
When any activity occurs in a background window that is being monitored,
.I screen
displays a notification in the message line.
The notification message can be re-defined by means of the \*Qactivity\*U
command.
Each occurrence of `%' in \fImessage\fP is replaced by
the number of the window in which activity has occurred,
and each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for bell
in your termcap (usually an audible bell).
The default message is
.sp
	'Activity in window %n'
.sp
Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default, but can be altered
by use of the \*Qmonitor\*U command (C-a M).
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "allpartial on" | off
.PP
If set to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed on window change.
This affects all windows and is useful for slow terminal lines. The 
previous setting of full/partial refresh for each window is restored
with \*Qallpartial off\*U.  This is a global flag that immediately takes effect
on all windows overriding the \*Qpartial\*U settings. It does not change the
default redraw behavior of newly created windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "altscreen on" | off
.PP
If set to on, "alternate screen" support is enabled in virtual terminals,
just like in xterm.  Initial setting is `off'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "at " "[\fIidentifier\fP][" "#\fP|\fP*\fP|\fP%\fP] "
.IR "command " [ args " ... ]"
.PP
Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it had been entered there.
\*QAt\*U changes the context (the `current window' or `current display'
setting) of the command. If the first parameter describes a 
non-unique context, the command will be executed multiple times. If the first 
parameter is of the form `\fIidentifier\fP*' then identifier is matched against
user names.  The command is executed once for each display of the selected 
user(s). If the first parameter is of the form `\fIidentifier\fP%' identifier 
is matched against displays. Displays are named after the ttys they 
attach. The prefix `/dev/' or `/dev/tty' may be omitted from the identifier.
If \fIidentifier\fP has a `#' or nothing appended it is matched against 
window numbers and titles. Omitting an identifier in front of the `#', `*' or 
`%'-character selects all users, displays or windows because a prefix-match is
performed. Note that on the affected display(s) a short message will describe
what happened. Permission is checked for initiator of the \*Qat\*U command,
not for the owners of the affected display(s).
Note that the '#' character works as a comment introducer when it is preceded by
whitespace. This can be escaped by prefixing a '\e'. 
Permission is checked for the initiator of the \*Qat\*U command, not for the
owners of the affected display(s).
.br
Caveat: 
When matching against windows, the command is executed at least 
once per window. Commands that change the internal arrangement of windows
(like \*Qother\*U) may be called again. In shared windows the command will
be repeated for each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle commands
like \*Qlogin\*U!
Some commands (e.g. \*Qprocess\*U) require that 
a display is associated with the target windows.  These commands may not work
correctly under \*Qat\*U looping over windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "attrcolor " attrib
.RI [ "attribute/color-modifier" ]
.PP
This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the color of
the text. If the attribute
.I attrib
is in use, the specified attribute/color modifier is also applied. If no
modifier is given, the current one is deleted. See the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U
chapter for the syntax of the modifier. Screen understands two
pseudo-attributes, \*Qi\*U stands for high-intensity foreground
color and \*QI\*U for high-intensity background color.
.sp
Examples:
.IP
attrcolor b "R"
.PP
Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed.
.IP
attrcolor u "-u b"
.PP
Use blue text instead of underline.
.IP
attrcolor b ".I"
.PP
Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do this
already.
.IP
attrcolor i "+b"
.PP
Make bright colored text also bold.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "autodetach on" | off
.PP
Sets whether 
.I screen
will automatically detach upon hangup, which
saves all your running programs until they are resumed with a
.B "screen -r"
command.
When turned off, a hangup signal will terminate 
.I screen
and all the processes it contains. Autodetach is on by default.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "autonuke on" | off
.PP
Sets whether a clear screen sequence should nuke all the output
that has not been written to the terminal. See also
\*Qobuflimit\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "backtick " id
.I lifespan
.I autorefresh
.I cmd
.I args...
.br
.BI "backtick " id
.PP
Program the backtick command with the numerical id \fIid\fP.
The output of such a command is used for substitution of the
\*Q%`\*U string escape. The specified \fIlifespan\fP is the number
of seconds the output is considered valid. After this time, the
command is run again if a corresponding string escape is encountered.
The \fIautorefresh\fP parameter triggers an
automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after the
specified number of seconds. Only the last line of output is used
for substitution.
.br
If both the \fIlifespan\fP and the \fIautorefresh\fP parameters
are zero, the backtick program is expected to stay in the
background and generate output once in a while.
In this case, the command is executed right away and screen stores
the last line of output. If a new line gets printed screen will
automatically refresh the hardstatus or the captions.
.br
The second form of the command deletes the backtick command
with the numerical id \fIid\fP.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "bce " [ on | off ]
.PP
Change background-color-erase setting. If \*Qbce\*U is set to on, all
characters cleared by an erase/insert/scroll/clear operation
will be displayed in the current background color. Otherwise
the default background color is used.
.sp
.ne 3
.B bell_msg
.RI [ message ]

When a bell character is sent to a background window,
.I screen
displays a notification in the message line.
The notification message can be re-defined by this command.
Each occurrence of `%' in \fImessage\fP is replaced by
the number of the window to which a bell has been sent,
and each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for bell
in your termcap (usually an audible bell).
The default message is
.sp
	'Bell in window %n'
.sp
An empty message can be supplied to the \*Qbell_msg\*U command to suppress
output of a message line (bell_msg "").
Without parameter, the current message is shown.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "bind "
.RB [ -c
.IR class ]
.I key 
.RI [ command " [" args ]]
.PP
Bind a command to a key.
By default, most of the commands provided by
.I screen
are bound to one or more keys as indicated in the \*QDEFAULT KEY BINDINGS\*U
section, e.\|g. the
command to create a new window is bound to \*QC-c\*U and \*Qc\*U.
The \*Qbind\*U command can be used to redefine the key bindings and to
define new bindings.
The \fIkey\fP argument is either a single character, a two-character sequence
of the form \*Q^x\*U (meaning \*QC-x\*U), a backslash followed by an octal
number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed
by a second character, such as \*Q\e^\*U or \*Q\e\e\*U.
The argument can also be quoted, if you like.
If no further argument is given, any previously established binding
for this key is removed.
The \fIcommand\fP argument can be any command listed in this section.

If a command class is specified via the \*Q-c\*U option, the key
is bound for the specified class. Use the \*Qcommand\*U command
to activate a class. Command classes can be used to create multiple
command keys or multi-character bindings.
.PP
Some examples:
.PP
.nf
	bind ' ' windows
	bind ^k
	bind k
	bind K kill
	bind ^f screen telnet foobar
	bind \e033 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su
.fi
.PP
would bind the space key to the command that displays a list
of windows (so that the command usually invoked by \*QC-a C-w\*U
would also be available as \*QC-a space\*U). The next three lines
remove the default kill binding from \*QC-a C-k\*U and \*QC-a k\*U. 
\*QC-a K\*U is then bound to the kill command. Then it
binds \*QC-f\*U to the command \*Qcreate a window with a TELNET
connection to foobar\*U, and bind \*Qescape\*U to the command
that creates an non-login window with a.\|k.\|a. \*Qroot\*U in slot #9, with
a superuser shell and a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.
.PP
.nf
	bind -c demo1 0 select 10
	bind -c demo1 1 select 11
	bind -c demo1 2 select 12
	bindkey "^B" command -c demo1
.fi
.PP
makes \*QC-b 0\*U select window 10, \*QC-b 1\*U window 11, etc.
.PP
.nf
	bind -c demo2 0 select 10
	bind -c demo2 1 select 11
	bind -c demo2 2 select 12
	bind - command -c demo2

.ne 3
.B bindkey
.RB [ -d ]
.RB [ -m ]
.RB [ -a ]
.RB [[ -k | -t ]
.I string
.RI [ "cmd args" ]]
.PP
This command manages screen's input translation tables. Every
entry in one of the tables tells screen how to react if a certain
sequence of characters is encountered. There are three tables:
one that should contain actions programmed by the user, one for
the default actions used for terminal emulation and one for
screen's copy mode to do cursor movement. See section
\*QINPUT TRANSLATION\*U for a list of default key bindings.
.br
If the
.B -d
option is given, bindkey modifies the default table,
.B -m
changes the copy mode table
and with neither option the user table is selected.
The argument
.I string
is the sequence of characters to which an action is bound. This
can either be a fixed string or a termcap keyboard capability
name (selectable with the
.B -k
option).
.br
Some keys on a VT100 terminal can send a different
string if application mode is turned on (e.g the cursor keys).
Such keys have two entries in the translation table. You can
select the application mode entry by specifying the
.B -a
option.
.br
The
.B -t
option tells screen not to do inter-character timing. One cannot
turn off the timing if a termcap capability is used.
.br
.I Cmd
can be any of screen's commands with an arbitrary number of
.IR args .
If
.I cmd
is omitted the key-binding is removed from the table.
.br
Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:
.sp
.nf
        bindkey -d
.fi
Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode entries
are marked with [A].
.sp
.nf
        bindkey -k k1 select 1
.fi
Make the "F1" key switch to window one.
.sp
.nf
        bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo
.fi
Make "foo" an abbreviation of the word "barfoo". Timeout is disabled
so that users can type slowly.
.sp
.nf
        bindkey "\e024" mapdefault
.fi
This key-binding makes \*Q^T\*U an escape character for key-bindings. If
you did the above \*Qstuff barfoo\*U binding, you can enter the word
\*Qfoo\*U by typing \*Q^Tfoo\*U. If you want to insert a \*Q^T\*U
you have to press the key twice (i.e. escape the escape binding).
.sp
.nf
        bindkey -k F1 command
.fi
Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen
escape (besides ^A).
.sp
.ne 3
.B break
.RI [ duration ]
.PP
Send a break signal for \fIduration\fP*0.25 seconds to this window.
For non-Posix systems the time interval may be rounded up to full seconds.
Most useful if a character device is attached to the window rather than 
a shell process (See also chapter \*QWINDOW TYPES\*U). The maximum duration of
a break signal is limited to 15 seconds.
.sp
.ne 3
.B blanker
.PP
Activate the screen blanker. First the screen is cleared. If no blanker
program is defined, the cursor is turned off, otherwise, the 
program is started and it's output is written to the screen.
The screen blanker is killed with the first keypress, the read key
is discarded.
.br
This command is normally used together with the \*Qidle\*U command.
.sp
.ne 3
.B blankerprg
.RI [ "program args" ]
.PP
Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program if no
arguments are given.
.sp
.ne 3
.B breaktype
.RI [ tcsendbreak | TIOCSBRK
.RI | TCSBRK ]
.PP
Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal for
terminal devices. This command should affect the current window only.
But it still behaves identical to \*Qdefbreaktype\*U. This will be changed in
the future.
Calling \*Qbreaktype\*U with no parameter displays the break method for the
current window.
.sp
.ne 3
.B bufferfile
.RI [ exchange-file ]
.PP
Change the filename used for reading and writing with the paste buffer.
If the optional argument to the \*Qbufferfile\*U command is omitted, 
the default setting (\*Q/tmp/screen-exchange\*U) is reactivated.
The following example will paste the system's password file into 
the
.I screen
window (using the paste buffer, where a copy remains):
.PP
.nf
	C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd
	C-a < C-a ]
	C-a : bufferfile
.fi
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "c1 " [ on | off ]
.PP
Change c1 code processing. \*QC1 on\*U tells screen to treat
the input characters between 128 and 159 as control functions.
Such an 8-bit code is normally the same as ESC followed by the
corresponding 7-bit code. The default setting is to process c1
codes and can be changed with the \*Qdefc1\*U command. 
Users with fonts that have usable characters in the
c1 positions may want to turn this off.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "caption always" | splitonly
.RI [ string ]
.br
.B "caption string"
.RI [ string ]
.PP
This command controls the display of the window captions. Normally
a caption is only used if more than one window is shown on the
display (split screen mode). But if the type is set to
.B always
screen shows a caption even if only one window is displayed. The default
is
.BR splitonly .
.P
The second form changes the text used for the caption. You can use
all escapes from the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U chapter. Screen uses
a default of `%3n %t'.
.P
You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional argument.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "charset " set
.PP
Change the current character set slot designation and charset
mapping.  The first four character of
.I set
are treated as charset designators while the fifth and sixth
character must be in range '0' to '3' and set the GL/GR charset
mapping. On every position a '.' may be used to indicate that
the corresponding charset/mapping should not be changed
(\fIset\fP is padded to six characters internally by appending '.'
chars). New windows have "BBBB02" as default charset, unless a
\*Qencoding\*U command is active.
.br
The current setting can be viewed with the \*Qinfo\*U command.
.sp
.ne 3
.B chdir
.RI [ directory ]
.PP
Change the \fIcurrent directory\fP of
.I screen
to the specified directory or, if called without an argument,
to your home directory (the value of the environment variable $HOME).
All windows that are created by means of the \*Qscreen\*U command
from within \*Q.screenrc\*U or by means of \*QC-a : screen ...\*U
or \*QC-a c\*U use this as their default directory.
Without a chdir command, this would be the directory from which
.I screen
was invoked.
Hardcopy and log files are always written to the \fIwindow's\fP default
directory, \fInot\fP the current directory of the process running in the
window.
You can use this command multiple times in your .screenrc to start various
windows in different default directories, but the last chdir value will
affect all the windows you create interactively.
.sp
.ne 3
.B clear
.PP
Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback buffer.
.sp
.ne 3
.B colon
.RI [ prefix ]
.PP
Allows you to enter \*Q.screenrc\*U command lines. Useful 
for on-the-fly modification of key bindings, 
specific window creation and changing settings. Note that the \*Qset\*U
keyword no longer exists! Usually commands affect the current window rather 
than default settings for future windows. Change defaults with commands
starting with 'def...'. 

If you consider this as the `Ex command mode' of 
.IR screen ,
you may regard \*QC-a esc\*U (copy mode) as its `Vi command mode'.
.sp 
.ne 3
.B command
.RB [ -c
.IR class ]
.PP
This command has the same effect as typing the screen escape
character (^A). It is probably only useful for key bindings.
If the \*Q-c\*U option is given, select the specified command
class.  See also \*Qbind\*U and \*Qbindkey\*U.
.sp 
.ne 3
.BR "compacthist " [ on | off ]
.PP
This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines when
scrolling up text into the history buffer.
.sp 
.ne 3
.BR "console " [ on | off ]
.PP
Grabs or un-grabs the machines console output to a window.
.IR Note :
Only the owner of /dev/console can grab the console output.
This command is only available if the machine supports the ioctl TIOCCONS.
.sp
.ne 3
.B copy
.PP
Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text from the current
window and its history into the paste buffer. In this mode a vi-like
`full screen editor' is active:
.br
.IR "Movement keys" :
.br
.in +4n
.ti -2n
\fBh\fP, \fBj\fP, \fBk\fP, \fBl\fP move the cursor line by line or 
column by column.
.br
.ti -2n
\fB0\fP, \fB^\fP and \fB$\fP move to the leftmost column, to the first or last
non-whitespace character on the line.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBH\fP, \fBM\fP and \fBL\fP move the cursor to the leftmost column
of the top, center or bottom line of the window. 
.br
.ti -2n
\fB+\fP and \fB\-\fP positions one line up and down.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBG\fP moves to the specified absolute line (default: end of buffer).
.br 
.ti -2n
\fB|\fP moves to the specified absolute column.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBw\fP, \fBb\fP, \fBe\fP move the cursor word by word.
.br 
.ti -2n
\fBB\fP, \fBE\fP move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi).
.br 
.ti -2n
\fBC-u\fP and \fBC-d\fP scroll the display up/down by the specified amount of 
lines while preserving the cursor position. (Default: half screen-full). 
.br
.ti -2n
\fBC-b\fP and \fBC-f\fP scroll the display up/down a full screen.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBg\fP moves to the beginning of the buffer.
.br
.ti -2n
\fB%\fP jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer.
.br
.ti -4n

.IR Note :
.br
Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a .screenrc command.
(E.\|g. markkeys "h=^B:l=^F:$=^E") There is no simple method for a full 
emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-character codes.

.br
.ti -4n
.IR Marking :
.br
The copy range is specified by setting two marks. The text between these marks 
will be highlighted. Press 
.br
.ti -2n
\fBspace\fP to set the first or second mark
respectively.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBY\fP and \fBy\fP used to mark one whole line or to mark from 
start of line.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBW\fP marks exactly one word. 
.br 
.ti -4n
.IR "Repeat count" :
.br
Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count number by pressing 
digits 
.br
.ti -2n
\fB0\fP..\fB9\fP which
is taken as a repeat count. 
.br
Example: \*QC-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y\*U will copy lines
11 to 15 into the paste buffer.
.br
.ti -4n
.IR Searching :
.ti -2n
\fB/\fP \fIVi\fP-like search forward.
.ti -2n
\fB?\fP \fIVi\fP-like search backward.
.ti -2n 
\fBC-a s\fP \fIEmacs\fP style incremental search forward.
.ti -2n
\fBC-r\fP \fIEmacs\fP style reverse i-search.
.ti -4n
.IR Specials :
.br
There are however some keys that act differently than in
.IR vi .
.I Vi
does not allow one to yank rectangular blocks of text, but
.I screen
does. Press 
.br
.ti -2n
\fBc\fP or \fBC\fP to set the left or right margin respectively. If no repeat count is
given, both default to the current cursor position. 
.br
Example: Try this on a rather full text screen: 
\*QC-a [ M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE\*U.

This moves one to the middle line of the screen, moves in 20 columns left,
marks the beginning of the paste buffer, sets the left column, moves 5 columns
down, sets the right column, and then marks the end of
the paste buffer. Now try:
.br
\*QC-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE\*U

and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBJ\fP joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated by a
newline character (012), lines glued seamless, lines separated by a single
whitespace and comma separated lines. Note that you can prepend the newline
character with a carriage return character, by issuing a \*Qcrlf on\*U.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBv\fP is for all the
.I vi 
users with \*Q:set numbers\*U \- it toggles the left margin between column 9
and 1. Press 
.br
.ti -2n
\fBa\fP before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus
the contents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten, but is appended to.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBA\fP toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark.
.br
.ti -2n
\fB>\fP sets the (second) mark and writes the contents of the paste buffer to
the screen-exchange file (/tmp/screen-exchange per default) once copy-mode is 
finished. 
.br
This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer 
to that file: \*QC-A [ g SPACE G $ >\*U.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBC-g\fP gives information about the current line and column.
.br
.ti -2n
\fBx\fP exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position. You
can use this to adjust an already placed mark.
.br
.ti -2n
\fB@\fP does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode.
.br
.ti -2n
All keys not described here exit copy mode.
.in -4n

.BR "crlf " [ on | off ]
.PP
This affects the copying of text regions with the `C-a [' command. If it is set
to `on', lines will be separated by the two character sequence `CR' - `LF'. 
Otherwise (default) only `LF' is used.
When no parameter is given, the state is toggled.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "debug on" | off
.PP
Turns runtime debugging on or off. If 
.I screen
has been compiled with option -DDEBUG debugging available and is turned on per 
default. Note that this command only affects debugging output from the main 
\*QSCREEN\*U process correctly. Debug output from attacher processes can only
be turned off once and forever.
.sp

.sp
.ne 3
.B defbreaktype
.RI [ tcsendbreak | TIOCSBRK
.RI | TCSBRK ]
.PP
Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal for
terminal devices. The preferred methods are 
.IR tcsendbreak " and " TIOCSBRK .
The third, 
.IR TCSBRK , 
blocks the complete 
.I screen
session for the duration
of the break, but it may be the only way to generate long breaks. 
.IR Tcsendbreak " and " TIOCSBRK
may or may not produce long breaks with spikes (e.g. 4 per
second). This is not only system dependant, this also differs between
serial board drivers.
Calling \*Qdefbreaktype\*U with no parameter displays the current setting.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "defcharset " [ \fIset ]
.PP
Like the \fBcharset\fP command except that the default setting for
new windows is changed. Shows current default if called without
argument.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "defescape " xy
.PP
Set the default command characters. This is equivalent to the 
\*Qescape\*U except that it is useful multiuser sessions only. In a
multiuser session \*Qescape\*U changes the command character of the
calling user, where \*Qdefescape\*U changes the default command
characters for users that will be added later.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "defflow on" | off | auto 
.RB [ interrupt ]
.PP
Same as the \fBflow\fP command except that the default setting for new windows 
is changed. Initial setting is `auto'.
Specifying \*Qdefflow auto interrupt\*U is the same as the command-line options
.B \-fa
and
.BR \-i . 
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "defgr on" | off
.PP
Same as the \fBgr\fP command except that the default setting for new

.sp
.ne 3
.BR "defhstatus " [ \fIstatus ]
.PP
The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set to
.I status\fR.
This command is useful to make the hardstatus of every window
display the window number or title or the like.
.I Status
may contain the same directives as in the window messages, but
the directive escape character is '^E' (octal 005) instead of '%'.
This was done to make a misinterpretation of program generated
hardstatus lines impossible.
If the parameter
.I status
is omitted, the current default string is displayed.
Per default the hardstatus line of new windows is empty.

.ne 3
.B detach
.RB [ -h ]
.PP
Detach the 
.I screen
session (disconnect it from the terminal and put it into the background).
This returns you to the shell where you invoked
.IR screen .
A detached
.I screen
can be resumed by invoking
.I screen
with the
.B \-r
option (see also section \*QCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS\*U). The
.B \-h
option tells screen to immediately close the connection to the
terminal (\*Qhangup\*U).
.sp
.ne 3
.B dinfo
.PP
Show what screen thinks about your terminal. Useful if you want to know
why features like color or the alternate charset don't work.
.sp
.ne 3
.B displays
.PP
Shows a tabular listing of all currently connected user front-ends (displays).
This is most useful for multiuser sessions.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "digraph " [ \fIpreset ]
.PP
This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next
two characters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the
resulting character is inserted in the input stream. For example,
if the user enters 'a"', an a-umlaut will be inserted. If the
first character entered is a 0 (zero),
.I screen
will treat the following characters (up to three) as an octal
number instead.  The optional argument
.I preset
is treated as user input, thus one can create an \*Qumlaut\*U key.
For example the command "bindkey ^K digraph '"'" enables the user
to generate an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K a.
.sp
.ne 3
.B dumptermcap
.PP
Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal optimized for the currently
active window to the file \*Q.termcap\*U in the user's 
\*Q$HOME/.screen\*U directory (or wherever 
.I screen
stores its sockets. See the \*QFILES\*U section below).
This termcap entry is identical to the value of the environment variable
$TERMCAP that is set up by
.I screen
for each window. For terminfo based systems you will need to run a converter
like 
.IR captoinfo
and then compile the entry with 
.IR tic .
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "echo " [ -n ]
.I message
.PP
The echo command may be used to annoy 
.I screen
users with a 'message of the
day'. Typically installed in a global /local/etc/screenrc. 
The option \*Q-n\*U may be used to suppress the line feed.
See also \*Qsleep\*U.
Echo is also useful for online checking of environment variables.

.ne 3
.BI "encoding " enc
.RI [ enc ]
.PP
Tell 
.I screen 
how to interpret the input/output. The first argument
sets the encoding of the current window. Each window can emulate
a different encoding. The optional second parameter overwrites
the encoding of the connected terminal. It should never be
needed as screen uses the locale setting to detect the encoding.
There is also a way to select a terminal encoding depending on
the terminal type by using the \*QKJ\*U termcap entry.

Supported encodings are eucJP, SJIS, eucKR, eucCN, Big5, GBK, KOI8-R,
CP1251, UTF-8, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6,
ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.

See also \*Qdefencoding\*U, which changes the default setting of a new
window.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "escape " xy
.PP
Set the command character to \fIx\fP and the character generating a literal
command character (by triggering the \*Qmeta\*U command) to \fIy\fP (similar
to the \-e option).
Each argument is either a single character, a two-character sequence
of the form \*Q^x\*U (meaning \*QC-x\*U), a backslash followed by an octal
number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed
by a second character, such as \*Q\e^\*U or \*Q\e\e\*U.
The default is \*Q^Aa\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B eval
.I command1
.RI [ command2
.IR ... ]
.PP
Parses and executes each argument as separate command.
.sp
.ne 3
.B exec
.RI [[ fdpat ]
.IR "newcommand " [ "args ..." ]]
.PP
Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path \fInewcommand\fP and its 
optional arguments) in the current window. The flow of data between 
newcommands stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally started in the window 
(let us call it "application-process") and screen itself (window) is 
controlled by the filedescriptor pattern fdpat.
This pattern is basically a three character sequence representing stdin, stdout
and stderr of newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file descriptor
to
.IR screen .
An exclamation mark (!) causes the file
descriptor to be connected to the application-process. A colon (:) combines
both.
User input will go to newcommand unless newcommand receives the 
application-process' 
output (fdpats first character is `!' or `:') or a pipe symbol (|) is added 
(as a fourth character) to the end of fdpat.
.br
Invoking `exec' without arguments shows name and arguments of the currently
running subprocess in this window. Only one subprocess a time can be running
in each window.
.br
When a subprocess is running the `kill' command will affect it instead of the
windows process.
.br
Refer to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps' for a confusing illustration
of all 21 possible combinations. Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0
representing the three file descriptors of newcommand. The box marked
`W' is the usual pty that has the application-process on its slave side.
The box marked `P' is the secondary pty that now has
.I screen
at its master side.
.sp
Abbreviations: 
.br
Whitespace between the word `exec' and fdpat and the command 
can be omitted. Trailing dots and a fdpat consisting only of dots can be 
omitted. A simple `|' is synonymous for the pattern `!..|'; the word exec can
be omitted here and can always be replaced by `!'.
.sp
Examples:
.IP
exec ... /bin/sh
.br
exec /bin/sh
.br
!/bin/sh
.PP
Creates another shell in the same window, while the original shell is still 
running. Output of both shells is displayed and user input is sent to the new
/bin/sh.
.IP
exec !.. stty 19200
.br
exec ! stty 19200
.br
!!stty 19200
.PP
Set the speed of the window's tty. If your stty command operates on stdout, 
then add another `!'.
.IP
exec !..| less
.br
|less
.PP
This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|' is needed to
give the user control over the pager although it gets its input from the 
window's process. This works, because
.I less
listens on stderr (a behavior that
.I screen
would not expect without the `|') 
when its stdin is not a tty. 
.I Less 
versions newer than 177 fail miserably here; good old
.I pg
still works.
.IP
!:sed -n s/.*Error.*/\e007/p
.PP
Sends window output to both, the user and the sed command. The sed inserts an
additional bell character (oct. 007) to the window output seen by
.IR screen .
This will cause "Bell in window x" messages, whenever the string "Error"
appears in the window.
.sp
.ne 3
.B fit
.PP
Change the window size to the size of the current region. This
command is needed because screen doesn't adapt the window size
automatically if the window is displayed more than once.
.sp
.ne 3
.B flow
.RB [ on | off | "auto\fR]\fP"
.PP
Sets the flow-control mode for this window.
Without parameters it cycles the current window's flow-control setting from 
"automatic" to "on" to "off".
See the discussion on \*QFLOW-CONTROL\*U later on in this document for full 
details and note, that this is subject to change in future releases.
Default is set by `defflow'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "focus " [ up | down | top | bottom ]
.PP
Move the input focus to the next region. This is done in a cyclic
way so that the top region is selected after the bottom one. If
no subcommand is given it defaults to `down'. `up' cycles in the
opposite order, `top' and `bottom' go to the top and bottom
region respectively. Useful bindings are (j and k as in vi)
.nf
    bind j focus down
    bind k focus up
    bind t focus top
    bind b focus bottom
.fi
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "gr " [ on | off ]
.PP
Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input
character with the 8th bit set, it will use the charset stored in the
GR slot and print the character with the 8th bit stripped. The
default (see also \*Qdefgr\*U) is not to process GR switching because
otherwise the ISO88591 charset would not work.
.sp
.ne 3
.B hardcopy
.RB [ -h ]
.RI [ file ]
.PP
Writes out the currently displayed image to the file \fIfile\fP,
or, if no filename is specified, to \fIhardcopy.n\fP in the
default directory, where \fIn\fP is the number of the current window. 
This either appends or overwrites the file if it exists. See below.
If the option \fB-h\fP is specified, dump also the contents of the
scrollback buffer.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "hardcopy_append on" | off
.PP
If set to "on", 
.I screen
will append to the "hardcopy.n" files created by the command \*QC-a h\*U, 
otherwise these files are overwritten each time.
Default is `off'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "hardcopydir "directory
.PP
Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If unset, hardcopys
are dumped in
.IR screen 's
current working directory.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "hardstatus " [ on | off ]
.br
.BR "hardstatus \fR[\fBalways\fR]\fBlastline" | message | ignore
.RI [ string ]
.br
.B "hardstatus string"
.RI [ string ]
.PP
This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal's
hardstatus line. The first form
toggles whether
.I screen
will use the hardware status line to display messages. If the
flag is set to `off', these messages
are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The default
setting is `on'.
.P
The second form tells 
.I screen 
what to do if the terminal doesn't
have a hardstatus line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities
"hs", "ts", "fs" and "ds" are not set). If the type
\*Qlastline\*U is used, 
.I screen 
will reserve the last line of the
display for
the hardstatus. \*Qmessage\*U uses 
.I screen's
message mechanism and
\*Qignore\*U tells 
.I screen 
never to display the hardstatus.
If you prepend the word \*Qalways\*U to the type (e.g., \*Qalwayslastline\*U), 
.I screen 
will use the type even if the terminal supports a hardstatus.
.P
The third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus line.  '%h' is
used as default string, i.e. the stored hardstatus of the current
window (settable via \*QESC]0;<string>^G\*U or \*QESC_<string>ESC\e\*U)
is displayed.  You can customize this to any string you like including
the escapes from the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U chapter. If you leave out
the argument
.IR string ,
the current string is displayed.
.P
You can mix the second and third form by providing the string as
additional argument.
.sp
.ne 3
.B height
.RB [ -w | -d ]
.RI [ lines " [" cols ]]
.PP
Set the display height to a specified number of lines. When no argument
is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines display. You can also
specify a width if you want to change both values.
The
.B -w
option tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set
the window size,
.B -d
vice versa.
.sp
.ne 3
.B help
.RB [ -c
.IR class ]
.PP
Not really a online help, but 
displays a help 
.I screen 
showing you all the key bindings.
The first pages list all the internal commands followed by their current
bindings.
Subsequent pages will display the custom commands, one command per key.
Press space when you're done reading each page, or return to exit early.
All other characters are ignored. If the \*Q-c\*U option is given,
display all bound commands for the specified command class.
See also \*QDEFAULT KEY BINDINGS\*U section.
.sp
.ne 3
.B history
.PP
Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access to previous commands.
For example csh has the command \*Q!!\*U to repeat the last command executed. 
.I Screen
allows you to have a primitive way of re-calling \*Qthe command that
started ...\*U: You just type the first letter of that command, then hit
`C-a {' and
.I screen
tries to find a previous line that matches with the `prompt character' 
to the left of the cursor. This line is pasted into this window's input queue.
Thus you have a crude command history (made up by the visible window and its
scrollback buffer). 
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "hstatus " status
.PP
Change the window's hardstatus line to the string \fIstatus\fP.
.sp
.ne 3
.B idle
.RI [ timeout
.RI [ "cmd args" ]]
.PP
Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds
inactivity is reached. This command will normally be the \*Qblanker\*U
command to create a screen blanker, but it can be any screen command.
If no command is specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of
zero (ot the special timeout \fBoff\fP) disables the timer.
If no arguments are given, the current settings are displayed.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "ignorecase " [ on | off ]
.PP
Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in searches. Default is
`off'.
.sp
.ne 3
.B info
.PP
Uses the message line to display some information about the current window:
the cursor position in the form \*Q(column,row)\*U starting with \*Q(1,1)\*U,
the terminal width and height plus the size of the scrollback buffer in lines, 
like in \*Q(80,24)+50\*U, the current state of window XON/XOFF flow control
is shown like this (See also section FLOW CONTROL):

.nf
  +flow     automatic flow control, currently on.
  -flow     automatic flow control, currently off.
  +(+)flow  flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic control.
  -(+)flow  flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
  +(-)flow  flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
  -(-)flow  flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic control.
.fi

The current line wrap setting (`+wrap' indicates enabled, `\-wrap' not) is
also shown. The flags `ins', `org', `app', `log', `mon' or `nored' are 
displayed when the window is in insert mode, origin mode, 
application-keypad mode, has output logging,
activity monitoring or partial redraw enabled.

The currently active character set (\fIG0\fP, \fIG1\fP, \fIG2\fP,
or \fIG3\fP) and in square brackets the terminal character sets that are
currently designated as \fIG0\fP through \fIG3\fP is shown. If the window
is in UTF-8 mode, the string \*QUTF-8\*U is shown instead.

Additional modes depending on the type of the window are displayed at the end of the status line (See also chapter \*QWINDOW TYPES\*U).
.br
If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default state,
the info line is started with a string identifying the current state.
.br
For system information use the \*Qtime\*U command.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR ins_reg " [" \fIkey ]
.PP
No longer exists, use \*Qpaste\*U instead.
.sp
.ne 3
.B kill
.PP
Kill current window.
.br 
If there is an `exec' command running then it is killed. Otherwise the process
(shell) running in the window receives a HANGUP condition, 
the window structure is removed and 
.I screen 
(your display) switches to another
window.  When the last window is destroyed, 
.I screen
exits.
After a kill 
.I screen 
switches to the previously displayed window.
.br
Note:
.I Emacs
users should keep this command in mind, when killing a line.
It is recommended not to use \*QC-a\*U as the
.I screen
escape key or to rebind kill to \*QC-a K\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B lastmsg
.PP
Redisplay the last contents of the message/status line.
Useful if you're typing when a message appears, because  the message goes 
away when you press a key (unless your terminal has a hardware status line).
Refer to the commands \*Qmsgwait\*U and \*Qmsgminwait\*U for fine tuning.
.sp
.ne 3
.B license
.PP
Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever
.I screen
is started without options, which should be often enough. See also 
the \*Qstartup_message\*U command.
.sp
.ne 3
.B lockscreen
.PP
Lock this display.
Call a screenlock program (/local/bin/lck or /usr/bin/lock or a builtin if no
other is available). Screen does not accept any command keys until this program
terminates. Meanwhile processes in the windows may continue, as the windows 
are in the `detached' state. The screenlock program may be changed through the
environment variable $LOCKPRG (which must be set in the shell from which 
.I screen
is started) and is executed with the user's uid and gid.
.br
Warning: 
When you leave other shells unlocked and you have no password set on           
.IR screen ,
the lock is void: One could easily re-attach from an unlocked
shell. This feature should rather be called `lockterminal'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "log " [ on | off ]
.PP
Start/stop writing output of the current window to a file 
\*Qscreenlog.\fIn\fP\*U in the window's default directory, where \fIn\fP 
is the number of the current window. This filename can be changed with
the `logfile' command. If no parameter is given, the state
of logging is toggled. The session log is appended to the previous contents 
of the file if it already exists. The current contents and the contents 
of the scrollback history are not included in the session log.
Default is `off'.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "logfile " filename
.br
.BI "logfile flush " secs
.PP
Defines the name the logfiles will get. The default is
\*Qscreenlog.%n\*U. The second form changes the number of seconds
.I screen
will wait before flushing the logfile buffer to the file-system. The
default value is 10 seconds.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "login " [ on | off ]
.PP
Adds or removes the entry in the utmp database file for the current window.
This controls if the window is `logged in'.
When no parameter is given, the login state of the window is toggled.
Additionally to that toggle, it is convenient having a `log in' and a `log out'
key. E.\|g. `bind I login on' and `bind O login off' will map these
keys to be C-a I and C-a O.
The default setting (in config.h.in) should be \*Qon\*U for a 
.I screen
that runs under suid-root.
Use the \*Qdeflogin\*U command to change the default login state for new 
windows. Both commands are only present when 
.I screen
has been compiled with utmp support.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "logtstamp " [ on | off ]
.br
.B "logtstamp after"
.RI [ secs ]
.br
.B "logtstamp string"
.RI [ string ]
.PP
This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of 
.I screen.
If
time-stamps are turned \*Qon\*U, 
.I screen 
adds a string containing
the current time to the logfile after two minutes of inactivity.
When output continues and more than another two minutes have passed,
a second time-stamp is added to document the restart of the
output. You can change this timeout with the second form
of the command. The third form is used for customizing the time-stamp
string (`-- %n:%t -- time-stamp -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\\n' by
default).
.sp
.ne 3
.B mapdefault
.PP
Tell 
.I screen 
that the next input character should only be looked up
in the default bindkey table. See also \*Qbindkey\*U.
.sp

.B mapnotnext
.PP
Like mapdefault, but don't even look in the default bindkey table.
.sp
.ne 3
.B maptimeout
.RI [ timo ]
.PP
Set the inter-character timer for input sequence detection to a timeout
of
.I timo
ms. The default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments shows
the current setting.
See also \*Qbindkey\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "markkeys " string
.PP
This is a method of changing the keymap used for copy/history mode.
The string is made up of \fIoldchar\fP=\fInewchar\fP pairs which are
separated by `:'. Example: The string \*QB=^B:F=^F\*U will change the 
keys `C-b' and `C-f' to the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page).
This happens to be the default binding for `B' and `F'.
The command \*Qmarkkeys h=^B:l=^F:$=^E\*U would set the mode for an emacs-style
binding.
If your terminal sends characters, that cause you to abort copy mode,
then this command may help by binding these characters to do nothing.
The no-op character is `@' and is used like this: \*Qmarkkeys
@=L=H\*U if you do not want to use the `H' or `L' commands any longer.
As shown in this example, multiple keys can be assigned to one function in a 
single statement.
.sp

.BI "maxwin " num
.PP
Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesn't affect
already existing windows. The number may only be decreased.

Insert the command character (C-a) in the current window's input stream.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "monitor " [ on | off ]
.PP
Toggles activity monitoring of windows.
When monitoring is turned on and an affected window is switched into the
background, you will receive the activity notification message in the
status line at the first sign of output and the window will also be marked
with an `@' in the window-status display.
Monitoring is initially off for all windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "msgminwait " sec
.PP
Defines the time 
.I screen 
delays a new message when one message is currently displayed. 
The default is 1 second.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "msgwait " sec
.PP
Defines the time a message is displayed if 
.I screen
is not disturbed by other activity. The default is 5 seconds.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "multiuser on" | off
.PP
Switch between singleuser and multiuser mode. Standard
.I screen
operation is singleuser. In multiuser mode the commands `acladd',
`aclchg', `aclgrp' and `acldel'
can be used to enable (and disable) other users accessing this 
.I screen
session. 
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "nethack on" | off
.PP
Changes the kind of error messages used by
.IR screen .
When you are familiar with the game \*Qnethack\*U, you may enjoy the
nethack-style messages which will often blur the facts a little, but are
much funnier to read. Anyway, standard messages often tend to be unclear as
well.
.br
This option is only 
available if
.I screen
was compiled with the NETHACK flag defined. The
default setting is then determined by the presence of the environment 
variable $NETHACKOPTIONS.
.sp
.ne 3
.B next
.PP
Switch to the next window.
This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.B nonblock 
.RB [ on | off | \fInumsecs ]
.PP
Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays) that cease to
accept output. This can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem
connection gets cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is
\fBoff\fP (this is the default) screen waits until the display
restarts to accept the output. If nonblock is \fBon\fP, screen
waits until the timeout is reached (\fBon\fP is treated as 1s). If the
display still doesn't receive characters, screen will consider
it \*Qblocked\*U and stop sending characters to it. If at
some time it restarts to accept characters, screen will unblock
the display and redisplay the updated window contents.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "number " [ \fIn ]
.PP
Change the current windows number. If the given number \fIn\fP is already 
used by another window, both windows exchange their numbers. If no argument is
specified, the current window number (and title) is shown.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "obuflimit " [ \fIlimit ]
.PP
If the output buffer contains more bytes than the specified limit, no
more data will be
read from the windows. The default value is 256. If you have a fast
display (like xterm), you can set it to some higher value. If no
argument is specified, the current setting is displayed.
.sp
.ne 3
.B only
.PP
Kill all regions but the current one.
.sp
.ne 3
.B other
.PP
Switch to the window displayed previously. If this window does no longer exist,
\fIother\fP has the same effect as \fInext\fP.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "partial on" | off
.PP
Defines whether the display should be refreshed (as with \fIredisplay\fP) after
switching to the current window. This command only affects the current window.
To immediately affect all windows use the \fIallpartial\fP command.
Default is `off', of course.  This default is fixed, as there is currently no 
\fIdefpartial\fP command.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "password " [ \fIcrypted_pw ]
.PP
Present a crypted password in your \*Q.screenrc\*U file and
.I screen
will ask
for it, whenever someone attempts to resume a detached. This is useful
if you have privileged programs running under
.I screen
and you want to protect your session from reattach attempts by another user
masquerading as your uid (i.e. any superuser.)
If no crypted password is specified,
.I screen
prompts twice for typing a
password and places its encryption in the paste buffer.
Default is `none', this disables password checking.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR paste
.RI [ registers " [" dest_reg ]]
.PP
Write the (concatenated) contents of the specified registers to the stdin queue
of the current window. The register '.' is treated as the
paste buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a single 
register to paste.
The paste buffer can be filled with the \fIcopy\fP, \fIhistory\fP and 
\fIreadbuf\fP commands. 
Other registers can be filled with the \fIregister\fP, \fIreadreg\fP and 
\fIpaste\fP commands.
If \fIpaste\fP is called with a second argument, the contents of the specified
registers is pasted into the named destination register rather than 
the window. If '.' is used as the second argument, the displays paste buffer is
the destination.
Note, that \*Qpaste\*U uses a wide variety of resources: Whenever a second 
argument is specified no current window is needed. When the source specification
only contains registers (not the paste buffer) then there need not be a current 
display (terminal attached), as the registers are a global resource. The 
paste buffer exists once for every user.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "pastefont " [ on | off ]
.PP
Tell 
.I screen 
to include font information in the paste buffer. The
default is not to do so. This command is especially useful for
multi character fonts like kanji.
.sp
.ne 3
.B pow_break
.PP
Reopen the window's terminal line and send a break condition. See `break'.
.sp
.ne 3
.B pow_detach
.PP
Power detach. 
Mainly the same as \fIdetach\fP, but also sends a HANGUP signal to
the parent process of
.IR screen .
CAUTION: This will result in a logout, when 
.I screen
was started from your login shell.
.sp
.ne 3
.B pow_detach_msg
.RI [ message ]
.PP
The \fImessage\fP specified here is output whenever a `Power detach' was
performed. It may be used as a replacement for a logout message or to reset 
baud rate, etc. 
Without parameter, the current message is shown.
.sp
.ne 3
.B prev
.PP
Switch to the window with the next lower number.
This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.B printcmd
.RI [ cmd ]
.PP
If
.I cmd
is not an empty string, 
.I screen 
will not use the terminal capabilities
\*Qpo/pf\*U if it detects an ansi print sequence
.BR "ESC [ 5 i" ,
but pipe the output into
.IR cmd .
This should normally be a command like \*Qlpr\*U or
\*Q'cat > /tmp/scrprint'\*U.
.B printcmd
without a command displays the current setting.
The ansi sequence
.B "ESC \e"
ends printing and closes the pipe.
.br
Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have write
access to your terminal, they will be able to fire off print commands.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR process " [" \fIkey ]
.PP
Stuff the contents of the specified register into 
.IR screen 's
input queue. If no argument is given you are prompted for a
register name. The text is parsed as if it had been typed in from the user's
keyboard. This command can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.
.sp
.ne 3
.B quit
.PP
Kill all windows and terminate
.IR screen .
Note that on VT100-style terminals the keys C-4 and C-\e are identical.
This makes the default bindings dangerous:
Be careful not to type C-a C-4 when selecting window no. 4.
Use the empty bind command (as in \*Qbind '^\e'\*U) to remove a key binding.
.sp
.ne 3
.B readbuf

.PP
Reads the contents of the specified file into the paste buffer.
You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the \fB-e\fP option.
If no file is specified, the screen-exchange filename is used.
See also \*Qbufferfile\*U command.
.sp

.B readreg 
.RB [ -e
.IR encoding ]
.RI [ register " [" filename ]]
.PP
Does one of two things, dependent on number of arguments: with zero or one
arguments it it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the register specified
or entered at the prompt. With two arguments it reads the contents of the named 
file into the register, just as \fIreadbuf\fP reads the screen-exchange file
into the paste buffer.
You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the \fB-e\fP option.
The following example will paste the system's password file into 
the 
.I screen 
window (using register p, where a copy remains):
.PP
.nf
	C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd
	C-a : paste p

Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full redisplay when in
partial redraw mode.
.sp
.ne 3
.B register
.RB [ -e

.I "key string"
.PP
Save the specified \fIstring\fP to the register \fIkey\fP.
The encoding of the string can be specified via the \fB-e\fP option.
See also the \*Qpaste\*U command.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "remove"
.PP
Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is only one region.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "removebuf"
.PP
Unlinks the screen-exchange file used by the commands \*Qwritebuf\*U and 
\*Qreadbuf\*U. 
.sp
.ne 3
.B "reset"
.PP 
Reset the virtual terminal to its \*Qpower-on\*U values. Useful when strange
settings (like scroll regions or graphics character set) are left over from
an application.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "resize"
.PP 
Resize the current region. The space will be removed from or added to
the region below or if there's not enough space from the region above.
.IP
resize +N	increase current region height by N
.IP
resize -N	decrease current region height by N
.IP

.ne 3
.B "screen \fP[\fI-opts\fP] [\fIn\fP] [\fIcmd\fP [\fIargs\fP]]"
.PP
Establish a new window.
The flow-control options (\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-fn\fP and \fB\-fa\fP),
title (a.\|k.\|a.) option (\fB\-t\fP), login options (\fB-l\fP and \fB-ln\fP)
, terminal type option (\fB-T\fP <term>), the all-capability-flag (\fB-a\fP)
and scrollback option (\fB-h\fP <num>) may be specified with each command. 
The option (\fB-M\fP) turns monitoring on for this window.
The option (\fB-L\fP) turns output logging on for this window.
If an optional number \fIn\fP in the range 0..9 is given, the window
number \fIn\fP is assigned to the newly created window (or, if this
number is already in-use, the next available number).
If a command is specified after \*Qscreen\*U, this command (with the given
arguments) is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created.
Thus, if your \*Q.screenrc\*U contains the lines
.sp
.nf
	# example for .screenrc:
	screen 1
	screen -fn -t foobar -L 2 telnet foobar
.fi
.sp
.I screen
creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window with a TELNET connection
to the machine foobar (with no flow-control using the title \*Qfoobar\*U
in window #2) and will write a logfile (\*Qscreenlog.2\*U) of the telnet 
session.
Note, that unlike previous versions of
.I screen
no additional default window is created when \*Qscreen\*U commands are 
included in your \*Q.screenrc\*U file. When the initialization is completed,
.I screen
switches to the last window specified in your .screenrc file or, if none,
opens a default window #0.
.br
Screen has built in some functionality of \*Qcu\*U and \*Qtelnet\*U.
See also chapter \*QWINDOW TYPES\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "scrollback \fP\fInum\fP"
.PP
Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current windows to \fInum\fP 
lines. The default scrollback is 100 lines.
See also the \*Qdefscrollback\*U command and use \*QC-a i\*U to view the 
current setting.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "select " [ \fIWindowID ]
.PP
Switch to the window identified by \fIWindowID\fP.
This can be a prefix of a window title (alphanumeric window name) or a
window number.
The parameter is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an identifier. 
When a new window is established, the first available number
is assigned to this window.
Thus, the first window can be activated by \*Qselect 0\*U.
The number of windows is limited at compile-time by the MAXWIN
configuration parameter.
There are two special WindowIDs, \*Q-\*U selects the
internal blank window and \*Q.\*U selects the current window. The
latter is useful if used with screen's \*Q-X\*U option.
.sp
.ne
.BR "sessionname " [ \fIname ]
.PP
Rename the current session. Note, that for \*Qscreen -list\*U the
name shows up with the process-id prepended. If the argument \*Qname\*U
is omitted, the name of this session is displayed. Caution: The $STY 
environment variables still reflects the old name. This may result in 
confusion. 
The default is constructed from the tty and host names.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "setenv " 
.RI [ var " [" string ]]
.PP
Set the environment variable \fIvar\fP to value \fIstring\fP.
If only \fIvar\fP is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value.
If no parameters are specified, the user will be prompted for both variable
and value. The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "setsid " [ on | off ]
.PP
Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for
the windows. If setsid is turned \fIoff\fP, this is not done
anymore and all windows will be in the same process group as the
screen backend process. This also breaks job-control, so be careful.
The default is \fIon\fP, of course. This command is probably useful
only in rare circumstances.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "shell \fIcommand\fP"
.PP
Set the command to be used to create a new shell.
This overrides the value of the environment variable $SHELL.
This is useful if you'd like to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to
execute the program specified in $SHELL. If the command begins with
a '-' character, the shell will be started as a login-shell.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "shelltitle \fItitle\fP"
.PP
Set the title for all shells created during startup or by
the C-A C-c command.
For details about what a title is, see the discussion
entitled \*QTITLES (naming windows)\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "silence " [ on | off "|\fIsec\fP]"
.PP
Toggles silence monitoring of windows.
When silence is turned on and an affected window is switched into the
background, you will receive the silence notification message in the
status line after a specified period of inactivity (silence). The default
timeout can be changed with the `silencewait' command or by specifying a 
number of seconds instead of `on' or `off'.
Silence is initially off for all windows.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "silencewait " sec
.PP
Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait before
displaying a message. Default 30 seconds.
.sp
.ne
.B "sleep \fP\fInum\fP"
.PP
This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for \fInum\fP seconds.
Keyboard activity will end the sleep.
It may be used to give users a chance to read the messages output by \*Qecho\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "slowpaste \fImsec\fP"
.PP
Define the speed at which text is inserted into the current window by the 
paste ("C-a ]") command. 
If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is written character by character.
.I screen
will make a pause of \fImsec\fP milliseconds after each single character write 
to allow the application to process its input. Only use slowpaste if your 
underlying system exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of 
text. 
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "source " file
.PP
Read and execute commands from file \fIfile\fP. Source commands may
be nested to a maximum recursion level of ten. If file is not an
absolute path and screen is already processing a source command, the
parent directory of the running source command file is used to search
for the new command file before screen's current directory.

Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at
startup and reattach time, so they must be reached via the
default screenrc files to have an effect.
.sp
.ne 3
.B sorendition
.RB [ "\fIattr\fR " [ \fIcolor ]]
.PP
Change the way 
.I screen 
does highlighting for text marking and printing messages.
See the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U chapter for the syntax of the modifiers.
The default is currently \*Q=s dd\*U (standout, default colors).
.sp
.ne 3
.B split
.PP
Split the current region into two new ones. All regions on the
display are resized to make room for the new region. The blank
window is displayed on the new region. Use the \*Qremove\*U or the
\*Qonly\*U command to delete regions.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "startup_message on\fP|\fBoff"
.PP
Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup.
Default is `on', as you probably noticed.
.sp
.ne 3
.B stuff
.I string
.PP
Stuff the string
.I string
in the input buffer of the current window.
This is like the \*Qpaste\*U command but with much less overhead.
You cannot paste
large buffers with the \*Qstuff\*U command. It is most useful for key
bindings. See also \*Qbindkey\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B su
.RB [ username " [" password
.RB [ password2 ]]
.PP
Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts for all parameters that
are omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters, they have to be
specified un-crypted. The first password is matched against the systems
passwd database, the second password is matched against the 
.I screen
password as set with the commands \*Qacladd\*U or \*Qpassword\*U.
\*QSu\*U may be useful for the 
.I screen
administrator to test multiuser setups.
.\"						XXX removed in 3.8.0 XXX
.\" but it is mainly used implicitly
.\" by the \*Qconnect\*U command to identify users that access a remote session.
When the identification fails, the user has access to the commands available
for user
.BR nobody .
These are \*Qdetach\*U, \*Qlicense\*U, \*Qversion\*U, \*Qhelp\*U and
\*Qdisplays\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "suspend"
.PP
Suspend
.IR screen .
The windows are in the `detached' state, while 
.I screen
is suspended. This feature relies on the shell being able to do job control.
.sp
.ne 3
.B "term \fIterm\fP"
.PP
In each window's environment
.I screen
opens, the $TERM variable is set to \*Qscreen\*U by default. 
But when no description for \*Qscreen\*U is installed in the local termcap
or terminfo data base, you set $TERM to \- say \-
\*Qvt100\*U. This won't do much harm, as 
.I screen
is VT100/ANSI compatible.
The use of the \*Qterm\*U command is discouraged for non-default purpose.
That is, one may want to specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100) for the
next \*Qscreen rlogin othermachine\*U command. Use the command \*Qscreen -T vt100
rlogin othermachine\*U rather than setting and resetting the default.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI termcap " term terminal-tweaks"
.RI [ window-tweaks ]
.br
.BI terminfo " term terminal-tweaks"
.RI [ window-tweaks ]
.br
.BI termcapinfo " term terminal-tweaks"
.RI [ window-tweaks ]
.PP
Use this command to modify your terminal's termcap entry without going
through all the hassles involved in creating a custom termcap entry.
Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the windows.
You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as
they are meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted.  
.br
If your system works uses the terminfo database rather than termcap, 
.I screen 
will understand the `terminfo' command, which has the same effects as the
`termcap' command.  Two separate commands are provided, as there are subtle
syntactic differences, e.g. when parameter interpolation (using `%') is
required. Note that termcap names of the capabilities have to be used
with the `terminfo' command. 
.br
In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and termcap
syntax, you can use the command `termcapinfo', which is just a shorthand
for a pair of `termcap' and `terminfo' commands with identical arguments.
.PP
The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be affected by this
definition.
You can specify multiple terminal names by separating them with `|'s.
Use `*' to match all terminals and `vt*' to match all terminals that begin
with \*Qvt\*U.
.PP
Each \fItweak\fP argument contains one or more termcap defines (separated
by `:'s) to be inserted at the start of the appropriate termcap entry,
enhancing it or overriding existing values.
The first tweak modifies your terminal's termcap, and contains definitions
that your terminal uses to perform certain functions.
Specify a null string to leave this unchanged (e.\|g. '').
The second (optional) tweak modifies all the window termcaps, and should
contain definitions that
.I screen
understands (see the \*QVIRTUAL TERMINAL\*U
section).
.PP
Some examples:
.IP
termcap xterm*  LP:hs@
.PP
Informs
.I screen
that all terminals that begin with `xterm' have firm auto-margins that
allow the last position on the screen to be updated (LP), but they don't
really have a status line (no 'hs' \- append `@' to turn entries off).
Note that we assume `LP' for all terminal names that start with \*Qvt\*U,
but only if you don't specify a termcap command for that terminal.
.IP
termcap vt*  LP
.br
termcap vt102|vt220  Z0=\eE[?3h:Z1=\eE[?3l
.PP
Specifies the firm-margined `LP' capability for all terminals that begin with
`vt', and the second line will also add the escape-sequences to switch
into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this is
a VT102 or VT220.
(You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap to use the width-changing
commands.)
.IP
termcap vt100  ""  l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4
.PP
This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key labels to
each window's termcap entry.
.IP
termcap h19|z19  am@:im=\eE@:ei=\eEO  dc=\eE[P
.PP
Takes a h19 or z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables the
insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities (the `@' in the `im'
string is after the `=', so it is part of the string).
Having the `im' and `ei' definitions put into your terminal's termcap will
cause
.I screen
to automatically advertise the character-insert capability in
each window's termcap.
Each window will also get the delete-character capability (dc) added to its
termcap, which
.I screen
will translate into a line-update for the terminal
(we're pretending it doesn't support character deletion).
.PP
If you would like to fully specify each window's termcap entry, you should
instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running
.IR screen .
See the discussion on the \*QVIRTUAL TERMINAL\*U in this manual, and the termcap(5)
man page for more information on termcap definitions.
.sp
.ne 3
.B time
.RI [ string ]
.PP
Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name, and the load
averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is available on your system).
For window specific information use \*Qinfo\*U.

If a string is specified, it changes the format of the time report like it is
described in the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U chapter. Screen uses a default of
"%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?".
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "title " [ \fIwindowtitle ]
.PP
Set the name of the current window to \fIwindowtitle\fP. If no name is 
specified,
.I screen
prompts for one. This command was known as `aka' in previous
releases.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "unsetenv " var
.PP
Unset an environment variable.
.sp
.ne 3
.B utf8
.RB [ on | off
.RB [ on | off ]]
.PP
Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is enabled, the
strings sent to the window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice versa. Omitting the
parameter toggles the setting. If a second parameter is given, the display's
encoding is also changed (this should rather be done with screen's \*Q-U\*U
option).
See also \*Qdefutf8\*U, which changes the default setting of a new
window.
.sp
.ne 3
.B vbell 
.RB [ on | off ]
.PP
Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting the parameter
toggles the setting. If vbell is switched on, but your terminal does not 
support a visual bell, a `vbell-message' is displayed in the status line when
the bell character (^G) is received.
Visual bell support of a terminal is defined by the termcap variable `vb' 
(terminfo: 'flash'). 
.br
Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used. 
See also `bell_msg'.
.sp
.ne 3
.B vbell_msg
.RI [ message ]
.PP
Sets the visual bell message. \fImessage\fP is printed to the status line if
the window receives a bell character (^G), vbell is set to \*Qon\*U, but the 
terminal does not support a visual bell.
The default message is \*QWuff, Wuff!!\*U.
Without parameter, the current message is shown.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI "vbellwait " sec
.PP
Define a delay in seconds after each display of 
.IR screen 's
visual bell message. The default is 1 second.
.sp
.ne 3
.B verbose
.RB [ on | off ]
.PP
If verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a window
is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is off.
Without parameter, the current setting is shown.
.sp
.ne 3
.B version
.PP
Print the current version and the compile date in the status line.
.sp
.ne 3

.B width
.RB [ -w | -d ]
.RI [ cols " [" lines ]]
.PP
Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to \fIcols\fP 
columns if an argument is specified. 
This requires a capable terminal and the termcap entries \*QZ0\*U and \*QZ1\*U.
See the \*Qtermcap\*U command for more information. You can also specify
a new height if you want to change both values.
The
.B -w
option tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set
the window size,
.B -d
vice versa.
.sp
.ne 3

.RB [ -b ]
.RB [ -m ]
.br
.B windowlist
.B string

.B title
.RI [ title ]
.PP
Display all windows in a table for visual window selection. The
desired window can be selected via the standard movement keys (see
the \*Qcopy\*U command) and activated via the return key.
If the 
.B -b
option is given, screen will switch to the blank window before
presenting the list, so that the current window is also selectable.
The
.B -m
option changes the order of the windows, instead of sorting by
window numbers screen uses its internal most-recently-used list.

The table format can be changed with the \fBstring\fP and
\fBtitle\fP option, the title is displayed as table heading, while
the lines are made by using the string setting. The default
setting is \*QNum Name%=Flags\*U for the title and \*Q%3n %t%=%f\*U
for the lines.
See the \*QSTRING ESCAPES\*U chapter for more codes (e.g. color
settings).
.sp
.ne 3
.B windows
.PP
Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows.
Each window is listed by number with the name of process that has been
started in the window (or its title);
the current window is marked with a `*';
the previous window is marked with a `-';
all the windows that are \*Qlogged in\*U are marked with a `$';
a background window that has received a bell is marked with a `!';
a background window that is being monitored and has had activity occur
is marked with an `@';
a window which has output logging turned on is marked with `(L)'; 
windows occupied by other users are marked with `&';
windows in the zombie state are marked with `Z'.
If this list is too long to fit on the terminal's status line only the
portion around the current window is displayed.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "wrap " [ on | off ]
.PP
Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window.
When line-wrap is on, the second consecutive printable character output at
the last column of a line will wrap to the start of the following line.
As an added feature, backspace (^H) will also wrap through the left margin
to the previous line.
Default is `on'.
.sp
.ne 3
.B writebuf
.RB [ -e
.IR encoding ]
.RI [ filename ]
.PP
Writes the contents of the paste buffer to the specified file, or the public accessible screen-exchange
file if no filename is given. This is thought of as a primitive means of communication between
.I screen
users on the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer
is recoded on the fly to match the encoding.
The filename can be set with the \fIbufferfile\fP
command and defaults to \*Q/tmp/screen-exchange\*U.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "writelock " [ on | "off\fR|\fBauto\fR]"
.PP
In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able to write to
the same window at once. Per default, writelock is in `auto' mode and
grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to switch
to the particular window. When he leaves the window, other users may obtain
the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current window is disabled
by the command \*Qwritelock off\*U. If the user issues the command 
\*Qwritelock on\*U he keeps the exclusive write permission while switching
to other windows.

.br
.B "zmodem recvcmd"
.RI [ string ]
.PP
Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two different
modes when it detects a zmodem request: \*Qpass\*U and \*Qcatch\*U.
If the mode is set to \*Qpass\*U, screen will relay all data
to the attacher until the end of the transmission is reached.
In \*Qcatch\*U mode screen acts as a zmodem endpoint and starts
the corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is set to \*Qauto\*U,
screen will use \*Qcatch\*U if the window is a tty (e.g. a serial line),
otherwise it will use \*Qpass\*U.
.br
You can define the templates screen uses in \*Qcatch\*U mode
via the second and the third form.
.br
Note also that this is an experimental feature.
.sp
.ne 3
.BR "zombie " [\fIkeys\fP]
.br
.BR "defzombie " [\fIkeys\fP]
.PP
Per default
.I screen 
windows are removed from the window list as soon as
the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys is 
specified to the zombie command, `dead' windows will remain in the list.
The \fBkill\fP command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the 
first key in the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the second 
key, 
.I screen 
will attempt to resurrect the window. The process that was 
initially running in the window will be launched again. Calling \fBzombie\fP
without parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus making windows disappear 
when their process exits.

As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows, this command 
should only be called \fBdefzombie\fP. Until we need this as a per window 
setting, the commands \fBzombie\fP and \fBdefzombie\fP are synonymous.

.SH "THE MESSAGE LINE"
.I Screen
displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a \fImessage line\fP.
While this line is distributed to appear at the bottom of the screen,
it can be defined to appear at the top of the screen during compilation.
If your terminal has a status line defined in its termcap,
.I screen
will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a line of the
current screen will
be temporarily overwritten and output will be momentarily interrupted. The
message line is automatically removed after a few seconds delay, but it
can also be removed early (on terminals without a status line) by beginning
to type.
.PP
The message line facility can be used by an application running in
the current window by means of the ANSI \fIPrivacy message\fP
control sequence.
For instance, from within the shell, try something like:
.IP
echo '<esc>^Hello world from window '$WINDOW'<esc>\e\e'
.PP
where '<esc>' is an \fIescape\fP, '^' is a literal up-arrow,
and '\e\e' turns into a single backslash.

.SH "WINDOW TYPES"
Screen provides three different window types. New windows are created with 
.IR screen 's
.B screen
command (see also the entry in chapter \*QCUSTOMIZATION\*U). The first
parameter to the 
.B screen
command defines which type of window is created. The different window types are
all special cases of the normal type. They have been added in order
to allow 
.I screen 
to be used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more windows.

.IP \(bu 3
The normal window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is given) or any
other system command that could be executed from a shell (e.g.  
.BR slogin ,
etc...) 

.IP \(bu
If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. \*Q/dev/ttya\*U)
is specified as the first parameter, then the window is directly connected to
this device. 
This window type is similar to \*Qscreen cu -l /dev/ttya\*U.
Read and write access is required on the device node, an exclusive open is
attempted on the node to mark the connection line as busy.
An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated list of flags
in the notation used by stty(1):
.RS
.IP <baud_rate>		
Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission as well as receive speed.
.IP "cs8 or cs7"
Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.
.IP "ixon or -ixon"
Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for sending data.
.IP "ixoff or -ixon"
Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving data.
.IP "istrip or -istrip"
Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.
.PP
You may want to specify as many of these options as applicable. Unspecified
options cause the terminal driver to make up the parameter values of the
connection.  These values are system dependant and may be in defaults or values
saved from a previous connection.
.PP
For tty windows, the 
.B info
command shows some of the modem control lines
in the status line. These may include `RTS', `CTS', 'DTR', `DSR', `CD' and more.
This depends on the available ioctl()'s and system header files as well as the
on the physical capabilities of the serial board. 
Signals that are logical low (inactive) have their name preceded by
an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is logical high (active).
Signals not supported by the hardware but available to the ioctl() interface
are usually shown low. 
.br
When the CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals is placed 
inside curly braces ({ and }).
When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR bit is set, the signals `CTS' or `CD' 
are shown in parenthesis, respectively. 


For tty windows, the command
.B break
causes the Data transmission line (TxD) to go low for a specified period of
time. This is expected to be interpreted as break signal on the other side.
No data is sent and no modem control line is changed when a 
.B break
is issued.

.IP \(bu
If the first parameter is \*Q//telnet\*U, the second parameter is expected to
be a host name, and an optional third parameter may specify a TCP port number
(default decimal 23).  Screen will connect to a server listening on the remote
host and use the telnet protocol to communicate with that server.
.br
.br
For telnet windows, the command
.B info
shows details about the connection in square brackets ([ and ]) at the end of

.RS
.IP b
BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.
.IP e
ECHO. Local echo is disabled.
.IP c
SGA. The connection is in `character mode' (default: `line mode').
.IP t
TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the remote host.
Screen sends the name \*Qscreen\*U unless instructed otherwise (see also
the command `term').

.SH "STRING ESCAPES"
Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the
current time into messages or file names. The escape character
is '%' with one exception: inside of a window's hardstatus '^%' ('^E')
is used instead.

Here is the full list of supported escapes:
.IP %
the escape character itself
.IP a
either 'am' or 'pm'
.IP A
either 'AM' or 'PM'
.IP c
current time HH:MM in 24h format
.IP C
current time HH:MM in 12h format
.IP d
day number
.IP D
weekday name
.IP f
flags of the window
.IP F
sets %? to true if the window has the focus
.IP h
hardstatus of the window
.IP H
hostname of the system
.IP l
current load of the system
.IP m
month number
.IP M
month name
.IP n
window number
.IP s
seconds
.IP t
window title
.IP u
all other users on this window
.IP w
all window numbers and names. With '-' quailifier: up to the current
window; with '+' qualifier: starting with the window after the current
one.
.IP W
all window numbers and names except the current one
.IP y
last two digits of the year number
.IP Y
full year number
.IP ?
the part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape
inside the part expands to a non-empty string
.IP :
else part of '%?'
.IP =
pad the string to the display's width (like TeX's hfill). If a
number is specified, pad to the percentage of the window's width.
A '0' qualifier tells screen to treat the number as absolute position.
You can specify to pad relative to the last absolute pad position
by adding a '+' qualifier or to pad relative to the right margin
by using '-'. The padding truncates the string if the specified
position lies before the current position. Add the 'L' qualifier
to change this.
.IP <
same as '%=' but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces
.IP >
mark the current text position for the next truncation. When
screen needs to do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that
the marked position gets moved to the specified percentage of
the output area. (The area starts from the last absolute pad
position and ends with the position specified by the truncation
operator.) The 'L' qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated
parts with '...'.
.IP {
attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next \*Q}\*U
.IP `
Substitute with the output of a 'backtick' command. The length
qualifier is misused to identify one of the commands.
.P
The 'c' and 'C' escape may be qualified with a '0' to make 
.I screen 
use zero instead of space as fill character. The '0' qualifier
also makes the '=' escape use absolute positions. The 'n' and '='
escapes understand
a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n'), 'D' and 'M' can be prefixed with 'L'
to generate long names, 'w' and 'W' also show the window flags
if 'L' is given.
.PP
An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or the
color settings. Its format
is \*Q[attribute modifier] [color description]\*U. The attribute modifier
must be prefixed by a change type indicator if it can be confused with
a color desciption. The following change types are known:
.IP +
add the specified set to the current attributes
.IP -
remove the set from the current attributes
.IP !
invert the set in the current attributes
.IP =
change the current attributes to the specified set
.PP
The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or
a combination of the following letters:
.IP d
dim
.PD 0
.IP u
underline
.IP b
bold
.IP r
reverse
.IP s
standout
.IP B
blinking
.PD
.PP
Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying
the desired background and foreground color (in that order). The following
colors are known:
.IP k
black
.PD 0
.IP r
red
.IP g
green
.IP y
yellow
.IP b
blue
.IP m
magenta
.IP c
cyan
.IP w
white
.IP d
default color
.IP .
leave color unchanged
.PD
.PP
The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors. You can also
use the pseudo-color 'i' to set just the brightness and leave the color
unchanged.
.br
A one digit/letter color description is treated as foreground or
background color dependant on the current attributes: if reverse mode is
set, the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.
If you don't like this, prefix the color with a \*Q.\*U. If you want
the same behaviour for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them
with a \*Q.\*U.
.br
As a special case, \*Q%{-}\*U restores the attributes and colors that
were set before the last change was made (i.e. pops one level of the
color-change stack).
.PP
Examples:
.IP "\*QG\*U"
set color to bright green
.IP "\*Q+b r\*U"
use bold red
.IP "\*Q= yd\*U"
clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.
.IP "%-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%<"
The available windows centered at the current window and truncated to
the available width. The current window is displayed white on blue.
This can be used with \*Qhardstatus alwayslastline\*U.
.IP "%?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?"
The window number and title and the window's hardstatus, if one is set.
Also use a red background if this is the active focus. Useful for
\*Qcaption string\*U.
.SH "FLOW-CONTROL"
Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how
.I screen
deals with
the XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps the interrupt character).
When flow-control is turned off,
.I screen
ignores the XON and XOFF characters,
which allows the user to send them to the current program by simply typing
them (useful for the \fIemacs\fP editor, for instance).
The trade-off is that it will take longer for output from a \*Qnormal\*U
program to pause in response to an XOFF.
With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF characters are used to immediately
pause the output of the current window.
You can still send these characters to the current program, but you must use
the appropriate two-character
.I screen
commands (typically \*QC-a q\*U (xon)
and \*QC-a s\*U (xoff)).
The xon/xoff commands are also useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal
that intercepts these characters.
.PP
Each window has an initial flow-control value set with either the
.B \-f
option or the \*Qdefflow\*U .screenrc command. Per default the windows
are set to automatic flow-switching.
It can then be toggled between the three states 'fixed on', 'fixed off'
and 'automatic' interactively with the \*Qflow\*U command bound to "C-a f".
.PP
The automatic flow-switching mode deals with
flow control using the TIOCPKT mode (like \*Qrlogin\*U does). If
the tty driver does not support TIOCPKT,
.I screen
tries to find out
the right mode based on the current setting of the application
keypad \- when it is enabled, flow-control is turned off and visa versa.
Of course, you can still manipulate flow-control manually when needed.
.PP
If you're running with flow-control enabled and find that pressing the
interrupt key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until another
6-8 lines have scrolled by, try running
.I screen
with the \*Qinterrupt\*U
option (add the \*Qinterrupt\*U flag to the \*Qflow\*U command in
your .screenrc, or use the
.B \-i
command-line option).
This causes the output that
.I screen
has accumulated from the interrupted program to be flushed.
One disadvantage is that the virtual terminal's memory contains the
non-flushed version of the output, which in rare cases can cause
minor inaccuracies in the output.
For example, if you switch screens and return, or update the screen
with \*QC-a l\*U you would see the version of the output you would
have gotten without \*Qinterrupt\*U being on.
Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or use auto-flow mode to turn
it off automatically) when running a program that expects you to type the
interrupt character as input, as it is possible to interrupt
the output of the virtual terminal to your physical terminal when flow-control
is enabled.
If this happens, a simple refresh of the screen with \*QC-a l\*U will
restore it.
Give each mode a try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.


.SH "TITLES (naming windows)"
You can customize each window's name in the window display (viewed with the
\*Qwindows\*U command (C-a w)) by setting it with one of
the title commands.
Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of the program
created in the window.
However, it is sometimes useful to distinguish various programs of the same
name or to change the name on-the-fly to reflect the current state of
the window.
.PP
The default name for all shell windows can be set with the \*Qshelltitle\*U
command in the .screenrc file, while all other windows are created with
a \*Qscreen\*U command and thus can have their name set with the
.B \-t
option.
Interactively, there is the title-string escape-sequence
(<esc>k\fIname\fP<esc>\e) and the \*Qtitle\*U command (C-a A).
The former can be output from an application to control the window's name
under software control, and the latter will prompt for a name when typed.
You can also bind pre-defined names to keys with the \*Qtitle\*U command
to set things quickly without prompting.
.PP
Finally,
.I screen
has a shell-specific heuristic that is enabled by setting the window's name
to \*Q\fIsearch|name\fP\*U and arranging to have a null title escape-sequence
output as a part of your prompt.
The \fIsearch\fP portion specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while
the \fIname\fP portion specifies the default shell name for the window.
If the \fIname\fP ends in a `:'
.I screen
will add what it believes to be the current command running in the window
to the end of the window's shell name (e.\|g. \*Q\fIname:cmd\fP\*U).
Otherwise the current command name supersedes the shell name while it is
running.
.PP
Here's how it works:  you must modify your shell prompt to output a null
title-escape-sequence (<esc>k<esc>\e) as a part of your prompt.
The last part of your prompt must be the same as the string you specified
for the \fIsearch\fP portion of the title.
Once this is set up,
.I screen
will use the title-escape-sequence to clear the previous command name and
get ready for the next command.
Then, when a newline is received from the shell, a search is made for the
end of the prompt.
If found, it will grab the first word after the matched string and use it
as the command name.
If the command name begins with either '!', '%', or '^'
.I screen
will use the first word on the following line (if found) in preference to
the just-found name.
This helps csh users get better command names when using job control or
history recall commands.
.PP
Here's some .screenrc examples:
.IP
screen -t top 2 nice top
.PP
Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d version of the
\*Qtop\*U command in window 2 named \*Qtop\*U rather than \*Qnice\*U.
.sp
.nf
	shelltitle '> |csh'
	screen 1
.fi
.sp
These commands would start a shell with the given shelltitle.
The title specified is an auto-title that would expect the prompt and
the typed command to look something like the following:
.IP
/usr/joe/src/dir> trn
.PP
(it looks after the '> ' for the command name).
The window status would show the name \*Qtrn\*U while the command was
running, and revert to \*Qcsh\*U upon completion.
.IP
bind R screen -t '% |root:' su
.PP
Having this command in your .screenrc would bind the key
sequence \*QC-a R\*U to the \*Qsu\*U command and give it an
auto-title name of \*Qroot:\*U.
For this auto-title to work, the screen could look something
like this:
.sp
.nf
	% !em
	emacs file.c
.fi
.sp
Here the user typed the csh history command \*Q!em\*U which ran the
previously entered \*Qemacs\*U command.
The window status would show \*Qroot:emacs\*U during the execution
of the command, and revert to simply \*Qroot:\*U at its completion.
.PP
.nf
	bind o title
	bind E title ""
	bind u title (unknown)
.fi
.sp
The first binding doesn't have any arguments, so it would prompt you
for a title. when you type \*QC-a o\*U.
The second binding would clear an auto-title's current setting (C-a E).
The third binding would set the current window's title to \*Q(unknown)\*U
(C-a u).
.PP
One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence to
your prompt is that some shells (like the csh) count all the non-control
characters as part of the prompt's length.
If these invisible characters aren't a multiple of 8 then backspacing over
a tab will result in an incorrect display.
One way to get around this is to use a prompt like this:
.IP
set prompt='^[[0000m^[k^[\e% '
.PP
The escape-sequence \*Q<esc>[0000m\*U not only normalizes the character
attributes, but all the zeros round the length of the invisible characters
up to 8.
Bash users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in the
PROMPT_COMMAND:
.IP
PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n -e "\e033k\e033\e134"'
.PP
(I used \*Q\134\*U to output a `\e' because of a bug in bash v1.04).


.SH "THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL"
Each window in a 
.I screen
session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some extra functions added. The
VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other terminal types can be emulated.
.br
Usually
.I screen
tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard
as possible. But if your terminal lacks certain capabilities,
the emulation may not be complete. In these cases
.I screen
has to tell the applications that some of the features
are missing. This is no problem on machines using termcap,
because
.I screen
can use the $TERMCAP variable to
customize the standard
.I screen
termcap.
.PP
But if you do a
rlogin on another machine or your machine supports only
terminfo this method fails. Because of this,
.I screen
offers a way to deal with these cases. 
Here is how it works:
.PP
When 
.I screen
tries to figure out a terminal name for itself,
it first looks
for an entry named \*Qscreen.<term>\*U, where <term> is
the contents of your $TERM variable.
If no such entry exists,
.I screen
tries \*Qscreen\*U (or \*Qscreen-w\*U if the terminal is wide
(132 cols or more)).
If even this entry cannot be found, \*Qvt100\*U is used as a
substitute.
.PP
The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn't
support an important feature (e.g. delete char or clear to EOS)
you can build a new termcap/terminfo entry for
.I screen
(named \*Qscreen.<dumbterm>\*U) in which this capability
has been disabled. If this entry is installed on your
machines you are able to do
a rlogin and still keep the correct termcap/terminfo entry.
The terminal name is put in the $TERM variable
of all new windows.
.I Screen
also sets the $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities
of the virtual terminal emulated. Notice that, however, on machines
using the terminfo database this variable has no effect.
Furthermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the window number
of each window.
.PP
The actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual terminal
depends on the capabilities supported by the physical terminal.
If, for instance, the physical terminal does not support underscore mode,
.I screen
does not put the `us' and `ue' capabilities into the window's $TERMCAP
variable, accordingly.
However, a minimum number of capabilities must be supported by a
terminal in order to run
.IR screen ;
namely scrolling, clear screen, and direct cursor addressing
(in addition,
.I screen
does not run on hardcopy terminals or on terminals that over-strike).
.PP
Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by
.I screen
by using the \*Qtermcap\*U .screenrc command, or
by defining the variable $SCREENCAP prior to startup.
When the is latter defined, its value will be copied verbatim into each
window's $TERMCAP variable.
This can either be the full terminal definition, or a filename where the
terminal \*Qscreen\*U (and/or \*Qscreen-w\*U) is defined.
.PP
Note that 
.I screen
honors the \*Qterminfo\*U .screenrc command if the system uses the
terminfo database rather than termcap.
.PP
When the boolean `G0' capability is present in the termcap entry
for the terminal on which
.I screen
has been called, the terminal emulation of
.I screen
supports multiple character sets.
This allows an application to make use of, for instance,
the VT100 graphics character set or national character sets.
The following control functions from ISO 2022 are supported:
\fIlock shift G0\fP (\fISI\fP), \fIlock shift G1\fP (\fISO\fP),
\fIlock shift G2\fP, \fIlock shift G3\fP, \fIsingle shift G2\fP,
and \fIsingle shift G3\fP.
When a virtual terminal is created or reset, the ASCII character
set is designated as \fIG0\fP through \fIG3\fP.
When the `G0' capability is present,
.I screen
evaluates the capabilities
`S0', `E0', and `C0' if present. `S0' is the sequence the terminal uses
to enable and start the graphics character set rather than \fISI\fP. 
`E0' is the corresponding replacement for \fISO\fP. `C0' gives a character
by character translation string that is used during semi-graphics mode. This 
string is built like the `acsc' terminfo capability.
.PP
When the `po' and `pf' capabilities are present in the terminal's
termcap entry, applications running in a
.I screen
window can send output to the printer port of the terminal.
This allows a user to have an application in one window
sending output to a printer connected to the terminal, while all
other windows are still active (the printer port is enabled
and disabled again for each chunk of output).
As a side-effect, programs running in different windows can
send output to the printer simultaneously.
Data sent to the printer is not displayed in the window.  The 
.I info
command displays a line starting `PRIN' while the printer is active.
.PP
.I Screen
maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If a window
gets selected, the display's hardstatus will be updated to match
the window's hardstatus line. If the display has no hardstatus
the line will be displayed as a standard 
.I screen 
message.
The hardstatus line can be changed with the ANSI Application
Program Command (APC): \*QESC_<string>ESC\e\*U. As a convenience
for xterm users the sequence \*QESC]0..2;<string>^G\*U is
also accepted.
.PP
Some capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP
variable of the virtual terminal if they can be efficiently
implemented by the physical terminal.
For instance, `dl' (delete line) is only put into the $TERMCAP
variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself or
scrolling regions. Note that this may provoke confusion, when 
the session is reattached on a different terminal, as the value
of $TERMCAP cannot be modified by parent processes.
.PP
The "alternate screen" capability is not enabled by default.
Set the \fBaltscreen\fP .screenrc command to enable it.
.PP
The following is a list of control sequences recognized by
.IR screen .
\*Q(V)\*U and \*Q(A)\*U indicate VT100-specific and ANSI- or

.SH "INPUT TRANSLATION"
In order to do a full VT100 emulation 
.I screen
has to detect
that a sequence of characters in the input stream was generated
by a keypress on the user's keyboard and insert the VT100
style escape sequence. \fIScreen\fP has a very flexible way of doing
this by making it possible to map arbitrary commands on arbitrary
sequences of characters. For standard VT100 emulation the command
will always insert a string in the input buffer of the window
(see also command \fBstuff\fP in the command table).
Because the sequences generated by a keypress can
change after a reattach from a different terminal type, it is
possible to bind commands to the termcap name of the keys.
\fIScreen\fP will insert the correct binding after each
reattach. See the \fBbindkey\fP command for further details on the
syntax and examples.
.PP
Here is the table of the default key bindings. (A) means that the
command is executed if the keyboard is switched into application
mode.

.SH SPECIAL TERMINAL CAPABILITIES
The following table describes all terminal capabilities
that are recognized by 
.I screen
and are not in the termcap(5) manual.
You can place these capabilities in your termcap entries (in
`/etc/termcap') or use them with the commands `termcap', `terminfo' and
`termcapinfo' in your screenrc files. It is often not possible to place
these capabilities in the terminfo database.
.PP
.ta 5n
.TP 13
.BI LP "	(bool)"
Terminal has VT100 style margins (`magic margins'). Note that
this capability is obsolete because 
.I screen
uses the standard 'xn' instead.
.TP 13
.BI Z0 "	(str)"
Change width to 132 columns.
.TP 13
.BI Z1 "	(str)"
Change width to 80 columns.
.TP 13
.BI WS "	(str)"
Resize display. This capability has the desired width and height as
arguments. \fISunView(tm)\fP example: '\eE[8;%d;%dt'.
.TP 13
.BI NF "	(bool)"
Terminal doesn't need flow control. Send ^S and ^Q direct to
the application. Same as 'flow off'. The opposite of this
capability is 'nx'.
.TP 13
.BI G0 "	(bool)"
Terminal can deal with ISO 2022 font selection sequences.
.TP 13
.BI S0 "	(str)"
Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset. Default
is '\eE(%.'.
.TP 13
.BI E0 "	(str)"
Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset. Default
is '\eE(B'.
.TP 13
.BI C0 "	(str)"
Use the string as a conversion table for font '0'. See
the 'ac' capability for more details.
.TP 13
.BI CS "	(str)"
Switch cursor-keys to application mode.
.TP 13
.BI CE "	(str)"
Switch cursor-keys back to normal mode.
.TP 13
.BI AN "	(bool)"
Turn on autonuke. See the 'autonuke' command for more details.
.TP 13
.BI OL "	(num)"
Set the output buffer limit. See the 'obuflimit' command for more details.
.TP 13
.BI KJ "	(str)"
Set the encoding of the terminal. See the 'encoding' command for
valid encodings.
.TP 13
.BI AF "	(str)"
Change character foreground color in an ANSI conform way. This
capability will almost always be set to '\eE[3%dm' ('\eE[3%p1%dm'
on terminfo machines).
.TP 13
.BI AB "	(str)"
Same as 'AF', but change background color.
.TP 13
.BI AX "	(bool)"
Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color (\eE[39m / \eE[49m).
.TP 13
.BI XC "	(str)"
Describe a translation of characters to strings depending on the
current font. More details follow in the next section.
.TP 13
.BI XT "	(bool)"
Terminal understands special xterm sequences (OSC, mouse tracking).
.TP 13
.BI C8 "	(bool)"
Terminal needs bold to display high-intensity colors (e.g. Eterm).
.TP 13
.BI TF "	(bool)"
Add missing capabilities to the termcap/info entry. (Set by default).

.SH CHARACTER TRANSLATION
\fIScreen\fP has a powerful mechanism to translate characters to arbitrary
strings depending on the current font and terminal type.
Use this feature if you want to work with a common standard character
set (say ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more
unusual characters over several national language font pages.

Syntax:
.nf
    \fBXC=\fP\fI<charset-mapping>\fP{\fB,,\fP\fI<charset-mapping>\fP}
    \fI<charset-mapping>\fP := \fI<designator><template>\fP{\fB,\fP\fI<mapping>\fP}
    \fI<mapping>\fP := \fI<char-to-be-mapped><template-arg>\fP
.fi

The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.

A \fI<charset-mapping>\fP tells 
.I screen
how to map characters
in font \fI<designator>\fP ('B': Ascii, 'A': UK, 'K': german, etc.)
to strings. Every \fI<mapping>\fP describes to what string a single
character will be translated. A template mechanism is used, as 
most of the time the codes have a lot in common (for example
strings to switch to and from another charset). Each occurrence
of '%' in \fI<template>\fP gets substituted with the \fI<template-arg>\fP
specified together with the character. If your strings are not
similar at all, then use '%' as a template and place the full
string in \fI<template-arg>\fP. A quoting mechanism was added to make
it possible to use a real '%'. The '\e' character quotes the
special characters '\e', '%', and ','.

Here is an example:

    termcap hp700 'XC=B\eE(K%\eE(B,\e304[,\e326\e\e\e\e,\e334]'

This tells
.I screen
how to translate ISOlatin1 (charset 'B')
upper case umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a
german charset. '\e304' gets translated to '\eE(K[\eE(B' and so on.
Note that this line gets parsed *three* times before the internal
lookup table is built, therefore a lot of quoting is needed to
create a single '\e'.

Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping
translates the unquoted '%' char, it will be sent to the terminal
whenever 
.I screen
switches to the corresponding \fI<designator>\fP. In this
special case the template is assumed to be just '%' because
the charset switch sequence and the character mappings normally
haven't much in common.

This example shows one use of the extension:

    termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\eE(B,[\e304,\e\e\e\e\e326,]\e334'

Here, a part of the german ('K') charset is emulated on an xterm.
If 
.I screen
has to change to the 'K' charset, '\eE(B' will be sent
to the terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The
template is just '%', so the mapping is straightforward: '['
to '\e304', '\e' to '\e326', and ']' to '\e334'.

.SH VERSION
This is version 4.0.2. Its roots are a merge of a custom version
2.3PR7 by Wayne Davison
and several enhancements to Oliver Laumann's version 2.0. Note that all versions
numbered 2.x are copyright by Oliver Laumann. 

.SH AVAILABILITY
The latest official release of 
.I screen
available via anonymous ftp from gnudist.gnu.org, nic.funet.fi or any other 
.I GNU 
distribution site. The home site of
.I screen
is ftp.uni-erlangen.de, in the directory
pub/utilities/screen. The subdirectory `private' contains the latest beta
testing release. If you want to help, send a note to
screen@uni-erlangen.de.

.SH BUGS
.PD
.IP \(bu 3
`dm' (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled
correctly (they are ignored). `xn' is treated as a magic-margin
indicator.
.IP \(bu
.I Screen
has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters.         
But this is the only area where 
.I vttest
is allowed to fail.
.IP \(bu
It is not possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when 
reattaching under a different terminal type.
.IP \(bu
The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra
capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.
.IP \(bu
.I Screen
does not make use of hardware tabs.
.IP \(bu
.I Screen
must be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems in order
to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty device file for
each window.
Special permission may also be required to write the file \*Q/etc/utmp\*U.
.IP \(bu
Entries in \*Q/etc/utmp\*U are not removed when
.I screen
is killed with SIGKILL.
This will cause some programs (like "w" or "rwho")
to advertise that a user is logged on who really isn't.
.IP \(bu
.I Screen
may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.
.IP \(bu
When the modem line was hung up, 
.I screen
may not automatically detach (or quit)
unless the device driver is configured to send a HANGUP signal. 
To detach a 
.I screen
session use the -D or -d command line option.
.IP \(bu
If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still detach a 
session without asking.
.IP \(bu
Both \*Qbreaktype\*U and \*Qdefbreaktype\*U change the break generating
method used by all terminal devices. The first should change a window
specific setting, where the latter should change only the default for new 
windows.
.IP \(bu
When attaching to a multiuser session, the user's .screenrc file is not
sourced. Each user's personal settings have to be included in the .screenrc
file from which the session is booted, or have to be changed manually.
.IP \(bu
A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the features.

.Dt SCRIPT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adkpqr
.Op Fl F Ar pipe
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Op Ar file Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar command
is given,
.Nm
will run the specified command with an optional argument vector
instead of an interactive shell.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.It Fl d
When playing back a session with the
.Fl p
flag, do not sleep between records when playing back a timestamped session.
.It Fl F Ar pipe
Immediately flush output after each write.
This will allow a user to create a named pipe using
.Xr mkfifo 1
and another user may watch the live session using a utility like
.Xr cat 1 .
.\".It Fl f
.\"Create
.\".Ar file.filemon
.\"or
.\".Pa typescript.filemon
.\"using
.\".Xr filemon 4 .
.It Fl k
Log keys sent to the program as well as output.
.It Fl p
Play back a session recorded with the
.Fl r
flag in real time.
.It Fl q
Run in quiet mode, omit the start, stop and command status messages.
.It Fl r
Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.
.It Fl t Ar time
Specify the interval at which the script output file will be flushed
to disk, in seconds.
A value of 0
causes
.Nm
to flush after every character I/O event.
The default interval is
30 seconds.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell (or command) exits (a
.Em control-D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf ( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Em exit ,
.Em logout
or
.Em control-D
(if
.Em ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
The
.Nm
utility works best with commands that do not manipulate the screen.
The results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal, not an addressable one.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are utilized by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SCRIPT
The
.Ev SCRIPT
environment variable is added to the sub-shell.
If
.Ev SCRIPT
already existed in the users environment,
its value is overwritten within the sub-shell.
The value of
.Ev SCRIPT
is the name of the
.Ar typescript
file.
.It Ev SHELL
If the variable
.Ev SHELL
exists, the shell forked by
.Nm
will be that shell.
If
.Ev SHELL
is not set, the Bourne shell
is assumed.
.Pq Most shells set this variable automatically .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1
.\".Xr filemon 4
.\".Po
.\"for the
.\".Em history
.\"mechanism
.\".Pc .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Pp
The
.Fl d ,
.Fl p
and
.Fl r
options first appeared in
.Nx 2.0
and were ported to
.Fx 9.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility places
.Sy everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
.Pp
It is not possible to specify a command without also naming the script file
because of argument parsing compatibility issues.
.Pp
When running in
.Fl k
mode, echo cancelling is far from ideal.
The slave terminal mode is checked
for ECHO mode to check when to avoid manual echo logging.
This does not
work when the terminal is in a raw mode where
the program being run is doing manual echo.
.Pp
If
.Nm
reads zero bytes from the terminal, it switches to a mode when it
only attempts to read
once a second until there is data to read.
This prevents
.Nm
from spinning on zero-byte reads, but might cause a 1-second delay in
processing of user input.

.SH NAME
sdx \- Starkit Developer eXtension
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsdx\fR combines a number of functions into a single command-line developer
utility. Its most common use is to create, browse, and unravel Starkits:
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBqwrap\fR \fImyscript.tcl\fR ?\fIoptions\fR ...?
create a starkit from a single Tcl script
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBwrap\fR \fImystar.kit\fR ?\fIoptions\fR ...?
create a starkit from a mystar.vfs directory structure
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBunwrap\fR \fImystar.kit\fR
the reverse of wrap, lets you dissect any starkit
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBlsk\fR \fImystar.kit\fR
list the contents of a starkit, as seen when mounted in Tcl
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBversion\fR \fImystar.kit\fR
calculate the version ID of a starkit, report newest file found inside
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBmkpack\fR \fIoldstar.kit\fR \fInewstar.kit\fR
copy and optimally pack the Metakit data by removing all unused areas
.TP
\fBsdx\fR \fBmksplit\fR \fImystar.kit\fR
split a starkit into mystar.head and a mystar.tail parts
.PP
\fBsdx\fR also has other, less frequently used commands, see
\fBsdx\fR \fBhelp\fR and \fBsdx\fR \fBhelp\fR \fIcommand\fR for more
information.
.PP
\fBsdx\fR is itself a Starkit, you can inspect its contents by doing
\fBsdx\fR \fBunwrap\fR \fB`which sdx`\fR.

.Pc
will be displayed and the user will be able to type commands on stdin until an EOF is encountered.
.It Fl l
Before
.Nm
exits, run
.Dl "/usr/bin/leaks -nocontext"
on itself to see if the command(s) you executed had any leaks.
.It Fl p Ar prompt
This option implies the

The identity is located by searching the specified keychain(s) for a certificate whose common name contains
the given identity string. If no keychains are specified to search, the default search list is used. Different
identity preferences can be set for individual key usages. You can differentiate between two identities which contain
the same string by providing a SHA-1 hash of the certificate (in addition to, or instead of, the name.)
.It
.Sy PARTIAL PATHS AND WILDCARDS
.It
Prior to 10.5.4, identity preferences for SSL/TLS client authentication could only be set on a per-URL basis. The
URL being visited had to match the service name exactly for the preference to be in effect.
.It
In 10.5.4, it became possible to specify identity preferences on a per-server basis, by using
a service name with a partial path URL to match more specific paths on the same server. For
example, if an identity preference for "https://www.apache-ssl.org/" exists, it will be in effect for
"https://www.apache-ssl.org/cgi/cert-export", and so on. Note that partial path URLs must end with a trailing
slash character.
.It
Starting with 10.6, it is possible to specify identity preferences on a per-domain
basis, by using the wildcard character '*' as the leftmost component of the service name. Unlike SSL wildcards,
an identity preference wildcard can match more than one subdomain. For example, an identity preference for
the name "*.army.mil" will match "server1.subdomain1.army.mil" or "server2.subdomain2.army.mil". Likewise,
a preference for "*.mil" will match both "server.army.mil" and "server.navy.mil".

to enforce access controls and to keep private keys out of
user process address space.  Authorization calls also communicate with 
.Nm
to enforce rules contained in the

.Nm
is mediated through the
.Nm "Security Agent."

.Nd stream editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ealn
.Ar command
.Op Ar
.Nm
.Op Fl Ealn
.Op Fl e Ar command
.Op Fl f Ar command_file
.Op Fl i Ar extension
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files
are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of commands.
The input is then written to the standard output.
.Pp
A single command may be specified as the first argument to
.Nm .
Multiple commands may be specified by using the
.Fl e
or
.Fl f
options.
All commands are applied to the input in the order they are specified
regardless of their origin.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E
Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular expressions
rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).
The
.Xr re_format 7
manual page fully describes both formats.
.It Fl a
The files listed as parameters for the
.Dq w
functions are created (or truncated) before any processing begins,
by default.
The
.Fl a
option causes
.Nm
to delay opening each file until a command containing the related
.Dq w
function is applied to a line of input.
.It Fl e Ar command
Append the editing commands specified by the
.Ar command
argument
to the list of commands.
.It Fl f Ar command_file
Append the editing commands found in the file
.Ar command_file
to the list of commands.
The editing commands should each be listed on a separate line.
.It Fl i Ar extension
Edit files in-place, saving backups with the specified
.Ar extension .
If a zero-length
.Ar extension
is given, no backup will be saved.
It is not recommended to give a zero-length
.Ar extension
when in-place editing files, as you risk corruption or partial content
in situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.
.It Fl l
Make output line buffered.
.It Fl n
By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output after
all of the commands have been applied to it.
The
.Fl n
option suppresses this behavior.
.El
.Pp
The form of a
.Nm
command is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl [address[,address]]function[arguments]
.Pp
Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function
portions of the command.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
cyclically copies a line of input, not including its terminating newline
character, into a
.Em "pattern space" ,
(unless there is something left after a
.Dq D
function),
applies all of the commands with addresses that select that pattern space,
copies the pattern space to the standard output, appending a newline, and
deletes the pattern space.
.Pp
Some of the functions use a
.Em "hold space"
to save all or part of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval.
.Sh "Sed Addresses"
An address is not required, but if specified must be a number (that counts
input lines
cumulatively across input files), a dollar
.Pq Dq $
character that addresses the last line of input, or a context address
(which consists of a regular expression preceded and followed by a
delimiter).
.Pp
A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.
.Pp
A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces
that match the address.
.Pp
A command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range.
This
range starts with the first pattern space that matches the first
address.
The end of the range is the next following pattern space
that matches the second address.
If the second address is a number
less than or equal to the line number first selected, only that
line is selected.
In the case when the second address is a context
address,
.Nm
does not re-match the second address against the
pattern space that matched the first address.
Starting at the
first line following the selected range,
.Nm
starts looking again for the first address.
.Pp
Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use
of the exclamation character
.Pq Dq \&!
function.
.Sh "Sed Regular Expressions"
The regular expressions used in
.Nm ,
by default, are basic regular expressions (BREs, see
.Xr re_format 7
for more information), but extended (modern) regular expressions can be used
instead if the
.Fl E
flag is given.
In addition,
.Nm
has the following two additions to regular expressions:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
In a context address, any character other than a backslash
.Pq Dq \e
or newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression.
Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting character
causes the character to be treated literally.
For example, in the context address \exabc\exdefx, the RE delimiter
is an
.Dq x
and the second
.Dq x
stands for itself, so that the regular expression is
.Dq abcxdef .
.Pp
.It
The escape sequence \en matches a newline character embedded in the
pattern space.
You cannot, however, use a literal newline character in an address or
in the substitute command.
.El
.Pp
One special feature of
.Nm
regular expressions is that they can default to the last regular
expression used.
If a regular expression is empty, i.e., just the delimiter characters
are specified, the last regular expression encountered is used instead.
The last regular expression is defined as the last regular expression
used as part of an address or substitute command, and at run-time, not
compile-time.
For example, the command
.Dq /abc/s//XXX/
will substitute
.Dq XXX
for the pattern
.Dq abc .
.Sh "Sed Functions"
In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible
addresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr],
representing zero, one, or two addresses.
.Pp
The argument
.Em text
consists of one or more lines.
To embed a newline in the text, precede it with a backslash.
Other backslashes in text are deleted and the following character
taken literally.
.Pp
The
.Dq r
and
.Dq w
functions take an optional file parameter, which should be separated
from the function letter by white space.
Each file given as an argument to
.Nm
is created (or its contents truncated) before any input processing begins.
.Pp
The
.Dq b ,
.Dq r ,
.Dq s ,
.Dq t ,
.Dq w ,
.Dq y ,
.Dq \&! ,
and
.Dq \&:
functions all accept additional arguments.
The following synopses indicate which arguments have to be separated from
the function letters by white space characters.
.Pp
Two of the functions take a function-list.
This is a list of
.Nm
functions separated by newlines, as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
{ function
  function
  ...
  function
}
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dq {
can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white space.
The function can be preceded by white space.
The terminating
.Dq }
must be preceded by a newline or optional white space.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXX" -compact
.It [2addr] function-list
Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected.
.Pp
.It [1addr]a\e
.It text
Write
.Em text
to standard output immediately before each attempt to read a line of input,
whether by executing the
.Dq N
function or by beginning a new cycle.
.Pp
.It [2addr]b[label]
Branch to the
.Dq \&:
function with the specified label.
If the label is not specified, branch to the end of the script.
.Pp
.It [2addr]c\e
.It text
Delete the pattern space.
With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a 2-address range,
.Em text
is written to the standard output.
.Pp
.It [2addr]d
Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.
.Pp
.It [2addr]D
Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
newline character and start the next cycle.
.Pp
.It [2addr]g
Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of the
hold space.
.Pp
.It [2addr]G
Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold space
to the pattern space.
.Pp
.It [2addr]h
Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
pattern space.
.Pp
.It [2addr]H
Append a newline character followed by the contents of the pattern space
to the hold space.
.Pp
.It [1addr]i\e
.It text
Write
.Em text
to the standard output.
.Pp
.It [2addr]l
(The letter ell.)
Write the pattern space to the standard output in a visually unambiguous
form.
This form is as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "carriage-returnXX" -offset indent -compact
.It backslash
\e\e
.It alert
\ea
.It form-feed
\ef
.It carriage-return
\er
.It tab
\et
.It vertical tab
\ev
.El
.Pp
Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers (with a
preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most significant byte
first).
Long lines are folded, with the point of folding indicated by displaying
a backslash followed by a newline.
The end of each line is marked with a
.Dq $ .
.Pp
.It [2addr]n
Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default output has
not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space with the next line of
input.
.Pp
.It [2addr]N
Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an embedded
newline character to separate the appended material from the original
contents.
Note that the current line number changes.
.Pp
.It [2addr]p
Write the pattern space to standard output.
.Pp
.It [2addr]P
Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the
standard output.
.Pp
.It [1addr]q
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new cycle.
.Pp
.It [1addr]r file
Copy the contents of
.Em file
to the standard output immediately before the next attempt to read a
line of input.
If
.Em file
cannot be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error
condition is set.
.Pp
.It [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags
Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the regular
expression in the pattern space.
Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of
a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement.
Within the RE and the replacement, the RE delimiter itself can be used as
a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.
.Pp
An ampersand
.Pq Dq &
appearing in the replacement is replaced by the string matching the RE.
The special meaning of
.Dq &
in this context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash.
The string
.Dq \e# ,
where
.Dq #
is a digit, is replaced by the text matched
by the corresponding backreference expression (see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.Pp
A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it.
To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede it with
a backslash.
.Pp
The value of
.Em flags
in the substitute function is zero or more of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXX" -offset indent
.It Ar N
Make the substitution only for the
.Ar N Ns 'th
occurrence of the regular expression in the pattern space.
.It g
Make the substitution for all non-overlapping matches of the
regular expression, not just the first one.
.It p
Write the pattern space to standard output if a replacement was made.
If the replacement string is identical to that which it replaces, it
is still considered to have been a replacement.
.It w Em file
Append the pattern space to
.Em file
if a replacement was made.
If the replacement string is identical to that which it replaces, it
is still considered to have been a replacement.
.El
.Pp
.It [2addr]t [label]
Branch to the
.Dq \&:
function bearing the label if any substitutions have been made since the
most recent reading of an input line or execution of a
.Dq t
function.
If no label is specified, branch to the end of the script.
.Pp
.It [2addr]w Em file
Append the pattern space to the
.Em file .
.Pp
.It [2addr]x
Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.
.Pp
.It [2addr]y/string1/string2/
Replace all occurrences of characters in
.Em string1
in the pattern space with the corresponding characters from
.Em string2 .
Any character other than a backslash or newline can be used instead of
a slash to delimit the strings.
Within
.Em string1
and
.Em string2 ,
a backslash followed by an ``n'' is replaced by a newline
character.
A pair of backslashes is replaced by a literal backslash.
Finally, a backslash followed by any other character
(except a newline) is that literal character.
.Pp
.It [2addr]!function
.It [2addr]!function-list
Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are
.Em not
selected by the address(es).
.Pp
.It [0addr]:label
This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the
.Dq b
and
.Dq t
commands may branch.
.Pp
.It [1addr]=
Write the line number to the standard output followed by a newline
character.
.Pp
.It [0addr]
Empty lines are ignored.
.Pp
.It [0addr]#
The
.Dq #
and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a comment), with
the single exception that if the first two characters in the file are
.Dq #n ,
the default output is suppressed.
This is the same as specifying the
.Fl n
option on the command line.

.SH NAME
seeksize.d \- print disk event seek report. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seeksize.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
seeksize.d is a simple DTrace program to print a report of disk
event seeks by process. 

This can be used to identify whether processes are accessing the
disks in a "random" or "sequential" manner. Sequential is often
desirable, indicated by mostly zero length seeks.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Sample until Ctrl\-C is hit then print report,
# 
.B seeksize.d
.PP
.SH FIELDS
.TP
PID
process ID
.TP
CMD
command and argument list
.TP
value
distance in disk blocks (sectors)
.TP
count
number of I/O operations
.PP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the 
Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
.SH EXIT
seeksize.d will sample until Ctrl\-C is hit.

\fBmailq\fR
\fBsendmail -bp\fR

\fBnewaliases\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix \fBsendmail\fR(1) command implements the Postfix
to Sendmail compatibility interface.
For the sake of compatibility with existing applications, some
Sendmail command-line options are recognized but silently ignored.

By default, Postfix \fBsendmail\fR(1) reads a message from
standard input
until EOF or until it reads a line with only a \fB.\fR character,
and arranges for delivery.  Postfix \fBsendmail\fR(1) relies on the
\fBpostdrop\fR(1) command to create a queue file in the \fBmaildrop\fR
directory.

Specific command aliases are provided for other common modes of
operation:
.IP \fBmailq\fR
List the mail queue. Each entry shows the queue file ID, message
size, arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
be delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt,
the reason for failure is shown. The queue ID string is
followed by an optional status character:
.RS
.IP \fB*\fR
The message is in the \fBactive\fR queue, i.e. the message is
selected for delivery.
.IP \fB!\fR
The message is in the \fBhold\fR queue, i.e. no further delivery
attempt will be made until the mail is taken off hold.
.RE
.IP
This mode of operation is implemented by executing the
\fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.
.IP \fBnewaliases\fR
Initialize the alias database.  If no input file is specified (with
the \fB-oA\fR option, see below), the program processes the file(s)
specified with the \fBalias_database\fR configuration parameter.
If no alias database type is specified, the program uses the type
specified with the \fBdefault_database_type\fR configuration parameter.
This mode of operation is implemented by running the \fBpostalias\fR(1)
command.
.sp
Note: it may take a minute or so before an alias database update
becomes visible. Use the "\fBpostfix reload\fR" command to eliminate
this delay.
.PP
These and other features can be selected by specifying the
appropriate combination of command-line options. Some features are
controlled by parameters in the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file.

The following options are recognized:
.IP "\fB-Am\fR (ignored)"
.IP "\fB-Ac\fR (ignored)"
Postfix sendmail uses the same configuration file regardless of
whether or not a message is an initial submission.
.IP "\fB-B \fIbody_type\fR"
The message body MIME type: \fB7BIT\fR or \fB8BITMIME\fR.
.IP \fB-bd\fR
Go into daemon mode. This mode of operation is implemented by
executing the "\fBpostfix start\fR" command.
.IP "\fB-bh\fR (ignored)"
.IP "\fB-bH\fR (ignored)"
Postfix has no persistent host status database.
.IP \fB-bi\fR
Initialize alias database. See the \fBnewaliases\fR
command above.
.IP \fB-bl\fR
Go into daemon mode. To accept only local connections as
with Sendmail\'s \fB-bl\fR option, specify "\fBinet_interfaces
= loopback\fR" in the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR configuration
file.
.IP \fB-bm\fR
Read mail from standard input and arrange for delivery.
This is the default mode of operation.
.IP \fB-bp\fR
List the mail queue. See the \fBmailq\fR command above.
.IP \fB-bs\fR
Stand-alone SMTP server mode. Read SMTP commands from
standard input, and write responses to standard output.
In stand-alone SMTP server mode, mail relaying and other
access controls are disabled by default. To enable them,
run the process as the \fBmail_owner\fR user.
.sp
This mode of operation is implemented by running the
\fBsmtpd\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fB-bv\fR
Do not collect or deliver a message. Instead, send an email
report after verifying each recipient address.  This is useful
for testing address rewriting and routing configurations.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.
.IP "\fB-C \fIconfig_file\fR"
.IP "\fB-C \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The path name of the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file, or of its
parent directory. This information is ignored with Postfix
versions before 2.3.

With all Postfix versions, you can specify a directory pathname
with the MAIL_CONFIG environment variable to override the
location of configuration files.
.IP "\fB-F \fIfull_name\fR
Set the sender full name. This overrides the NAME environment
variable, and is used only with messages that
have no \fBFrom:\fR message header.
.IP "\fB-f \fIsender\fR"
Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix versions before 2.1, the
\fBErrors-To:\fR message header overrides the error return address.
.IP \fB-G\fR
Gateway (relay) submission, as opposed to initial user
submission.  Either do not rewrite addresses at all, or
update incomplete addresses with the domain information
specified with \fBremote_header_rewrite_domain\fR.

This option is ignored before Postfix version 2.3.
.IP "\fB-h \fIhop_count\fR (ignored)"
Hop count limit. Use the \fBhopcount_limit\fR configuration
parameter instead.
.IP \fB-I\fR
Initialize alias database. See the \fBnewaliases\fR
command above.
.IP "\fB-i\fR"
When reading a message from standard input, don\'t treat a line
with only a \fB.\fR character as the end of input.
.IP "\fB-L \fIlabel\fR (ignored)"
The logging label. Use the \fBsyslog_name\fR configuration
parameter instead.
.IP "\fB-m\fR (ignored)"
Backwards compatibility.
.IP "\fB-N \fIdsn\fR (default: 'delay, failure')"
Delivery status notification control. Specify either a
comma-separated list with one or more of \fBfailure\fR (send
notification when delivery fails), \fBdelay\fR (send
notification when delivery is delayed), or \fBsuccess\fR
(send notification when the message is delivered); or specify
\fBnever\fR (don't send any notifications at all).

This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
.IP "\fB-n\fR (ignored)"
Backwards compatibility.
.IP "\fB-oA\fIalias_database\fR"
Non-default alias database. Specify \fIpathname\fR or
\fItype\fR:\fIpathname\fR. See \fBpostalias\fR(1) for
details.
.IP "\fB-O \fIoption=value\fR (ignored)"
Set the named \fIoption\fR to \fIvalue\fR. Use the equivalent
configuration parameter in \fBmain.cf\fR instead.
.IP "\fB-o7\fR (ignored)"
.IP "\fB-o8\fR (ignored)"
To send 8-bit or binary content, use an appropriate MIME encapsulation
and specify the appropriate \fB-B\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fB-oi\fR"
When reading a message from standard input, don\'t treat a line
with only a \fB.\fR character as the end of input.
.IP "\fB-om\fR (ignored)"
The sender is never eliminated from alias etc. expansions.
.IP "\fB-o \fIx value\fR (ignored)"
Set option \fIx\fR to \fIvalue\fR. Use the equivalent
configuration parameter in \fBmain.cf\fR instead.
.IP "\fB-r \fIsender\fR"
Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix versions before 2.1, the
\fBErrors-To:\fR message header overrides the error return address.
.IP "\fB-R \fIreturn\fR"
Delivery status notification control.  Specify "hdrs" to
return only the header when a message bounces, "full" to
return a full copy (the default behavior).

The \fB-R\fR option specifies an upper bound; Postfix will
return only the header, when a full copy would exceed the
bounce_size_limit setting.

This option is ignored before Postfix version 2.10.
.IP \fB-q\fR
Attempt to deliver all queued mail. This is implemented by
executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.

Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
poor delivery performance of all other mail.
.IP "\fB-q\fIinterval\fR (ignored)"
The interval between queue runs. Use the \fBqueue_run_delay\fR
configuration parameter instead.
.IP \fB-qI\fIqueueid\fR
Schedule immediate delivery of mail with the specified queue
ID.  This option is implemented by executing the
\fBpostqueue\fR(1) command, and is available with Postfix
version 2.4 and later.
.IP \fB-qR\fIsite\fR
Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the named
\fIsite\fR. This option accepts only \fIsite\fR names that are
eligible for the "fast flush" service, and is implemented by
executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.
See \fBflush\fR(8) for more information about the "fast flush"
service.
.IP \fB-qS\fIsite\fR
This command is not implemented. Use the slower "\fBsendmail -q\fR"
command instead.
.IP \fB-t\fR
Extract recipients from message headers. These are added to any
recipients specified on the command line.

With Postfix versions prior to 2.1, this option requires that
no recipient addresses are specified on the command line.
.IP "\fB-U\fR (ignored)"
Initial user submission.
.IP "\fB-V \fIenvid\fR"
Specify the envelope ID for notification by servers that
support DSN.

This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
.IP "\fB-XV\fR (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: \fB-V\fR)"
Variable Envelope Return Path. Given an envelope sender address
of the form \fIowner-listname\fR@\fIorigin\fR, each recipient
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR receives mail with a personalized envelope
sender address.
.sp
By default, the personalized envelope sender address is
\fIowner-listname\fB+\fIuser\fB=\fIdomain\fR@\fIorigin\fR. The default
\fB+\fR and \fB=\fR characters are configurable with the
\fBdefault_verp_delimiters\fR configuration parameter.
.IP "\fB-XV\fIxy\fR (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: \fB-V\fIxy\fR)"
As \fB-XV\fR, but uses \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR as the VERP delimiter
characters, instead of the characters specified with the
\fBdefault_verp_delimiters\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Send an email report of the first delivery attempt (Postfix
versions 2.1 and later). Mail delivery
always happens in the background. When multiple \fB-v\fR
options are given, enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
.IP "\fB-X \fIlog_file\fR (ignored)"
Log mailer traffic. Use the \fBdebug_peer_list\fR and
\fBdebug_peer_level\fR configuration parameters instead.

.Sh NAME
.Nm seq
.Nd print sequences of numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl w
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl s Ar string
.Op Fl t Ar string
.Op Ar first Op Ar incr
.Ar last
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line
.Pq default ,
from
.Ar first
.Pq default 1 ,
to near
.Ar last
as possible, in increments of
.Ar incr
.Pq default 1 .
When
.Ar first
is larger than
.Ar last
the default
.Ar incr
is -1.
.Pp
All numbers are interpreted as floating point.
.Pp
Normally integer values are printed as decimal integers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl f Ar format
Use a
.Xr printf 3
style
.Ar format
to print each number.
Only the
.Cm E ,
.Cm e ,
.Cm f ,
.Cm G ,
.Cm g ,
and
.Cm %
conversion characters are valid, along with any optional
flags and an optional numeric minimum field width or precision.
The
.Ar format
can contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
defined in
.St -ansiC .
The default is
.Cm %g .
.It Fl s Ar string
Use
.Ar string
to separate numbers.
The
.Ar string
can contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
defined in
.St -ansiC .
The default is
.Cm \en .
.It Fl t Ar string
Use
.Ar string
to terminate sequence of numbers.
The
.Ar string
can contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
defined in
.St -ansiC .
This option is useful when the default separator
does not contain a
.Cm \en .
.It Fl w
Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as necessary.
This option has no effect with the
.Fl f
option.
If any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential notation,
the default conversion is changed to
.Cm %e .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Tn "Plan 9 from Bell Labs" .
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 3.0 ,
and ported to
.Fx 9.0 .
This command was based on the command of the same name in
.Tn "Plan 9 from Bell Labs"
and the
.Tn GNU
core utilities.
The
.Tn GNU
.Nm
command first appeared in the 1.13 shell utilities release.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl w
option does not handle the transition from pure floating point
to exponent representation very well.
The
.Nm
command is not bug for bug compatible with the
.Tn "Plan 9 from Bell Labs"
or
.Tn GNU

[\fB\-context \s-1ID\s0\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBsess_id\fR process the encoded version of the \s-1SSL\s0 session structure
and optionally prints out \s-1SSL\s0 session details (for example the \s-1SSL\s0 session
master key) in human readable format. Since this is a diagnostic tool that
needs some knowledge of the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol to use properly, most users will
not need to use it.
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded
format containing session details. The precise format can vary from one version
to the next.  The \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR form is the default format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR
format base64 encoded with additional header and footer lines.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read session information from or standard
input by default.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write session information to or standard
output if this option is not specified.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the various public or private key components in
plain text in addition to the encoded version.
.IP "\fB\-cert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cert"
if a certificate is present in the session it will be output using this option,
if the \fB\-text\fR option is also present then it will be printed out in text form.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the session.
.IP "\fB\-context \s-1ID\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-context ID"
this option can set the session id so the output session information uses the
supplied \s-1ID.\s0 The \s-1ID\s0 can be any string of characters. This option wont normally
be used.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"

.PP
Theses are described below in more detail.
.IP "\fBProtocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "Protocol"
this is the protocol in use TLSv1, SSLv3 or SSLv2.
.IP "\fBCipher\fR" 4
.IX Item "Cipher"
the cipher used this is the actual raw \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1TLS\s0 cipher code, see the \s-1SSL\s0
or \s-1TLS\s0 specifications for more information.
.IP "\fBSession-ID\fR" 4
.IX Item "Session-ID"
the \s-1SSL\s0 session \s-1ID\s0 in hex format.
.IP "\fBSession-ID-ctx\fR" 4
.IX Item "Session-ID-ctx"
the session \s-1ID\s0 context in hex format.
.IP "\fBMaster-Key\fR" 4
.IX Item "Master-Key"
this is the \s-1SSL\s0 session master key.
.IP "\fBKey-Arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "Key-Arg"
the key argument, this is only used in \s-1SSL\s0 v2.
.IP "\fBStart Time\fR" 4
.IX Item "Start Time"
this is the session start time represented as an integer in standard Unix format.
.IP "\fBTimeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "Timeout"
the timeout in seconds.
.IP "\fBVerify return code\fR" 4
.IX Item "Verify return code"
this is the return code when an \s-1SSL\s0 client certificate is verified.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The \s-1PEM\s0 encoded session format uses the header and footer lines:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN SSL SESSION PARAMETERS\-\-\-\-\-
\& \-\-\-\-\-END SSL SESSION PARAMETERS\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
Since the \s-1SSL\s0 session output contains the master key it is possible to read the contents
of an encrypted session using this information. Therefore appropriate security precautions
should be taken if the information is being output by a \*(L"real\*(R" application. This is
however strongly discouraged and should only be used for debugging purposes.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
The cipher and start time should be printed out in human readable form.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interactive file transfer program, similar to
.Xr ftp 1 ,
which performs all operations over an encrypted
.Xr ssh 1
transport.
It may also use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and
compression.
.Nm
connects and logs into the specified
.Ar host ,
then enters an interactive command mode.
.Pp
The second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive
authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after
successful interactive authentication.
.Pp
The third usage format allows
.Nm
to start in a remote directory.
.Pp
The final usage format allows for automated sessions using the
.Fl b
option.
In such cases, it is necessary to configure non-interactive authentication
to obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see
.Xr sshd 8
and
.Xr ssh-keygen 1
for details).
.Pp
Since some usage formats use colon characters to delimit host names from path
names, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1
Specify the use of protocol version 1.
.It Fl 2
Specify the use of protocol version 2.
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl a
Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than overwriting
existing partial or complete copies of files.
If the partial contents differ from those being transferred,
then the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.
.It Fl B Ar buffer_size
Specify the size of the buffer that
.Nm
uses when transferring files.
Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher
memory consumption.
The default is 32768 bytes.
.It Fl b Ar batchfile
Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input
.Ar batchfile
instead of
.Em stdin .
Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with
non-interactive authentication.
A
.Ar batchfile
of
.Sq \-
may be used to indicate standard input.
.Nm
will abort if any of the following
commands fail:
.Ic get , put , reget , reput, rename , ln ,
.Ic rm , mkdir , chdir , ls ,
.Ic lchdir , chmod , chown ,
.Ic chgrp , lpwd , df , symlink ,
and
.Ic lmkdir .
Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command basis by
prefixing the command with a
.Sq \-
character (for example,
.Ic -rm /tmp/blah* ) .
.It Fl C
Enables compression (via ssh's
.Fl C
flag).
.It Fl c Ar cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl D Ar sftp_server_path
Connect directly to a local sftp server
(rather than via
.Xr ssh 1 ) .
This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.
.It Fl F Ar ssh_config
Specifies an alternative
per-user configuration file for
.Xr ssh 1 .
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl f
Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after transfer.
When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if the server
implements the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.
.It Fl i Ar identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key
authentication is read.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl l Ar limit
Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
.It Fl o Ar ssh_option
Can be used to pass options to
.Nm ssh
in the format used in
.Xr ssh_config 5 .
This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate
.Nm sftp
command-line flag.
For example, to specify an alternate port use:
.Ic sftp -oPort=24 .
For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
.Xr ssh_config 5 .

.El
.It Fl P Ar port
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
.It Fl p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original files transferred.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
diagnostic messages from
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl R Ar num_requests
Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time.
Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed
but will increase memory usage.
The default is 64 outstanding requests.
.It Fl r
Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and downloading.
Note that
.Nm
does not follow symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.
.It Fl S Ar program
Name of the
.Ar program
to use for the encrypted connection.
The program must understand
.Xr ssh 1
options.
.It Fl s Ar subsystem | sftp_server
Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server
on the remote host.
A path is useful for using
.Nm
over protocol version 1, or when the remote
.Xr sshd 8
does not have an sftp subsystem configured.
.It Fl v
Raise logging level.
This option is also passed to ssh.
.El
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Once in interactive mode,
.Nm
understands a set of commands similar to those of
.Xr ftp 1 .
Commands are case insensitive.
Pathnames that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotes.
Any special characters contained within pathnames that are recognized by
.Xr glob 3
must be escaped with backslashes

flag is specified, then a request will be sent to the server to call
.Xr fsync 2
after the file has been transferred.
Note that this is only supported by servers that implement
the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.
.Pp
If either the
.Fl P
or
.Fl p
flag is specified, then full file permissions and access times are

.Sh NAME
.Nm shar
.Nd create a shell archive of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes an
.Xr sh 1
shell script to the standard output which will recreate the file
hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the
files they contain (the
.Xr find 1
utility does this correctly).
.Pp
.Nm
is normally used for distributing files by
.Xr ftp  1
or
.Xr mail  1  .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr tar 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 1
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
magic characters.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr ls  1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd ls
shar `find . -print` \&|  mail -s "ls source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir ls
cd ls
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
sh archive
.Ed
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appears in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh  1  .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm
may be easily examined with the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
egrep -v '^[X#]' shar.file
.Ed

By default a share point is enabled for afp, ftp, and smb protocols.
To enable and disable particular services, combine (binary AND) the following flags as required: \
100 (enable sharing for afp), 010 (enable sharing for smb), and 001 (enable sharing for ftp).
Specify 000 to turn off sharing of a share point altogether.
Use a customized name <smb name> if appropriate when using share points with smb.
.It Fl g Ar <guest flag> 
Use this option to enable and disable guest access for afp, ftp, and smb.
By default guest access is enabled for afp, ftp, and smb.
To enable and disable guest access to particular services, combine (binary AND) the following flags as required: \
100 (enable guest for afp), 010 (enable guest for smb), and 001 (enable guest for ftp).
Specify 000 to turn off guest access for a share point altogether.
.It Fl i Ar <inherit privileges flag> 
Use this option to enable and disable the "inherit privileges" attribute for afp, ftp, and smb.
By default "inherit privileges" is enabled for ftp only.
To enable and disable guest access to particular services, combine (binary AND) the following flags as required: \
100 ("inherit privileges" for afp), 010 ("inherit privileges" for smb), and 001 ("inherit privileges" for ftp).
Specify 000 to turn off "inherit privileges" for a share point altogether.
.It Fl n Ar <customized record name>
Specify a <customized record name> to be used as the share point record name.
By default the record name is the name of the directory pointed to by the share point record. 
This directory is specified bt the <path> when the record is created.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Running \fIshasum\fR is often the quickest way to compute \s-1SHA\s0 message
digests.  The user simply feeds data to the script through files or
standard input, and then collects the results from standard output.
.PP
The following command shows how to compute digests for typical inputs
such as the \s-1NIST\s0 test vector \*(L"abc\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl \-e "print qq(abc)" | shasum
.Ve
.PP
Or, if you want to use \s-1SHA\-256\s0 instead of the default \s-1SHA\-1,\s0 simply say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl \-e "print qq(abc)" | shasum \-a 256
.Ve
.PP
Since \fIshasum\fR mimics the behavior of the combined \s-1GNU \s0\fIsha1sum\fR,
\&\fIsha224sum\fR, \fIsha256sum\fR, \fIsha384sum\fR, and \fIsha512sum\fR programs,
you can install this script as a convenient drop-in replacement.
.PP
Unlike the \s-1GNU\s0 programs, \fIshasum\fR encompasses the full \s-1SHA\s0 standard by
allowing partial-byte inputs.  This is accomplished through the \s-1BITS\s0
option (\fI\-0\fR).  The following example computes the \s-1SHA\-224\s0 digest of
the 7\-bit message \fI0001100\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl \-e "print qq(0001100)" | shasum \-0 \-a 224
