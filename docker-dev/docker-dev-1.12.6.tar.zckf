    @abstract Set a trust cookie to be used for evaluating this certificate chain.
    @param trust A reference to a trust object.
    @param exceptions An exceptions cookie as returned by a call to
    SecTrustCopyExceptions() in the past.
    @result Upon calling SecTrustEvaluate(), any failures that where present at the
    time the exceptions object was created are ignored, and instead of returning
    kSecTrustResultRecoverableTrustFailure, kSecTrustResultProceed will be returned
    (if the certificate for which exceptions was created matches the current leaf
    certificate).
    @result Returns true if the exceptions cookies was valid and matches the current
    leaf certificate, false otherwise.  This function will invalidate the existing
    trust result, requiring a subsequent evaluation for the newly-set exceptions.
    Note that this function returning true doesn't mean the caller can skip calling
    SecTrustEvaluate, as there may be new errors since the exceptions cookie was
    created (for example, a certificate may have subsequently expired.)
    @discussion Clients of this interface will need to establish the context of this
    exception to later decide when this exception cookie is to be used.
    Examples of this context would be the server we are connecting to, the ssid
    of the wireless network for which this cert is needed, the account for which
    this cert should be considered valid, and so on.

/*
 * Any certificate (cert) which resides in a keychain can have associated with 
 * it a set of Trust Settings. Trust Settings specify conditions in which a 
 * given cert can be trusted or explicitly distrusted. A "trusted" cert is
 * either a root (self-signed) cert that, when a cert chain verifies back to that
 * root, the entire cert chain is trusted; or a non-root cert that does not need 
 * to verify to a trusted root cert (which is normally the case when verifying a 
 * cert chain). An "explicitly distrusted" cert is one which will, when encountered 
 * during the evaluation of a cert chain, cause immediate and unconditional failure 
 * of the verify operation. 
 * 
 * Trust Settings are configurable by the user; they can apply on three levels
 * (called domains):
 *
 * -- Per-user.
 * -- Locally administered, system-wide. Administrator privileges are required
 *    to make changes to this domain.
 * -- System. These Trust Settings are immutable and comprise the set of trusted
 *    root certificates supplied in Mac OS X. 
 *
 * Per-user Trust Settings override locally administered Trust Settings, which 
 * in turn override the System Trust Settings. 
 *
 * Each cert's Trust Settings are expressed as a CFArray which includes any 
 * number (including zero) of CFDictionaries, each of which comprises one set of
 * Usage Constraints. Each Usage Constraints dictionary contains zero or one of 
 * each the following components:
 *
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsPolicy		value = SecPolicyRef
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsApplication	value = SecTrustedApplicationRef
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsPolicyString	value = CFString, policy-specific
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsKeyUsage		value = CFNumber, an SInt32 key usage
 * 
 * A given Usage Constraints dictionary applies to a given cert if *all* of the 
 * usage constraint components specified in the dictionary match the usage of 
 * the cert being evaluated; when this occurs, the value of the 
 * kSecTrustSettingsResult entry in the dictionary, shown below, is the effective
 * trust setting for the cert. 
 *
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsResult		value = CFNumber, an SInt32 SecTrustSettingsResult
 *
 * The overall Trust Settings of a given cert are the sum of all such Usage 
 * Constraints CFDictionaries: Trust Settings for a given usage apply if *any* 
 * of the CFDictionaries in the cert's Trust Settings array satisfies
 * the specified usage. Thus, when a cert has multiple Usage Constraints 
 * dictionaries in its Trust Settings array, the overall Trust Settings
 * for the cert are
 *
 * (Usage Constraint 0 component 0 AND Usage Constraint 0 component 1 ...)
 *     -- OR --
 * (Usage Constraint 1 component 0 AND Usage Constraint 1 component 1 ...)
 *     -- OR --
 * ...
 *
 * Notes on the various Usage Constraints components:
 *
 * kSecTrustSettingsPolicy			Specifies a cert verification policy, e.g., SSL, 
 *									SMIME, etc.
 * kSecTrustSettingsApplication 	Specifies the application performing the cert 
 *									verification.
 * kSecTrustSettingsPolicyString 	Policy-specific. For the SMIME policy, this is 
 *									an email address. 
 *									For the SSL policy, this is a host name.
 * kSecTrustSettingsKeyUsage		A bitfield indicating key operations (sign, 
 *									encrypt, etc.) for which this Usage Constraint 
 *									apply. Values are defined below as the 
 *									SecTrustSettingsKeyUsage enum. 
 * kSecTrustSettingsResult			The resulting trust value. If not present this has a
 *									default of kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustRoot, meaning 
 *								 	"trust this root cert". Other legal values are:
 *									kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustAsRoot : trust non-root
 *										cert as if it were a trusted root. 
 *									kSecTrustSettingsResultDeny : explicitly distrust this
 *										cert. 
 *									kSecTrustSettingsResultUnspecified : neither trust nor
 *										distrust; can be used to specify an "Allowed error" 
 *										(see below) without assigning trust to a specific 
 *										cert. 
 *
 * Another optional component in a Usage Constraints dictionary is a CSSM_RETURN
 * which, if encountered during certificate verification, is ignored for that
 * cert. These "allowed error" values are constrained by Usage Constraints as
 * described above; a Usage Constraint dictionary with no constraints but with
 * an Allowed Error value causes that error to always be allowed when the cert
 * is being evaluated.
 *
 * The "allowed error" entry in a Usage Constraints dictionary is formatted 
 * as follows:
 * 
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsAllowedError	value = CFNumber, an SInt32 CSSM_RETURN 
 *
 * Note that if kSecTrustSettingsResult value of kSecTrustSettingsResultUnspecified
 * is *not* present for a Usage Constraints dictionary with no Usage 
 * Constraints, the default of kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustRoot is assumed. To 
 * specify a kSecTrustSettingsAllowedError without explicitly trusting (or 
 * distrusting) the associated cert, specify kSecTrustSettingsResultUnspecified 
 * for the kSecTrustSettingsResult component. 
 *
 * Note that an empty Trust Settings array means "always trust this cert, 
 * with a resulting kSecTrustSettingsResult of kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustRoot". 
 * An empty Trust Settings array is definitely not the same as *no* Trust 
 * Settings, which means "this cert must be verified to a known trusted cert". 
 *
 * Note the distinction between kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustRoot and
 * kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustAsRoot; the former can only be applied to 
 * root (self-signed) certs; the latter can only be applied to non-root 
 * certs. This also means that an empty TrustSettings array for a non-root
 * cert is invalid, since the default value for kSecTrustSettingsResult is
 * kSecTrustSettingsResultTrustRoot, which is invalid for a non-root cert. 
 *
 * Authentication
 * --------------
 * 
 * When making changes to the per-user Trust Settings, the user will be 
 * prompted with an alert panel asking for authentication via user name a 
 * password (or other credentials normally used for login). This means 
 * that it is not possible to modify per-user Trust Settings when not 
 * running in a GUI environment (i.e. the user is not logged in via 
 * Loginwindow). 
 * 
 * When making changes to the system-wide Trust Settings, the user will be 
 * prompted with an alert panel asking for an administrator's name and 
 * password, unless the calling process is running as root in which case
 * no futher authentication is needed.

 * This file describes the public API for an implementation of the
 * Secure Socket Layer, V. 3.0, Transport Layer Security, V. 1.0 to V. 1.2
 * and Datagram Transport Layer Security V. 1.0
 *
 * There are no transport layer dependencies in this library;
 * it can be used with sockets, Open Transport, etc. Applications using
 * this library provide callback functions which do the actual I/O
 * on underlying network connections. Applications are also responsible
 * for setting up raw network connections; the application passes in
 * an opaque reference to the underlying (connected) entity at the
 * start of an SSL session in the form of an SSLConnectionRef.
 *
 * Some terminology:
 *
 * A "client" is the initiator of an SSL Session. The canonical example
 * of a client is a web browser, when it's talking to an https URL.
 *
 * A "server" is an entity which accepts requests for SSL sessions made
 * by clients. E.g., a secure web server.

 * An "SSL Session", or "session", is bounded by calls to SSLHandshake()
 * and SSLClose(). An "Active session" is in some state between these
 * two calls, inclusive.
 *
 * An SSL Session Context, or SSLContextRef, is an opaque reference in this
 * library to the state associated with one session. A SSLContextRef cannot
 * be reused for multiple sessions.

/*
 * GeneralName, used in AuthorityKeyID, SubjectAltName, and 
 * IssuerAltName. 
 *
 * For now, we just provide explicit support for the types which are
 * represented as IA5Strings, OIDs, and octet strings. Constructed types
 * such as EDIPartyName and x400Address are not explicitly handled
 * right now and must be encoded and decoded by the caller. (See exception
 * for Name and OtherName, below). In those cases the CE_GeneralName.name.Data field 
 * represents the BER contents octets; CE_GeneralName.name.Length is the 
 * length of the contents; the tag of the field is not needed - the BER 
 * encoding uses context-specific implicit tagging. The berEncoded field 
 * is set to CSSM_TRUE in these case. Simple types have berEncoded = CSSM_FALSE. 
 *
 * In the case of a GeneralName in the form of a Name, we parse the Name
 * into a CSSM_X509_NAME and place a pointer to the CSSM_X509_NAME in the
 * CE_GeneralName.name.Data field. CE_GeneralName.name.Length is set to 
 * sizeof(CSSM_X509_NAME). In this case berEncoded is false. 
 *
 * In the case of a GeneralName in the form of a OtherName, we parse the fields
 * into a CE_OtherName and place a pointer to the CE_OtherName in the
 * CE_GeneralName.name.Data field. CE_GeneralName.name.Length is set to 
 * sizeof(CE_OtherName). In this case berEncoded is false.

    @discussion  SFAuthorizationPluginView provides AuthorizationPlugin writers with an easy way to provide a user interface for their AuthorizationPlugin without having to duplicate the standard authentication dialog or the login window dialog.  This class was designed to be subclassed by the AuthorizationPlugin writer.  The following methods were designed to be overridden: buttonPressed:, didActivate, willActivateWithUser:, didDeactivate, firstKeyView, firstResponder, lastKeyView, setEnabled:, and viewForType:.  In order to display the user interface, the AuthorizationPlugin should create an instance of your subclass and then call displayView.  That will cause the appropriate dialog to be displayed and when credentials are needed, the overridden methods will be called in order to display the NSView provided by the subclass.

Note that you'll have to call updateStatus: to set the lock icon to its initial state. Changes to the current state as well as the startup state (after the initial updateStatus) are communicated to the delegate.  Implementing any of the following is optional):
    <ul>
      <li>authorized: changed to unlocked
      <li>deauthorized: changed to locked
      <li>shouldDeauthorize: when a user wants to lock, the delegates can react to this before it happens and avoid it by returning NO.
      <li>cancelAuthorization: the user cancelled authorization.
    </ul> 
Calls to updateStatus: return YES if in the unlocked state, NO otherwise. Note that when committing changes or performing actions, authorization has to be checked again before going ahead with it. The default behavior of this view is to pre-authorize rights, if this is not possible it will unlock and wait for authorization to be checked when explicitly required. For handing the SFAuthorization (authorization:) to another process it's NSCoder support can be used.

 * If the job is already installed, success is returned.
 *
 * In order to use this function the following requirements must be met:
 *
 * 1.	The calling application and target executable tool must both be signed.
 * 
 * 2.	The calling application's Info.plist must include a
 *		"SMPrivilegedExecutables" dictionary of strings. Each string is a
 *		textual representation of a code signing requirement used to determine
 *		whether the application owns the privileged tool once installed (i.e. in
 *		order for subsequent versions to update the installed version).
 *
 *		Each key of SMPrivilegedExecutables is a reverse-DNS label for the helper
 *		tool (must be globally unique).
 *
 * 3.	The helper tool must have an embedded Info.plist containing an 
 *		"SMAuthorizedClients" array of strings. Each string is a textual 
 *		representation of a code signing requirement describing a client which 
 *		is allowed to add and remove the tool.
 *
 * 4.	The helper tool must have an embedded launchd plist. The only required 
 *		key in this plist is the Label key. When the launchd plist is extracted 
 *		and written to disk, the key for ProgramArguments will be set to an 
 *		array of 1 element pointing to a standard location. You cannot specify 
 *		your own Program or ProgramArguments, so do not rely on custom command 
 *		line arguments being passed to your tool. Pass any parameters via IPC.
 *		This plist must be embedded in the __TEXT,__launchd_plist section of the
 *		binary.
 *
 *		A property list may be embedded in an executable at link-time with the
 *		-sectcreate linker flag.
 *
 * 5.	The helper tool must reside in the Contents/Library/LaunchServices 
 *		directory inside the application bundle, and its name must be its 
 *		launchd job label. So if your launchd job label is 
 *		"com.apple.Mail.helper", this must be the name of the tool in your 
 *		application bundle.
 * 
 * @param domain
 * The job's domain. Passing any value other than {@link kSMDomainSystemLaunchd}
 * will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * @param executableLabel
 * The label of the privileged executable to install. This label must be one of
 * the keys found in the SMPrivilegedExecutables dictionary in the application's
 * Info.plist.
 *
 * @param auth
 * An authorization reference containing the 
 * {@link kSMRightBlessPrivilegedHelper} right.
 *
 * @param outError
 * Upon unsuccessful return, a new CFError object describing the error.  Upon 
 * successful return, this argument is set to NULL.  This argument may be NULL. 
 * It is the responsibility of the application to release the error reference.
 *
 * @result
 * True if the helper tool was successfully bootstrapped, otherwise false.
 *
 * @discussion
 * SMJobBless submits the executable for the given label as a launchd job.  This
 * routine obviates the need for a setuid helper invoked via
 * AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges() in order to install a launchd plist.

 Sprites display textured rectangles in the SpriteKit scene graph.
 
 A Sprite as defined in this Framework is a textured and colored rectangle. It is a quick and easy way to display 2D images on screen and includes the basic components needed to allow many of these to interact on screen at once.
 
 A SpriteNode is a node that displays a Sprite. As it is a Node it can be transformed, be included as a child in another node and have child nodes of its own.

/* These are the entities which are supported by the client.  These are not necessarily the
   entities that *will* be synchronized by a client - a phone might be capable of synchronizing
   both contacts and calendars but the user has chosen (via UI in iSync or on the phone) to
   synchronize only contacts, for example.  A client should inform the engine that it will not be
   synchronizing an entity using -setEnabled:forEntityNames:.  It is not strictly required, but
   it allows the engine to do a better job of managing which clients can push the Truth for a
   specific entity.  It is a GOOD IDEA to do that.

   This list of entities is used by the sync engine to maintain a set of databases about the client.
   These databases contain the meta-information needed to synchronize the client properly and when
   an entity is removed from this list, the engine cleans up the associated state.  If the record
   type is later added back, it appears to the engine as if the client were syncing it for the
   first time and so must be refresh synced.

   It is important to understand the implications of this.  Consider the case of calendars on a phone
   which does not support recurrences, requiring the client manually expand the recurrence in to a
   series of events.  If, in response to the user disabling a data class in the UI, the client
   removes the calendar entities from this list and then later adds them back, the engine will
   refresh sync the calendars with the phone.  The expanded recurrences will then erroneously be
   merged in to the user's data.  The user would be better served if the client, instead, disabled
   the entities using -setEnabled:forEntityNames:.

   The list is built from the information provided when the client was registered.  The information
   can be provided directly by the client or the client can specify a description file containing
   the info.  The engine will refresh this list if the contents of the description file change or
   if the client explicitly registers new information.  Changing the list of entities supported by
   a device may require some entities be slow synced on the next sync.  (It depends on the
   relationships between the new and old sets of entities.)  Newly added entities will be refresh
   synced. In this manner, conduits can easily evolve the properties and entities they synchronize
   without having to worry about when they need to slow sync to refresh their device with
   additional properties. */

   device's willingness to do so - that is left for the conduit to negotiate with the engine when
   it starts a sync session.  They are advisory methods only.

   For example, the iPod conduit will probably indicate that is can accept changes to contacts and
   calendars but will never provide changes to the same. */

   ISyncStatusRunning but -lastSyncDate will continue to return the date of the last sync.

   The engine will maintain this information for as long as a device supports a record type name
   (ie. the record type name is returned from -entityNames).  When a device stops supporting
   a record type, this information is erased from the engine's database.  Should the device later

   -supportedEntityNames).  Through the client's config UI, the user disables syncing calendars.
   The user must then be prevented from trying to push the Truth for contacts from this client.

/* Specifies that the receiver wants to synchronize with clients of the specified type (application,
   device, server or peer).  For example, Address Book might register to synchronize with all client
   types.  It will be given a chance to join a sync whenver any client synchronizes the Contacts
   entities.  .Mac might register to synchronize only with device types, so it can participate when a
   Palm of phone is synchronized.  The client will only be notified if it has entities in common with
   the client initiating the sync.

   A client may be notified in one of two ways.  It may specify the path of a tool or application which
   will be launched by the sync engine.  The tool will be passed four arguments on the command line:
   "--sync <client id> --entitynames <entity names>".  The entity names is a single string suitable for
   passing to -[NSString componentsSeparatedByString:@","].  If the tool wishes to sync any of these
   entities, it may create an ISyncSession to join the sync.  The tool is not limited to syncing only
   these entities, but it must sync at least one of them.  If the tool terminates without creating a
   sync session, the engine will assume the client does not want to participate in the sync.

   Alternatively, an observer object may be registered.  The sync engine will invoke the selector on the
   observer.  The selector should have the following signature

         -(void)client:(ISyncClient *)client mightWantToSyncEntityNames:(NSArray *)entityNames.

   If it wishes to join the sync, it must create an ISyncSession before returning from the method.  Only
   one observer per client per machine may be registered.  If an observer is registered in a different
   process, -setSyncAlertHandler:selector: will throw an exception.  An observer is automatically
   removed when its process exits, of course.

   You can register both a sync tool and an observer, but only one of the notification methods will be
   used.  If both a tool and an observer are registered, only the observer will be called.

   When a client creates a sync session, it specifies how long it is willing to wait to start syncing (the
   "before date" parameter).  The sync engine will wait at most that amount of time for a notified
   clients to join the sync.  If a notified client takes too long, the sync will proceed without it. */
