0()\fR method is a scalar reference.
.PP
Second, we create a new tied hash each time the hash syntax is used.
This allows us not to worry about a possibility of a reference loop,
which would lead to a memory leak.
.PP
Both these problems can be cured.  Say, if we want to overload hash
dereference on a reference to an object which is \fIimplemented\fR as a
hash itself, the only problem one has to circumvent is how to access
this \fIactual\fR hash (as opposed to the \fIvirtual\fR hash exhibited by the
overloaded dereference operator).  Here is one possible fetching routine:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  sub access_hash {
\&    my ($self, $key) = (shift, shift);
\&    my $class = ref $self;
\&    bless $self, \*(Aqoverload::dummy\*(Aq; # Disable overloading of %{}
\&    my $out = $self\->{$key};
\&    bless $self, $class;        # Restore overloading
\&    $out;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
To remove creation of the tied hash on each access, one may an extra
level of indirection which allows a non-circular structure of references:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  package two_refs1;
\&  use overload \*(Aq%{}\*(Aq => sub { ${shift()}\->[1] },
\&               \*(Aq@{}\*(Aq => sub { ${shift()}\->[0] };
\&  sub new {
\&    my $p = shift;
\&    my $a = [@_];
\&    my %h;
\&    tie %h, $p, $a;
\&    bless \e [$a, \e%h], $p;
\&  }
\&  sub gethash {
\&    my %h;
\&    my $self = shift;
\&    tie %h, ref $self, $self;
\&    \e%h;
\&  }
\&
\&  sub TIEHASH { my $p = shift; bless \e shift, $p }
\&  my %fields;
\&  my $i = 0;
\&  $fields{$_} = $i++ foreach qw{zero one two three};
\&  sub STORE {
\&    my $a = ${shift()};
\&    my $key = $fields{shift()};
\&    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
\&    $a\->[$key] = shift;
\&  }
\&  sub FETCH {
\&    my $a = ${shift()};
\&    my $key = $fields{shift()};
\&    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
\&    $a\->[$key];
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Now if \f(CW$baz\fR is overloaded like this, then \f(CW$baz\fR is a reference to a
reference to the intermediate array, which keeps a reference to an
actual array, and the access hash.  The \fItie()\fRing object for the access
hash is a reference to a reference to the actual array, so
.IP "\(bu" 4
There are no loops of references.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Both \*(L"objects\*(R" which are blessed into the class \f(CW\*(C`two_refs1\*(C'\fR are
references to a reference to an array, thus references to a \fIscalar\fR.
Thus the accessor expression \f(CW\*(C`$$foo\->[$ind]\*(C'\fR involves no
overloaded operations.
.SS "Symbolic Calculator"
.IX Subsection "Symbolic Calculator"
Put this in \fIsymbolic.pm\fR in your Perl library directory:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package symbolic;             # Primitive symbolic calculator
\&  use overload nomethod => \e&wrap;
\&
\&  sub new { shift; bless [\*(Aqn\*(Aq, @_] }
\&  sub wrap {
\&    my ($obj, $other, $inv, $meth) = @_;
\&    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;
\&    bless [$meth, $obj, $other];
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
This module is very unusual as overloaded modules go: it does not
provide any usual overloaded operators, instead it provides an
implementation for "\f(CW\*(C`nomethod\*(C'\fR".  In this example the \f(CW\*(C`nomethod\*(C'\fR
subroutine returns an object which encapsulates operations done over
the objects: \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\->new(3)\*(C'\fR contains \f(CW\*(C`[\*(Aqn\*(Aq, 3]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`2 +
symbolic\->new(3)\*(C'\fR contains \f(CW\*(C`[\*(Aq+\*(Aq, 2, [\*(Aqn\*(Aq, 3]]\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Here is an example of the script which \*(L"calculates\*(R" the side of
circumscribed octagon using the above package:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  require symbolic;
\&  my $iter = 1;                 # 2**($iter+2) = 8
\&  my $side = symbolic\->new(1);
\&  my $cnt = $iter;
\&
\&  while ($cnt\-\-) {
\&    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) \- 1)/$side;
\&  }
\&  print "OK\en";
.Ve
.PP
The value of \f(CW$side\fR is
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  [\*(Aq/\*(Aq, [\*(Aq\-\*(Aq, [\*(Aqsqrt\*(Aq, [\*(Aq+\*(Aq, 1, [\*(Aq**\*(Aq, [\*(Aqn\*(Aq, 1], 2]],
\&                       undef], 1], [\*(Aqn\*(Aq, 1]]
.Ve
.PP
Note that while we obtained this value using a nice little script,
there is no simple way to \fIuse\fR this value.  In fact this value may
be inspected in debugger (see perldebug), but only if
\&\f(CW\*(C`bareStringify\*(C'\fR \fBO\fRption is set, and not via \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
If one attempts to print this value, then the overloaded operator
\&\f(CW""\fR will be called, which will call \f(CW\*(C`nomethod\*(C'\fR operator.  The
result of this operator will be stringified again, but this result is
again of type \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\*(C'\fR, which will lead to an infinite loop.
.PP
Add a pretty-printer method to the module \fIsymbolic.pm\fR:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  sub pretty {
\&    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
\&    $a = \*(Aqu\*(Aq unless defined $a;
\&    $b = \*(Aqu\*(Aq unless defined $b;
\&    $a = $a\->pretty if ref $a;
\&    $b = $b\->pretty if ref $b;
\&    "[$meth $a $b]";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Now one can finish the script by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print "side = ", $side\->pretty, "\en";
.Ve
.PP
The method \f(CW\*(C`pretty\*(C'\fR is doing object-to-string conversion, so it
is natural to overload the operator \f(CW""\fR using this method.  However,
inside such a method it is not necessary to pretty-print the
\&\fIcomponents\fR \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR of an object.  In the above subroutine
\&\f(CW"[$meth $a $b]"\fR is a catenation of some strings and components \f(CW$a\fR
and \f(CW$b\fR.  If these components use overloading, the catenation operator
will look for an overloaded operator \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR; if not present, it will
look for an overloaded operator \f(CW""\fR.  Thus it is enough to use
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  use overload nomethod => \e&wrap, \*(Aq""\*(Aq => \e&str;
\&  sub str {
\&    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
\&    $a = \*(Aqu\*(Aq unless defined $a;
\&    $b = \*(Aqu\*(Aq unless defined $b;
\&    "[$meth $a $b]";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Now one can change the last line of the script to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print "side = $side\en";
.Ve
.PP
which outputs
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  side = [/ [\- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1 u] 2]] u] 1] [n 1 u]]
.Ve
.PP
and one can inspect the value in debugger using all the possible
methods.
.PP
Something is still amiss: consider the loop variable \f(CW$cnt\fR of the
script.  It was a number, not an object.  We cannot make this value of
type \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\*(C'\fR, since then the loop will not terminate.
.PP
Indeed, to terminate the cycle, the \f(CW$cnt\fR should become false.
However, the operator \f(CW\*(C`bool\*(C'\fR for checking falsity is overloaded (this
time via overloaded \f(CW""\fR), and returns a long string, thus any object
of type \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\*(C'\fR is true.  To overcome this, we need a way to
compare an object to 0.  In fact, it is easier to write a numeric
conversion routine.
.PP
Here is the text of \fIsymbolic.pm\fR with such a routine added (and
slightly modified \fIstr()\fR):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  package symbolic;             # Primitive symbolic calculator
\&  use overload
\&    nomethod => \e&wrap, \*(Aq""\*(Aq => \e&str, \*(Aq0+\*(Aq => \e&num;
\&
\&  sub new { shift; bless [\*(Aqn\*(Aq, @_] }
\&  sub wrap {
\&    my ($obj, $other, $inv, $meth) = @_;
\&    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;

\&      "[$meth $a $b]";
\&    } else {
\&      "[$meth $a]";
\&    }
\&  }
\&  my %subr = ( n => sub {$_[0]},
\&               sqrt => sub {sqrt $_[0]},
\&               \*(Aq\-\*(Aq => sub {shift() \- shift()},

\&             );
\&  sub num {
\&    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
\&    my $subr = $subr{$meth}
\&      or die "Do not know how to ($meth) in symbolic";
\&    $a = $a\->num if ref $a eq _\|_PACKAGE_\|_;
\&    $b = $b\->num if ref $b eq _\|_PACKAGE_\|_;
\&    $subr\->($a,$b);

.Ve
.PP
All the work of numeric conversion is done in \f(CW%subr\fR and \fInum()\fR.  Of
course, \f(CW%subr\fR is not complete, it contains only operators used in the
example below.  Here is the extra-credit question: why do we need an
explicit recursion in \fInum()\fR?  (Answer is at the end of this section.)
.PP
Use this module like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  require symbolic;
\&  my $iter = symbolic\->new(2);  # 16\-gon
\&  my $side = symbolic\->new(1);
\&  my $cnt = $iter;
\&
\&  while ($cnt) {
\&    $cnt = $cnt \- 1;            # Mutator \*(Aq\-\-\*(Aq not implemented
\&    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) \- 1)/$side;
\&  }
\&  printf "%s=%f\en", $side, $side;
\&  printf "pi=%f\en", $side*(2**($iter+2));
.Ve
.PP
It prints (without so many line breaks)
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  [/ [\- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [/ [\- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1]
\&                          [n 1]] 2]]] 1]
\&     [/ [\- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1] [n 1]]]=0.198912
\&  pi=3.182598
.Ve
.PP
The above module is very primitive.  It does not implement
mutator methods (\f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-=\*(C'\fR and so on), does not do deep copying
(not required without mutators!), and implements only those arithmetic
operations which are used in the example.
.PP
To implement most arithmetic operations is easy; one should just use
the tables of operations, and change the code which fills \f(CW%subr\fR to
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  my %subr = ( \*(Aqn\*(Aq => sub {$_[0]} );
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", $overload::ops{with_assign}) {
\&    $subr{$op} = $subr{"$op="} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
\&  }
\&  my @bins = qw(binary 3way_comparison num_comparison str_comparison);
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{ @bins }") {
\&    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
\&  }
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{qw(unary func)}") {
\&    print "defining \*(Aq$op\*(Aq\en";
\&    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {$op shift()}";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Since subroutines implementing assignment operators are not required
to modify their operands (see \*(L"Overloadable Operations\*(R" above),
we do not need anything special to make \f(CW\*(C`+=\*(C'\fR and friends work,
besides adding these operators to \f(CW%subr\fR and defining a copy
constructor (needed since Perl has no way to know that the
implementation of \f(CW\*(Aq+=\*(Aq\fR does not mutate the argument \-
see \*(L"Copy Constructor\*(R").
.PP
To implement a copy constructor, add \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq=\*(Aq => \e&cpy\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`use overload\*(C'\fR
line, and code (this code assumes that mutators change things one level
deep only, so recursive copying is not needed):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub cpy {
\&    my $self = shift;
\&    bless [@$self], ref $self;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
To make \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR work, we need to implement actual mutators,
either directly, or in \f(CW\*(C`nomethod\*(C'\fR.  We continue to do things inside
\&\f(CW\*(C`nomethod\*(C'\fR, thus add
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    if ($meth eq \*(Aq++\*(Aq or $meth eq \*(Aq\-\-\*(Aq) {
\&      @$obj = ($meth, (bless [@$obj]), 1); # Avoid circular reference
\&      return $obj;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
after the first line of \fIwrap()\fR.  This is not a most effective
implementation, one may consider
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub inc { $_[0] = bless [\*(Aq++\*(Aq, shift, 1]; }
.Ve
.PP
instead.
.PP
As a final remark, note that one can fill \f(CW%subr\fR by
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  my %subr = ( \*(Aqn\*(Aq => sub {$_[0]} );
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", $overload::ops{with_assign}) {
\&    $subr{$op} = $subr{"$op="} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
\&  }
\&  my @bins = qw(binary 3way_comparison num_comparison str_comparison);
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{ @bins }") {
\&    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
\&  }
\&  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{qw(unary func)}") {
\&    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {$op shift()}";
\&  }
\&  $subr{\*(Aq++\*(Aq} = $subr{\*(Aq+\*(Aq};
\&  $subr{\*(Aq\-\-\*(Aq} = $subr{\*(Aq\-\*(Aq};
.Ve
.PP
This finishes implementation of a primitive symbolic calculator in
50 lines of Perl code.  Since the numeric values of subexpressions
are not cached, the calculator is very slow.
.PP
Here is the answer for the exercise: In the case of \fIstr()\fR, we need no
explicit recursion since the overloaded \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR\-operator will fall back
to an existing overloaded operator \f(CW""\fR.  Overloaded arithmetic
operators \fIdo not\fR fall back to numeric conversion if \f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR is
not explicitly requested.  Thus without an explicit recursion \fInum()\fR
would convert \f(CW\*(C`[\*(Aq+\*(Aq, $a, $b]\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`$a + $b\*(C'\fR, which would just rebuild
the argument of \fInum()\fR.
.PP
If you wonder why defaults for conversion are different for \fIstr()\fR and
\&\fInum()\fR, note how easy it was to write the symbolic calculator.  This
simplicity is due to an appropriate choice of defaults.  One extra
note: due to the explicit recursion \fInum()\fR is more fragile than \fIsym()\fR:
we need to explicitly check for the type of \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR.  If components
\&\f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR happen to be of some related type, this may lead to problems.
.SS "\fIReally\fP Symbolic Calculator"
.IX Subsection "Really Symbolic Calculator"
One may wonder why we call the above calculator symbolic.  The reason
is that the actual calculation of the value of expression is postponed
until the value is \fIused\fR.
.PP
To see it in action, add a method
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  sub STORE {
\&    my $obj = shift;
\&    $#$obj = 1;
\&    @$obj\->[0,1] = (\*(Aq=\*(Aq, shift);
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
to the package \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\*(C'\fR.  After this change one can do
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $a = symbolic\->new(3);
\&  my $b = symbolic\->new(4);
\&  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);
.Ve
.PP
and the numeric value of \f(CW$c\fR becomes 5.  However, after calling
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $a\->STORE(12);  $b\->STORE(5);
.Ve
.PP
the numeric value of \f(CW$c\fR becomes 13.  There is no doubt now that the module
symbolic provides a \fIsymbolic\fR calculator indeed.
.PP
To hide the rough edges under the hood, provide a \fItie()\fRd interface to the
package \f(CW\*(C`symbolic\*(C'\fR.  Add methods
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  sub TIESCALAR { my $pack = shift; $pack\->new(@_) }
\&  sub FETCH { shift }
\&  sub nop {  }          # Around a bug
.Ve
.PP
(the bug, fixed in Perl 5.14, is described in \*(L"\s-1BUGS\*(R"\s0).  One can use this
new interface as
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  tie $a, \*(Aqsymbolic\*(Aq, 3;
\&  tie $b, \*(Aqsymbolic\*(Aq, 4;
\&  $a\->nop;  $b\->nop;    # Around a bug
\&
\&  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);
.Ve
.PP
Now numeric value of \f(CW$c\fR is 5.  After \f(CW\*(C`$a = 12; $b = 5\*(C'\fR the numeric value
of \f(CW$c\fR becomes 13.  To insulate the user of the module add a method
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub vars { my $p = shift; tie($_, $p), $_\->nop foreach @_; }
.Ve
.PP
Now
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my ($a, $b);
\&  symbolic\->vars($a, $b);
\&  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);
\&
\&  $a = 3; $b = 4;
\&  printf "c5  %s=%f\en", $c, $c;
\&
\&  $a = 12; $b = 5;
\&  printf "c13  %s=%f\en", $c, $c;

shows that the numeric value of \f(CW$c\fR follows changes to the values of \f(CW$a\fR

Using the \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR command of Perl debugger (see perldebug) one can
deduce which operations are overloaded (and which ancestor triggers
this overloading).  Say, if \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR is overloaded, then the method \f(CW\*(C`(eq\*(C'\fR
is shown by debugger.  The method \f(CW\*(C`()\*(C'\fR corresponds to the \f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR
key (in fact a presence of this method shows that this package has
overloading enabled, and it is what is used by the \f(CW\*(C`Overloaded\*(C'\fR
function of module \f(CW\*(C`overload\*(C'\fR).

The module might issue the following warnings:

.SH "BUGS AND PITFALLS"
.IX Header "BUGS AND PITFALLS"
.IP "\(bu" 4
A pitfall when fallback is \s-1TRUE\s0 and Perl resorts to a built-in
implementation of an operator is that some operators have more
than one semantic, for example \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        use overload \*(Aq0+\*(Aq => sub { $_[0]\->{n}; },
\&            fallback => 1;
\&        my $x = bless { n => 4 }, "main";
\&        my $y = bless { n => 8 }, "main";
\&        print $x | $y, "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
You might expect this to output \*(L"12\*(R".
In fact, it prints \*(L"<\*(R": the \s-1ASCII\s0 result of treating \*(L"|\*(R"
as a bitwise string operator \- that is, the result of treating
the operands as the strings \*(L"4\*(R" and \*(L"8\*(R" rather than numbers.
The fact that numify (\f(CW\*(C`0+\*(C'\fR) is implemented but stringify
(\f(CW""\fR) isn't makes no difference since the latter is simply
autogenerated from the former.
.Sp
The only way to change this is to provide your own subroutine
for \f(CW\*(Aq|\*(Aq\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Magic autogeneration increases the potential for inadvertently
creating self-referential structures.
Currently Perl will not free self-referential
structures until cycles are explicitly broken.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use overload \*(Aq+\*(Aq => \*(Aqadd\*(Aq;
\&    sub add { bless [ \e$_[0], \e$_[1] ] };
.Ve
.Sp
is asking for trouble, since
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $obj += $y;
.Ve
.Sp
will effectively become
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $obj = add($obj, $y, undef);
.Ve
.Sp
with the same result as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $obj = [\e$obj, \e$foo];
.Ve
.Sp
Even if no \fIexplicit\fR assignment-variants of operators are present in
the script, they may be generated by the optimizer.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    "obj = $obj\en"
.Ve
.Sp
may be optimized to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $tmp = \*(Aqobj = \*(Aq . $obj;  $tmp .= "\en";
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The symbol table is filled with names looking like line-noise.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This bug was fixed in Perl 5.18, but may still trip you up if you are using
older versions:
.Sp
For the purpose of inheritance every overloaded package behaves as if
\&\f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR is present (possibly undefined).  This may create
interesting effects if some package is not overloaded, but inherits
from two overloaded packages.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Before Perl 5.14, the relation between overloading and \fItie()\fRing was broken.
Overloading was triggered or not based on the \fIprevious\fR class of the
\&\fItie()\fRd variable.
.Sp
This happened because the presence of overloading was checked
too early, before any \fItie()\fRd access was attempted.  If the
class of the value \s-1\fIFETCH\s0()\fRed from the tied variable does not
change, a simple workaround for code that is to run on older Perl
versions is to access the value (via \f(CW\*(C`() = $foo\*(C'\fR or some such)
immediately after \fItie()\fRing, so that after this call the \fIprevious\fR class
coincides with the current one.

.SH NAME
\fBoverlay\fR,
\fBoverwrite\fR,
\fBcopywin\fR - overlay and manipulate overlapped \fBcurses\fR windows
.ad
.hy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint overlay(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);\fR
.br
\fBint overwrite(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);\fR
.br
\fBint copywin(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin, int sminrow,\fR
      \fBint smincol, int dminrow, int dmincol, int dmaxrow,\fR
      \fBint dmaxcol, int overlay);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR routines overlay \fIsrcwin\fR on
top of \fIdstwin\fR.  \fIscrwin\fR and \fIdstwin\fR are not required
to be the same size; only text where the two windows overlap is
copied.  The difference is that \fBoverlay\fR is non-destructive
(blanks are not copied) whereas \fBoverwrite\fR is destructive.
.PP
The \fBcopywin\fR routine provides a finer granularity of control over the
\fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR routines.  Like in the \fBprefresh\fR
routine, a rectangle is specified in the destination window, (\fIdminrow\fR,
\fIdmincol\fR) and (\fIdmaxrow\fR, \fIdmaxcol\fR), and the upper-left-corner
coordinates of the source window, (\fIsminrow\fR, \fIsmincol\fR).  If the
argument \fIoverlay\fR is \fBtrue\fR, then copying is non-destructive, as in
\fBoverlay\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure, and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
\fBcopywin\fP,
\fBoverlay\fP and \fBoverwrite\fP return an error
if either of the window pointers are null, or
if some part of the window would be placed off-screen.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions (adding the const
qualifiers).  It further specifies their behavior in the presence of characters
with multibyte renditions (not yet supported in this implementation).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
\fBcurses\fR support color attributes on terminals with that capability.  To
use these routines \fBstart_color\fR must be called, usually right after
\fBinitscr\fR.  Colors are always used in pairs (referred to as color-pairs).
A color-pair consists of a foreground color (for characters) and a background
color (for the blank field on which the characters are displayed).  A
programmer initializes a color-pair with the routine \fBinit_pair\fR.  After it
has been initialized, \fBCOLOR_PAIR\fR(\fIn\fR), a macro defined in
\fB<curses.h>\fR, can be used as a new video attribute.
.PP
If a terminal is capable of redefining colors, the programmer can use the
routine \fBinit_color\fR to change the definition of a color.  The routines
\fBhas_colors\fR and \fBcan_change_color\fR return \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR,
depending on whether the terminal has color capabilities and whether the
programmer can change the colors.  The routine \fBcolor_content\fR allows a
programmer to extract the amounts of red, green, and blue components in an
initialized color.  The routine \fBpair_content\fR allows a programmer to find
out how a given color-pair is currently defined.
.SS Routine Descriptions
The \fBstart_color\fR routine requires no arguments.  It must be
called if the programmer wants to use colors, and before any other
color manipulation routine is called.  It is good practice to call
this routine right after \fBinitscr\fR.  \fBstart_color\fR initializes
eight basic colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
and white), and two global variables, \fBCOLORS\fR and
\fBCOLOR_PAIRS\fR (respectively defining the maximum number of colors
and color-pairs the terminal can support).  It also restores the
colors on the terminal to the values they had when the terminal was
just turned on.
.PP
The \fBinit_pair\fR routine changes the definition of a color-pair.  It takes
three arguments: the number of the color-pair to be changed, the foreground
color number, and the background color number.
For portable applications:
.TP 5
-
The value of the first argument
must be between \fB1\fR and \fBCOLOR_PAIRS-1\fR.
.TP 5
-
The value of the second and
third arguments must be between 0 and \fBCOLORS\fR.
Color pair 0 is assumed to be white on black,
but is actually whatever the terminal implements before color is initialized.
It cannot be modified by the application.
.PP
If the color-pair was previously
initialized, the screen is refreshed and all occurrences of that color-pair
are changed to the new definition.
.PP
As an extension, ncurses allows you to set color pair 0 via
the \fBassume_default_colors\fR routine, or to specify the use of
default colors (color number \fB-1\fR) if you first invoke the
\fBuse_default_colors\fR routine.
.PP
The \fBinit_color\fR routine changes the definition of a color.  It takes four
arguments: the number of the color to be changed followed by three RGB values
(for the amounts of red, green, and blue components).  The value of the first
argument must be between \fB0\fR and \fBCOLORS\fR.  (See the section
\fBColors\fR for the default color index.)  Each of the last three arguments
must be a value between 0 and 1000.  When \fBinit_color\fR is used, all
occurrences of that color on the screen immediately change to the new
definition.
.PP
The \fBhas_colors\fR routine requires no arguments.  It returns \fBTRUE\fR if
the terminal can manipulate colors; otherwise, it returns \fBFALSE\fR.  This
routine facilitates writing terminal-independent programs.  For example, a
programmer can use it to decide whether to use color or some other video
attribute.
.PP
The \fBcan_change_color\fR routine requires no arguments.  It returns
\fBTRUE\fR if the terminal supports colors and can change their definitions;
other, it returns \fBFALSE\fR.  This routine facilitates writing
terminal-independent programs.
.PP
The \fBcolor_content\fR routine gives programmers a way to find the intensity
of the red, green, and blue (RGB) components in a color.  It requires four
arguments: the color number, and three addresses of \fBshort\fRs for storing
the information about the amounts of red, green, and blue components in the
given color.  The value of the first argument must be between 0 and
\fBCOLORS\fR.  The values that are stored at the addresses pointed to by the
last three arguments are between 0 (no component) and 1000 (maximum amount of
component).
.PP
The \fBpair_content\fR routine allows programmers to find out what colors a
given color-pair consists of.  It requires three arguments: the color-pair
number, and two addresses of \fBshort\fRs for storing the foreground and the
background color numbers.  The value of the first argument must be between 1
and \fBCOLOR_PAIRS-1\fR.  The values that are stored at the addresses pointed
to by the second and third arguments are between 0 and \fBCOLORS\fR.
.SS Colors
In \fB<curses.h>\fR the following macros are defined.  These are the default
colors.  \fBcurses\fR also assumes that \fBCOLOR_BLACK\fR is the default
background color for all terminals.
.PP
.nf
      \fBCOLOR_BLACK\fR
      \fBCOLOR_RED\fR
      \fBCOLOR_GREEN\fR
      \fBCOLOR_YELLOW\fR
      \fBCOLOR_BLUE\fR
      \fBCOLOR_MAGENTA\fR
      \fBCOLOR_CYAN\fR
      \fBCOLOR_WHITE\fR
.fi
.SH RETURN VALUE
The routines \fBcan_change_color()\fR and \fBhas_colors()\fR return \fBTRUE\fR
or \fBFALSE\fR.
.PP
All other routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
This implementation will return \fBERR\fR on attempts to
use color values outside the range 0 to COLORS-1
(except for the default colors extension),
or use color pairs outside the range 0 to COLOR_PAIR-1.
Color values used in \fBinit_color\fP must be in the range 0 to 1000.
An error is returned from all functions
if the terminal has not been initialized.
An error is returned from secondary functions such as \fBinit_pair\fP
if \fBstart_color\fP was not called.
.RS
.TP 5
\fBinit_color\fP
returns an error if the terminal does not support
this feature, e.g., if the \fIinitialize_color\fP capability is absent
from the terminal description.
.TP 5
\fBstart_color\fP
returns an error
If the color table cannot be allocated.
.RE
.SH NOTES
In the \fIncurses\fR implementation, there is a separate color activation flag,
color palette, color pairs table, and associated COLORS and COLOR_PAIRS counts
for each screen; the \fBstart_color\fR function only affects the current
screen.  The SVr4/XSI interface is not really designed with this in mind, and
historical implementations may use a single shared color palette.
.PP
Note that setting an implicit background color via a color pair affects only
character cells that a character write operation explicitly touches.  To change
the background color used when parts of a window are blanked by erasing or
scrolling operations, see \fBcurs_bkgd\fR(3X).
.PP
Several caveats apply on 386 and 486 machines with VGA-compatible graphics:
.TP 5
-
COLOR_YELLOW is actually brown.  To get yellow, use COLOR_YELLOW combined with
the \fBA_BOLD\fR attribute.
.TP 5
-
The A_BLINK attribute should in theory cause the background to go bright.  This
often fails to work, and even some cards for which it mostly works (such as the
Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing when you try to set a bright
"yellow" background (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).
.TP 5
-
Color RGB values are not settable.
.SH PORTABILITY
This implementation satisfies XSI Curses's minimum maximums
for \fBCOLORS\fR and \fBCOLOR_PAIRS\fR.
.PP
The \fBinit_pair\fP routine accepts negative values of foreground
and background color to support the \fBuse_default_colors\fP extension,
but only if that routine has been first invoked.
.PP
The assumption that \fBCOLOR_BLACK\fR is the default
background color for all terminals can be modified using the
\fBassume_default_colors\fP extension.
.PP
This implementation checks the pointers,
e.g., for the values returned by
\fBcolor_content\fP and \fBpair_content\fP,
and will treat those as optional parameters when null.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library abstracts a number
of common authentication-related operations and provides a framework
for dynamically loaded modules that implement these operations in
various ways.
.Ss Terminology
In PAM parlance, the application that uses PAM to authenticate a user
is the server, and is identified for configuration purposes by a
service name, which is often (but not necessarily) the program name.
.Pp
The user requesting authentication is called the applicant, while the
user (usually, root) charged with verifying his identity and granting
him the requested credentials is called the arbitrator.
.Pp
The sequence of operations the server goes through to authenticate a
user and perform whatever task he requested is a PAM transaction; the
context within which the server performs the requested task is called
a session.
.Pp
The functionality embodied by PAM is divided into six primitives
grouped into four facilities: authentication, account management,
session management and password management.
.Ss Conversation
The PAM library expects the application to provide a conversation
callback which it can use to communicate with the user.
Some modules may use specialized conversation functions to communicate
with special hardware such as cryptographic dongles or biometric
devices.
See
.Xr pam_conv 3
for details.
.Ss Initialization and Cleanup
The
.Fn pam_start
function initializes the PAM library and returns a handle which must
be provided in all subsequent function calls.
The transaction state is contained entirely within the structure
identified by this handle, so it is possible to conduct multiple
transactions in parallel.
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_end
function releases all resources associated with the specified context,
and can be called at any time to terminate a PAM transaction.
.Ss Storage
The
.Fn pam_set_item
and
.Fn pam_get_item
functions set and retrieve a number of predefined items, including the
service name, the names of the requesting and target users, the
conversation function, and prompts.
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_set_data
and
.Fn pam_get_data
functions manage named chunks of free-form data, generally used by
modules to store state from one invocation to another.
.Ss Authentication
There are two authentication primitives:
.Fn pam_authenticate
and
.Fn pam_setcred .
The former authenticates the user, while the latter manages his
credentials.
.Ss Account Management
The
.Fn pam_acct_mgmt
function enforces policies such as password expiry, account expiry,
time-of-day restrictions, and so forth.
.Ss Session Management
The
.Fn pam_open_session
and
.Fn pam_close_session
functions handle session setup and teardown.
.Ss Password Management
The
.Fn pam_chauthtok
function allows the server to change the user's password, either at
the user's request or because the password has expired.
.Ss Miscellaneous
The
.Fn pam_putenv ,
.Fn pam_getenv
and
.Fn pam_getenvlist
functions manage a private environment list in which modules can set
environment variables they want the server to export during the
session.
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_strerror
function returns a pointer to a string describing the specified PAM
error code.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.In security/pam_constants.h :
.Bl -tag -width 18n

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function attempts to authenticate the user
associated with the pam context specified by the
.Fa pamh
argument.
.Pp
The application is free to call
.Nm
as many times as it
wishes, but some modules may maintain an internal retry counter and
return
.Dv PAM_MAXTRIES
when it exceeds some preset or hardcoded limit.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument is the binary or of zero or more of the following
values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Dv PAM_SILENT
Do not emit any messages.
.It Dv PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
Fail if the user's authentication token is null.
.El
.Pp
If any other bits are set,
.Nm
will return
.Dv PAM_SYMBOL_ERR .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Bq Er PAM_ABORT
General failure.
.It Bq Er PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL

.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_conv
.Nd PAM conversation system
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpam
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In security/pam_appl.h
.Bd -literal
struct pam_message {
	int      msg_style;
	char    *msg;
};

struct pam_response {
	char    *resp;
	int      resp_retcode;
};

struct pam_conv {
	int     (*conv)(int, const struct pam_message **,
	    struct pam_response **, void *);
	void    *appdata_ptr;
};
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PAM library uses an application-defined callback to communicate
with the user.
This callback is specified by the
.Vt struct pam_conv
passed to
.Fn pam_start
at the start of the transaction.
It is also possible to set or change the conversation function at any
point during a PAM transaction by changing the value of the
.Dv PAM_CONV
item.
.Pp
The conversation function's first argument specifies the number of
messages (up to
.Dv PAM_NUM_MSG )
to process.
The second argument is a pointer to an array of pointers to
.Vt pam_message
structures containing the actual messages.
.Pp
Each message can have one of four types, specified by the
.Va msg_style
member of
.Vt struct pam_message :
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Dv PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF
Display a prompt and accept the user's response without echoing it to
the terminal.
This is commonly used for passwords.
.It Dv PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON
Display a prompt and accept the user's response, echoing it to the
terminal.
This is commonly used for login names and one-time passphrases.
.It Dv PAM_ERROR_MSG
Display an error message.
.It Dv PAM_TEXT_INFO
Display an informational message.
.El
.Pp
In each case, the prompt or message to display is pointed to by the
.Va msg
member of
.Vt struct pam_message .
It can be up to
.Dv PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE
characters long, including the terminating NUL.
.Pp
On success, the conversation function should allocate and fill a
contiguous array of
.Vt struct pam_response ,
one for each message that was passed in.
A pointer to the user's response to each message (or
.Dv NULL
in the case of informational or error messages) should be stored in
the
.Va resp
member of the corresponding
.Vt struct pam_response .
Each response can be up to
.Dv PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE
characters long, including the terminating NUL.
.Pp
The
.Va resp_retcode
member of
.Vt struct pam_response
is unused and should be set to zero.
.Pp
The conversation function should store a pointer to this array in the
location pointed to by its third argument.
It is the caller's responsibility to release both this array and the
responses themselves, using
.Xr free 3 .
It is the conversation function's responsibility to ensure that it is
legal to do so.
.Pp
The
.Va appdata_ptr
member of
.Vt struct pam_conv
is passed unmodified to the conversation function as its fourth and
final argument.
.Pp
On failure, the conversation function should release any resources it
has allocated, and return one of the predefined PAM error codes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The conversation function should return one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Bq Er PAM_BUF_ERR
Memory buffer error.
.It Bq Er PAM_CONV_ERR
Conversation failure.
.It Bq Er PAM_SUCCESS
Success.
.It Bq Er PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
System error.

The
.Nm
function returns the cached authentication token,
or prompts the user if no token is currently cached.
Either way, a pointer to the authentication token is stored in the
location pointed to by the
.Fa authtok
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa item
argument must have one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
Returns the current authentication token, or the new token
when changing authentication tokens.
.It Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
Returns the previous authentication token when changing
authentication tokens.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa prompt
argument specifies a prompt to use if no token is cached.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK_PROMPT
or
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK_PROMPT
item,
as appropriate, will be used.
If that item is also
.Dv NULL ,
a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
.Pp
If
.Fa item
is set to
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
and there is a non-null
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
item,
.Nm
will ask the user to confirm the new token by
retyping it.
If there is a mismatch,
.Nm
will return
.Dv PAM_TRY_AGAIN .
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The

The
.Nm
function returns the name of the target user, as
specified to
.Xr pam_start 3 .
If no user was specified, nor set using

Either way, a pointer to the user name is stored in the location
pointed to by the
.Fa user
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa prompt
argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is
cached.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Dv PAM_USER_PROMPT
will be used.
If that item is also
.Dv NULL ,
a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The

.SH DESCRIPTION
Panels are \fBcurses\fR(3X) windows with the added feature of
depth.  Panel functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure
the proper portions of each window and the curses \fBstdscr\fR window are
hidden or displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or removed.
The set of currently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The
\fBstdscr\fR window is beneath all panels, and is not considered part
of the stack.
.P
A window is associated with every panel. The panel routines enable
you to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a
panel at any desired location in the stack.
.P
Panel routines are a functional layer added to \fBcurses\fR(3X), make only
high-level curses calls, and work anywhere terminfo curses does.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B new_panel(win)
allocates  a  \fBPANEL\fR structure, associates it with
\fBwin\fR, places the panel on the top of the stack  (causes  it
to  be  displayed above any other panel) and returns a
pointer to the new panel.
.TP
.B update_panels()
refreshes the virtual screen to reflect the relations between the
panels in the stack, but does not call doupdate() to refresh the
physical screen.  Use this function and not wrefresh or wnoutrefresh.
update_panels() may be called more than once before a call to
doupdate(), but doupdate() is the function responsible for updating
the physical screen.
.TP
.B del_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the  stack and deallocates the
\fBPANEL\fR structure (but not its associated window).
.TP
.B hide_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the panel stack and thus hides it from
view. The \fBPANEL\fR structure is not lost, merely removed from the stack.
.TP
.B panel_hidden(pan)
returns TRUE if the panel is in the panel stack,
FALSE if it is not.
If the panel is a null pointer, return ERR.
.TP
.B show_panel(pan)
makes a hidden panel visible by placing it on top of the panels in the
panel stack. See COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B top_panel(pan)
puts the given visible panel on top of all panels in the stack.  See
COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B bottom_panel(pan)
puts panel at the bottom of all panels.
.TP
.B move_panel(pan,starty,startx)
moves the given panel window so that its upper-left corner is at
\fBstarty\fR, \fBstartx\fR.  It does not change the position of the
panel in the stack.  Be sure to use this function, not \fBmvwin()\fR,
to move a panel window.
.TP
.B replace_panel(pan,window)
replaces the current window of panel with \fBwindow\fR (useful, for
example if you want to resize a panel; if you're using \fBncurses\fR,
you can call \fBreplace_panel\fR on the output of \fBwresize\fR(3X)).
It does not change the position of the panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_above(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel above pan.  If the panel argument is
\fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the bottom panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_below(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If the panel argument
is \fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the top panel in the stack.
.TP
.B set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)
sets the panel's user pointer.
.TP
.B panel_userptr(pan)
returns the user pointer for a given panel.
.TP
.B panel_window(pan)
returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Each routine that returns a pointer returns \fBNULL\fR if an error
occurs. Each routine that returns an int value returns \fBOK\fR if it
executes successfully and \fBERR\fR if not.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Reasonable care has been taken to  ensure  compatibility
with  the  native  panel facility introduced in SVr3.2 (inspection of
the SVr4 manual pages suggests the programming interface is unchanged).
The \fBPANEL\fR data structures are merely  similar. The  programmer
is cautioned not to directly use \fBPANEL\fR fields.
.P
The functions \fBshow_panel()\fR and \fBtop_panel()\fR are identical
in this implementation, and work equally well with displayed or hidden
panels.  In the native System V implementation, \fBshow_panel()\fR is
intended for making a hidden panel visible (at the top of the stack)
and \fBtop_panel()\fR is intended for making an already-visible panel
move to the top of the stack. You are cautioned to use the correct
function to ensure compatibility with native panel libraries.
.SH NOTE
In your library list, libpanel.a should be before libncurses.a; that is,
you want to say `-lpanel -lncurses', not the other way around (which would
usually give a link-error).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Panels are \fBcurses\fR(3X) windows with the added feature of
depth.  Panel functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure
the proper portions of each window and the curses \fBstdscr\fR window are
hidden or displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or removed.
The set of currently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The
\fBstdscr\fR window is beneath all panels, and is not considered part
of the stack.
.P
A window is associated with every panel. The panel routines enable
you to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a
panel at any desired location in the stack.
.P
Panel routines are a functional layer added to \fBcurses\fR(3X), make only
high-level curses calls, and work anywhere terminfo curses does.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B new_panel(win)
allocates  a  \fBPANEL\fR structure, associates it with
\fBwin\fR, places the panel on the top of the stack  (causes  it
to  be  displayed above any other panel) and returns a
pointer to the new panel.
.TP
.B update_panels()
refreshes the virtual screen to reflect the relations between the
panels in the stack, but does not call doupdate() to refresh the
physical screen.  Use this function and not wrefresh or wnoutrefresh.
update_panels() may be called more than once before a call to
doupdate(), but doupdate() is the function responsible for updating
the physical screen.
.TP
.B del_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the  stack and deallocates the
\fBPANEL\fR structure (but not its associated window).
.TP
.B hide_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the panel stack and thus hides it from
view. The \fBPANEL\fR structure is not lost, merely removed from the stack.
.TP
.B panel_hidden(pan)
returns TRUE if the panel is in the panel stack,
FALSE if it is not.
If the panel is a null pointer, return ERR.
.TP
.B show_panel(pan)
makes a hidden panel visible by placing it on top of the panels in the
panel stack. See COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B top_panel(pan)
puts the given visible panel on top of all panels in the stack.  See
COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B bottom_panel(pan)
puts panel at the bottom of all panels.
.TP
.B move_panel(pan,starty,startx)
moves the given panel window so that its upper-left corner is at
\fBstarty\fR, \fBstartx\fR.  It does not change the position of the
panel in the stack.  Be sure to use this function, not \fBmvwin()\fR,
to move a panel window.
.TP
.B replace_panel(pan,window)
replaces the current window of panel with \fBwindow\fR (useful, for
example if you want to resize a panel; if you're using \fBncurses\fR,
you can call \fBreplace_panel\fR on the output of \fBwresize\fR(3X)).
It does not change the position of the panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_above(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel above pan.  If the panel argument is
\fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the bottom panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_below(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If the panel argument
is \fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the top panel in the stack.
.TP
.B set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)
sets the panel's user pointer.
.TP
.B panel_userptr(pan)
returns the user pointer for a given panel.
.TP
.B panel_window(pan)
returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Each routine that returns a pointer returns \fBNULL\fR if an error
occurs. Each routine that returns an int value returns \fBOK\fR if it
executes successfully and \fBERR\fR if not.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Reasonable care has been taken to  ensure  compatibility
with  the  native  panel facility introduced in SVr3.2 (inspection of
the SVr4 manual pages suggests the programming interface is unchanged).
The \fBPANEL\fR data structures are merely  similar. The  programmer
is cautioned not to directly use \fBPANEL\fR fields.
.P
The functions \fBshow_panel()\fR and \fBtop_panel()\fR are identical
in this implementation, and work equally well with displayed or hidden
panels.  In the native System V implementation, \fBshow_panel()\fR is
intended for making a hidden panel visible (at the top of the stack)
and \fBtop_panel()\fR is intended for making an already-visible panel
move to the top of the stack. You are cautioned to use the correct
function to ensure compatibility with native panel libraries.
.SH NOTE
In your library list, libpanel.a should be before libncurses.a; that is,
you want to say `-lpanel -lncurses', not the other way around (which would
usually give a link-error).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Panels are \fBcurses\fR(3X) windows with the added feature of
depth.  Panel functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure
the proper portions of each window and the curses \fBstdscr\fR window are
hidden or displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or removed.
The set of currently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The
\fBstdscr\fR window is beneath all panels, and is not considered part
of the stack.
.P
A window is associated with every panel. The panel routines enable
you to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a
panel at any desired location in the stack.
.P
Panel routines are a functional layer added to \fBcurses\fR(3X), make only
high-level curses calls, and work anywhere terminfo curses does.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B new_panel(win)
allocates  a  \fBPANEL\fR structure, associates it with
\fBwin\fR, places the panel on the top of the stack  (causes  it
to  be  displayed above any other panel) and returns a
pointer to the new panel.
.TP
.B update_panels()
refreshes the virtual screen to reflect the relations between the
panels in the stack, but does not call doupdate() to refresh the
physical screen.  Use this function and not wrefresh or wnoutrefresh.
update_panels() may be called more than once before a call to
doupdate(), but doupdate() is the function responsible for updating
the physical screen.
.TP
.B del_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the  stack and deallocates the
\fBPANEL\fR structure (but not its associated window).
.TP
.B hide_panel(pan)
removes the given panel from the panel stack and thus hides it from
view. The \fBPANEL\fR structure is not lost, merely removed from the stack.
.TP
.B panel_hidden(pan)
returns TRUE if the panel is in the panel stack,
FALSE if it is not.
If the panel is a null pointer, return ERR.
.TP
.B show_panel(pan)
makes a hidden panel visible by placing it on top of the panels in the
panel stack. See COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B top_panel(pan)
puts the given visible panel on top of all panels in the stack.  See
COMPATIBILITY below.
.TP
.B bottom_panel(pan)
puts panel at the bottom of all panels.
.TP
.B move_panel(pan,starty,startx)
moves the given panel window so that its upper-left corner is at
\fBstarty\fR, \fBstartx\fR.  It does not change the position of the
panel in the stack.  Be sure to use this function, not \fBmvwin()\fR,
to move a panel window.
.TP
.B replace_panel(pan,window)
replaces the current window of panel with \fBwindow\fR (useful, for
example if you want to resize a panel; if you're using \fBncurses\fR,
you can call \fBreplace_panel\fR on the output of \fBwresize\fR(3X)).
It does not change the position of the panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_above(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel above pan.  If the panel argument is
\fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the bottom panel in the stack.
.TP
.B panel_below(pan)
returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If the panel argument
is \fB(PANEL *)0\fR, it returns a pointer to the top panel in the stack.
.TP
.B set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)
sets the panel's user pointer.
.TP
.B panel_userptr(pan)
returns the user pointer for a given panel.
.TP
.B panel_window(pan)
returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Each routine that returns a pointer returns \fBNULL\fR if an error
occurs. Each routine that returns an int value returns \fBOK\fR if it
executes successfully and \fBERR\fR if not.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Reasonable care has been taken to  ensure  compatibility
with  the  native  panel facility introduced in SVr3.2 (inspection of
the SVr4 manual pages suggests the programming interface is unchanged).
The \fBPANEL\fR data structures are merely  similar. The  programmer
is cautioned not to directly use \fBPANEL\fR fields.
.P
The functions \fBshow_panel()\fR and \fBtop_panel()\fR are identical
in this implementation, and work equally well with displayed or hidden
panels.  In the native System V implementation, \fBshow_panel()\fR is
intended for making a hidden panel visible (at the top of the stack)
and \fBtop_panel()\fR is intended for making an already-visible panel
move to the top of the stack. You are cautioned to use the correct
function to ensure compatibility with native panel libraries.
.SH NOTE
In your library list, libpanel.a should be before libncurses.a; that is,
you want to say `-lpanel -lncurses', not the other way around (which would
usually give a link-error).

Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from
those modules at the same time.  Mostly similar in effect to

.PP
By default, every base class needs to live in a file of its own.
If you want to have a subclass and its parent class in the same file, you
can tell \f(CW\*(C`parent\*(C'\fR not to load any modules by using the \f(CW\*(C`\-norequire\*(C'\fR switch:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package Foo;
\&  sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
\&
\&  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
\&  use parent \-norequire, \*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(AqBar\*(Aq;
\&  # will not go looking for Foo.pm or Bar.pm
.Ve
.PP
This is equivalent to the following code:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package Foo;
\&  sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
\&
\&  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
\&  push @DoesNotLoadFooBar::ISA, \*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(AqBar\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This is also helpful for the case where a package lives within
a differently named file:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  package MyHash;
\&  use Tie::Hash;
\&  use parent \-norequire, \*(AqTie::StdHash\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This is equivalent to the following code:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  package MyHash;
\&  require Tie::Hash;
\&  push @ISA, \*(AqTie::StdHash\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to load a subclass from a file that \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR would
not consider an eligible filename (that is, it does not end in
either \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.pmc\*(C'\fR), use the following code:
.PP

By default, every base class needs to live in a file of its own.
If you want to have a subclass and its parent class in the same file, you
can tell \f(CW\*(C`parent\*(C'\fR not to load any modules by using the \f(CW\*(C`\-norequire\*(C'\fR switch:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package Foo;
\&  sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
\&
\&  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
\&  use parent \-norequire, \*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(AqBar\*(Aq;
\&  # will not go looking for Foo.pm or Bar.pm
.Ve
.PP
This is equivalent to the following code:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package Foo;

\&
\&  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
\&  push @DoesNotLoadFooBar::ISA, \*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(AqBar\*(Aq;

This is also helpful for the case where a package lives within
a differently named file:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  package MyHash;

If you want to load a subclass from a file that \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR would
not consider an eligible filename (that is, it does not end in
either \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.pmc\*(C'\fR), use the following code:

.SH NAME
pcap \- Packet Capture library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.LP
.ft B
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Packet Capture library
provides a high level interface to packet capture systems. All packets
on the network, even those destined for other hosts, are accessible
through this mechanism.
It also supports saving captured packets to a ``savefile'', and reading
packets from a ``savefile''.
.SS Opening a capture handle for reading
To open a handle for a live capture, given the name of the network or
other interface on which the capture should be done, call
.BR pcap_create (),
set the appropriate options on the handle, and then activate it with
.BR pcap_activate ().
.PP
To obtain a list of devices that can be opened for a live capture, call
.BR pcap_findalldevs ();
to free the list returned by
.BR pcap_findalldevs (),
call
.BR pcap_freealldevs ().
.BR pcap_lookupdev ()
will return the first device on that list that is not a ``loopback``
network interface.
.PP
To open a handle for a ``savefile'' from which to read packets, given the
pathname of the ``savefile'', call
.BR pcap_open_offline ();
to set up a handle for a ``savefile'', given a
.B "FILE\ *"
referring to a file already opened for reading, call
.BR pcap_fopen_offline ().
.PP
In order to get a ``fake''
.B pcap_t
for use in routines that require a
.B pcap_t
as an argument, such as routines to open a ``savefile'' for writing and
to compile a filter expression, call
.BR pcap_open_dead ().
.PP
.BR pcap_create (),
.BR pcap_open_offline (),
.BR pcap_fopen_offline (),
and
.BR pcap_open_dead ()
return a pointer to a
.BR pcap_t ,
which is the handle used for reading packets from the capture stream or
the ``savefile'', and for finding out information about the capture
stream or ``savefile''.
To close a handle, use
.BR pcap_close ().
.PP
The options that can be set on a capture handle include
.IP "snapshot length"
If, when capturing, you capture the entire contents of the packet, that
requires more CPU time to copy the packet to your application, more disk
and possibly network bandwidth to write the packet data to a file, and
more disk space to save the packet.  If you don't need the entire
contents of the packet - for example, if you are only interested in the
TCP headers of packets - you can set the "snapshot length" for the
capture to an appropriate value.  If the snapshot length is set to
.IR snaplen ,
and
.I snaplen
is less
than the size of a packet that is captured, only the first
.I snaplen
bytes of that packet will be captured and provided as packet data.
.IP
A snapshot length of 65535 should be sufficient, on most if not all
networks, to capture all the data available from the packet.
.IP
The snapshot length is set with
.BR pcap_set_snaplen ().
.IP "promiscuous mode"
On broadcast LANs such as Ethernet, if the network isn't switched, or if
the adapter is connected to a "mirror port" on a switch to which all
packets passing through the switch are sent, a network adapter receives
all packets on the LAN, including unicast or multicast packets not sent
to a network address that the network adapter isn't configured to
recognize.
.IP
Normally, the adapter will discard those packets; however, many network
adapters support "promiscuous mode", which is a mode in which all
packets, even if they are not sent to an address that the adapter
recognizes, are provided to the host.  This is useful for passively
capturing traffic between two or more other hosts for analysis.
.IP
Note that even if an application does not set promiscuous mode, the
adapter could well be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.
.IP
For now, this doesn't work on the "any" device; if an argument of "any"
or NULL is supplied, the setting of promiscuous mode is ignored.
.IP
Promiscuous mode is set with
.BR pcap_set_promisc ().
.IP "monitor mode"
On IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, even if an adapter is in promiscuous mode,
it will supply to the host only frames for the network with which it's
associated.  It might also supply only data frames, not management or
control frames, and might not provide the 802.11 header or radio
information pseudo-header for those frames.
.IP
In "monitor mode", sometimes also called "rfmon mode" (for "Radio
Frequency MONitor"), the adapter will supply all frames that it
receives, with 802.11 headers, and might supply a pseudo-header with
radio information about the frame as well.
.IP
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.
.IP
Monitor mode is set with
.BR pcap_set_rfmon (),
and
.BR pcap_can_set_rfmon ()
can be used to determine whether an adapter can be put into monitor
mode.
.IP "read timeout"
If, when capturing, packets are delivered as soon as they arrive, the
application capturing the packets will be woken up for each packet as it
arrives, and might have to make one or more calls to the operating
system to fetch each packet.
.IP
If, instead, packets are not delivered as soon as they arrive, but are
delivered after a short delay (called a "read timeout"), more than one
packet can be accumulated before the packets are delivered, so that a
single wakeup would be done for multiple packets, and each set of calls
made to the operating system would supply multiple packets, rather than
a single packet.  This reduces the per-packet CPU overhead if packets
are arriving at a high rate, increasing the number of packets per second
that can be captured.
.IP
The read timeout is required so that an application won't wait for the
operating system's capture buffer to fill up before packets are
delivered; if packets are arriving slowly, that wait could take an
arbitrarily long period of time.
.IP
Not all platforms support a read timeout; on platforms that
don't, the read timeout is ignored.  A zero value for the timeout,
on platforms that support a read timeout, has platform-dependent
behavior that could cause a read to wait for an unlimited amount
of time until the capture buffer fills up or could cause a read timeout
of 1 millisecond to be used.  We recommend that a value of zero not be
used.
.IP
.BR NOTE :
the read timeout cannot be used to cause calls that read
packets to return within a limited period of time, because, on some
platforms, the read timeout isn't supported, and, on other platforms,
the timer doesn't start until at least one packet arrives.  This means
that the read timeout should
.B NOT
be used, for example, in an interactive application to allow the packet
capture loop to ``poll'' for user input periodically, as there's no
guarantee that a call reading packets will return after the timeout
expires even if no packets have arrived.
.IP
The read timeout is set with
.BR pcap_set_timeout ().
.IP "buffer size"
Packets that arrive for a capture are stored in a buffer, so that they
do not have to be read by the application as soon as they arrive.  On
some platforms, the buffer's size can be set; a size that's too small
could mean that, if too many packets are being captured and the snapshot
length doesn't limit the amount of data that's buffered, packets could
be dropped if the buffer fills up before the application can read
packets from it, while a size that's too large could use more
non-pageable operating system memory than is necessary to prevent
packets from being dropped.
.IP
The buffer size is set with
.BR pcap_set_buffer_size ().
.IP "timestamp type"
On some platforms, the time stamp given to packets on live captures can
come from different sources that can have different resolutions or that
can have different relationships to the time values for the current time
supplied by routines on the native operating system.  See
.BR pcap-tstamp (7)
for a list of time stamp types.
.IP
The time stamp type is set with
.BR pcap_set_tstamp_type ().
.PP
Reading packets from a network interface may require that you have
special privileges:
.TP
.B Under SunOS 3.x or 4.x with NIT or BPF:
You must have read access to
.I /dev/nit
or
.IR /dev/bpf* .
.TP
.B Under Solaris with DLPI:
You must have read/write access to the network pseudo device, e.g.
.IR /dev/le .
On at least some versions of Solaris, however, this is not sufficient to
allow
.I tcpdump
to capture in promiscuous mode; on those versions of Solaris, you must
be root, or the application capturing packets
must be installed setuid to root, in order to capture in promiscuous
mode.  Note that, on many (perhaps all) interfaces, if you don't capture
in promiscuous mode, you will not see any outgoing packets, so a capture
not done in promiscuous mode may not be very useful.
.IP
In newer versions of Solaris, you must have been given the
.B net_rawaccess
privilege; this is both necessary and sufficient to give you access to the
network pseudo-device - there is no need to change the privileges on
that device.  A user can be given that privilege by, for example, adding
that privilege to the user's
.B defaultpriv
key with the
.B usermod (1M)
command.
.TP
.B Under HP-UX with DLPI:
You must be root or the application capturing packets must be installed
setuid to root.
.TP
.B Under IRIX with snoop:
You must be root or the application capturing packets must be installed
setuid to root.
.TP
.B Under Linux:
You must be root or the application capturing packets must be installed
setuid to root (unless your distribution has a kernel
that supports capability bits such as CAP_NET_RAW and code to allow
those capability bits to be given to particular accounts and to cause
those bits to be set on a user's initial processes when they log in, in
which case you  must have CAP_NET_RAW in order to capture and
CAP_NET_ADMIN to enumerate network devices with, for example, the
.B \-D
flag).
.TP
.B Under ULTRIX and Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX:
Any user may capture network traffic.
However, no user (not even the super-user) can capture in promiscuous
mode on an interface unless the super-user has enabled promiscuous-mode
operation on that interface using
.IR pfconfig (8),
and no user (not even the super-user) can capture unicast traffic
received by or sent by the machine on an interface unless the super-user
has enabled copy-all-mode operation on that interface using
.IR pfconfig ,
so
.I useful
packet capture on an interface probably requires that either
promiscuous-mode or copy-all-mode operation, or both modes of
operation, be enabled on that interface.
.TP
.B Under BSD (this includes Mac OS X):
You must have read access to
.I /dev/bpf*
on systems that don't have a cloning BPF device, or to
.I /dev/bpf
on systems that do.
On BSDs with a devfs (this includes Mac OS X), this might involve more
than just having somebody with super-user access setting the ownership
or permissions on the BPF devices - it might involve configuring devfs
to set the ownership or permissions every time the system is booted,
if the system even supports that; if it doesn't support that, you might
have to find some other way to make that happen at boot time.
.PP
Reading a saved packet file doesn't require special privileges.
.PP
The packets read from the handle may include a ``pseudo-header''
containing various forms of packet meta-data, and probably includes a
link-layer header whose contents can differ for different network
interfaces.  To determine the format of the packets supplied by the
handle, call
.BR pcap_datalink ();
.I http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
lists the values it returns and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.
.PP
Do
.B NOT
assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
.B DLT_LINUX_SLL
even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.

.SS Reading packets
Packets are read with
.BR pcap_dispatch ()
or
.BR pcap_loop (),
which process one or more packets, calling a callback routine for each
packet, or with
.BR pcap_next ()
or
.BR pcap_next_ex (),
which return the next packet.
The callback for
.BR pcap_dispatch ()
and
.BR pcap_loop ()
is supplied a pointer to a
.IR "struct pcap_pkthdr" ,
which includes the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B ts
a
.I struct timeval
containing the time when the packet was captured
.TP
.B caplen
a
.I bpf_u_int32
giving the number of bytes of the packet that are available from the
capture
.TP
.B len
a
.I bpf_u_int32
giving the length of the packet, in bytes (which might be more than the
number of bytes available from the capture, if the length of the packet
is larger than the maximum number of bytes to capture).
.RE
.PP
The callback is also supplied a
.I const u_char
pointer to the first
.B caplen
(as given in the
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
mentioned above)
bytes of data from the packet.  This won't necessarily be the entire
packet; to capture the entire packet, you will have to provide a value
for
.I snaplen
in your call to
.BR pcap_set_snaplen ()
that is sufficiently large to get all of the packet's data - a value of
65535 should be sufficient on most if not all networks).  When reading
from a ``savefile'', the snapshot length specified when the capture was
performed will limit the amount of packet data available.
.PP
.BR pcap_next ()
is passed an argument that points to a
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
structure, and fills it in with the time stamp and length values for the
packet.  It returns a
.I const u_char
to the first
.B caplen
bytes of the packet on success, and NULL on error.
.PP
.BR pcap_next_ex ()
is passed two pointer arguments, one of which points to a
.IR struct pcap_pkthdr *
and one of which points to a 
.IR "const u_char" *.
It sets the first pointer to point to a
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
structure with the time stamp and length values for the packet, and sets
the second pointer to point to the first
.B caplen
bytes of the packet.
.PP
To force the loop in
.BR pcap_dispatch ()
or
.BR pcap_loop ()
to terminate, call
.BR pcap_breakloop ().
.PP
By default, when reading packets from an interface opened for a live
capture,
.BR pcap_dispatch (),
.BR pcap_next (),
and
.BR pcap_next_ex ()
will, if no packets are currently available to be read, block waiting
for packets to become available.  On some, but
.I not
all, platforms, if a read timeout was specified, the wait will terminate
after the read timeout expires; applications should be prepared for
this, as it happens on some platforms, but should not rely on it, as it
does not happen on other platforms.
.PP
A handle can be put into ``non-blocking mode'', so that those routines
will, rather than blocking, return an indication that no packets are
available to read.  Call
.BR pcap_setnonblock ()
to put a handle into non-blocking mode or to take it out of non-blocking
mode; call
.BR pcap_getnonblock ()
to determine whether a handle is in non-blocking mode.  Note that
non-blocking mode does not work correctly in Mac OS X 10.6.
.PP
Non-blocking mode is often combined with routines such as
.BR select (2)
or
.BR poll (2)
or other routines a platform offers to wait for the availability of data
on any of a set of descriptors.  To obtain, for a handle, a descriptor
that can be used in those routines, call
.BR pcap_get_selectable_fd ().
Not all handles have such a descriptor available;
.BR pcap_get_selectable_fd ()
will return \-1 if no such descriptor exists.  In addition, for various
reasons, one or more of those routines will not work properly with the
descriptor; the documentation for
.BR pcap_get_selectable_fd ()
gives details.

.SS Filters
In order to cause only certain packets to be returned when reading
packets, a filter can be set on a handle.  For a live capture, the
filtering will be performed in kernel mode, if possible, to avoid
copying ``uninteresting'' packets from the kernel to user mode.
.PP
A filter can be specified as a text string; the syntax and semantics of
the string are as described by
.BR pcap-filter (7).
A filter string is compiled into a program in a pseudo-machine-language
by
.BR pcap_compile ()
and the resulting program can be made a filter for a handle with
.BR pcap_setfilter ().
The result of
.BR pcap_compile ()
can be freed with a call to
.BR pcap_freecode ().
.BR pcap_compile ()
may require a network mask for certain expressions in the filter string;
.BR pcap_lookupnet ()
can be used to find the network address and network mask for a given
capture device.

A compiled filter can also be applied directly to a packet that has been
read using

.TH PCAP_BREAKLOOP 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_breakloop \- force a pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop() call to return
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
void pcap_breakloop(pcap_t *);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_breakloop()
sets a flag that will force
.B pcap_dispatch()
or
.B pcap_loop()
to return rather than looping; they will return the number of packets
that have been processed so far, or \-2 if no packets have been
processed so far.
.PP
This routine is safe to use inside a signal handler on UNIX or a console
control handler on Windows, as it merely sets a flag that is checked
within the loop.
.PP
The flag is checked in loops reading packets from the OS - a signal by
itself will not necessarily terminate those loops - as well as in loops
processing a set of packets returned by the OS.
.ft B
Note that if you are catching signals on UNIX systems that support
restarting system calls after a signal, and calling pcap_breakloop()
in the signal handler, you must specify, when catching those signals,
that system calls should NOT be restarted by that signal.  Otherwise,
if the signal interrupted a call reading packets in a live capture,
when your signal handler returns after calling pcap_breakloop(), the
call will be restarted, and the loop will not terminate until more
packets arrive and the call completes.
.ft R
.PP
.ft B
Note also that, in a multi-threaded application, if one thread is
blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), pcap_next(), or pcap_next_ex(),
a call to pcap_breakloop() in a different thread will not unblock that
thread; you will need to use whatever mechanism the OS provides for
breaking a thread out of blocking calls in order to unblock the thread,
such as thread cancellation in systems that support POSIX threads.
.ft R
.PP
Note that
.B pcap_next()
and
.B pcap_next_ex()
will, on some platforms, loop reading packets from the OS; that loop
will not necessarily be terminated by a signal, so
.B pcap_breakloop()
should be used to terminate packet processing even if
.B pcap_next()
or
.B pcap_next_ex()
is being used.
.PP
.B pcap_breakloop()
does not guarantee that no further packets will be processed by
.B pcap_dispatch()
or
.B pcap_loop()
after it is called; at most one more packet might be processed.
.PP
If \-2 is returned from
.B pcap_dispatch()
or
.BR pcap_loop() ,
the flag is cleared, so a subsequent call will resume reading packets. 
If a positive number is returned, the flag is not cleared, so a
subsequent call will return \-2 and clear the flag.

.TH PCAP_COMPILE 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_compile \- compile a filter expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_compile(pcap_t *p, struct bpf_program *fp,
.ti +8
const char *str, int optimize, bpf_u_int32 netmask);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_compile()
is used to compile the string
.I str
into a filter program.  See
.BR pcap-filter (7)
for the syntax of that string.
.I program
is a pointer to a
.I bpf_program
struct and is filled in by
.BR pcap_compile() .
.I optimize
controls whether optimization on the resulting code is performed.
.I netmask
specifies the IPv4 netmask of the network on which packets are being
captured; it is used only when checking for IPv4 broadcast addresses in
the filter program.  If the netmask of the network on which packets are
being captured isn't known to the program, or if packets are being
captured on the Linux "any" pseudo-interface that can capture on more
than one network, a value of PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN can be supplied; tests
for IPv4 broadcast addresses will fail to compile, but all other tests in
the filter program will be OK.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_compile()
returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
If \-1 is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.

.TH PCAP_CREATE 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_create \- create a live capture handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.nf
.ft B
char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
.ft
.LP
.ft B
pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_create()
is used to create a packet capture handle to look
at packets on the network.
.I source
is a string that specifies the network device to open; on Linux systems
with 2.2 or later kernels, a
.I source
argument of "any" or
.B NULL
can be used to capture packets from all interfaces.
.PP
On Darwin systems version 13 or later, a 
.I source
argument of "all" or "any"
can be used to capture packets from all interfaces. 
A 
.I source
argument of 
.B NULL
can be used to capture packets from all physical interfaces, 
i.e. excluding loopback, virtual and tunnel interfaces.
.PP
The returned handle must be activated with
.B pcap_activate()
before packets can be captured
with it; options for the capture, such as promiscuous mode, can be set
on the handle before activating it.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_create()
returns a
.I pcap_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.I errbuf
is assumed to be able to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_datalink(pcap_t *p);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_datalink()
returns the link-layer header type for the live capture or ``savefile''
specified by
.IR p .
.PP
It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by
.B pcap_create()
that has not yet been activated by
.BR pcap_activate() .
.PP
.I http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
lists the values
.B pcap_datalink()
can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.
.PP
Do
.B NOT
assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
.B DLT_LINUX_SLL
even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_datalink()
returns the link-layer header type on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated.

.ft
.nf
.LP
.ft B
pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_fopen(pcap_t *p, FILE *fp);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_dump_open()
is called to open a ``savefile'' for writing.
.I fname
specifies the name of the file to open. The file will have
the same format as those used by
.BR tcpdump (1)
and
.BR tcpslice (1).
The name "-" in a synonym
for
.BR stdout .
.PP
.B pcap_dump_fopen()
is called to write data to an existing open stream
.IR fp .
Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.
.PP
.I p
is a capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
.B pcap_create()
and activated by an earlier call to
.BR pcap_activate() ,
or returned by an earlier call to
.BR pcap_open_offline() ,
.BR pcap_open_live() ,
or
.BR pcap_open_dead() .
The link-layer type and snapshot length from
.I p
are used as the link-layer type and snapshot length of the output file.
.SH RETURN VALUES
A pointer to a
.B pcap_dumper_t
structure to use in subsequent
.B pcap_dump()
and
.B pcap_dump_close()
calls is returned on success.
.B NULL
is returned on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.B pcap_geterr(\fIp\fB)
can be used to get the error text.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
FILE *pcap_file(pcap_t *p);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_file()
returns the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile,'' if a ``savefile''
was opened with
.BR pcap_open_offline() ,
or NULL, if a network device was opened with
.B pcap_create()
and
.BR pcap_activate() ,
or with
.BR pcap_open_live() .
.PP
Note that the Packet Capture library is usually built with large file
support, so the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile'' might refer to
a file larger than 2 gigabytes; applications that use
.B pcap_file()
should, if possible, use calls that support large files on the return
value of
.B pcap_file()
or the value returned by
.B fileno()
when passed the return value of
.BR pcap_file() .

.TH PCAP_FINDALLDEVS 3PCAP "22 August 2010"
.SH NAME
pcap_findalldevs, pcap_freealldevs \- get a list of capture devices, and
free that list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.nf
.ft B
char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_findalldevs(pcap_if_t **alldevsp, char *errbuf);
void pcap_freealldevs(pcap_if_t *alldevs);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_findalldevs()
constructs a list of network devices that can be opened with
.B pcap_create()
and
.B pcap_activate()
or with
.BR pcap_open_live() .
(Note that there may be network devices that cannot be opened by the
process calling
.BR pcap_findalldevs() ,
because, for example, that process does not have sufficient privileges
to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will not appear on the
list.)
If
.B pcap_findalldevs()
succeeds, the pointer pointed to by
.I alldevsp
is set to point to the first element of the list, or to
.B NULL
if no devices were found (this is considered success).
Each element of the list is of type
.BR pcap_if_t ,
and has the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B next
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to the next element in the list;
.B NULL
for the last element of the list
.TP
.B name
a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to
.B pcap_open_live()
.TP
.B description
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a string giving a human-readable description of the device
.TP
.B addresses
a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the
device,
or
.B NULL
if the device has no addresses
.TP
.B flags
device flags:
.RS
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK
set if the device is a loopback interface
.RE
.RE
.PP
Each element of the list of addresses is of type
.BR pcap_addr_t ,
and has the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B next
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to the next element in the list;
.B NULL
for the last element of the list
.TP
.B addr
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
containing an address
.TP
.B netmask
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to by
.B addr
.TP
.B broadaddr
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the broadcast address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
.BR addr ;
may be null if the device doesn't support broadcasts
.TP
.B dstaddr
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the destination address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
.BR addr ;
may be null if the device isn't a point-to-point interface
.RE
.PP
Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so you must
check the
.B sa_family
member of the
.B "struct sockaddr"
before interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the
addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
IPv4 addresses have the value
.BR AF_INET ,
IPv6 addresses have the value
.B AF_INET6
(which older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not
define), and other addresses have other values.  Whether other addresses
are returned, and what types they might have is platform-dependent.
For IPv4 addresses, the
.B "struct sockaddr"
pointer can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
.BR "struct sockaddr_in" ;
for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
.BR "struct sockaddr_in6".
.PP
The list of devices must be freed with
.BR pcap_freealldevs() ,
whch frees the list pointed to by
.IR alldevs .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_findalldevs()
returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure; as indicated, finding no
devices is considered success, rather than failure, so 0 will be
returned in that case.
If \-1 is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.I errbuf
is assumed to be able to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.

.TH PCAP_GET_SELECTABLE_FD 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_get_selectable_fd \- get a file descriptor on which a select() can
be done for a live capture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_get_selectable_fd(pcap_t *p);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_get_selectable_fd()
returns, on UNIX, a file descriptor number for a file descriptor on
which one can
do a
.B select()
or
.B poll()
to wait for it to be possible to read packets without blocking, if such
a descriptor exists, or \-1, if no such descriptor exists.  Some network
devices opened with
.B pcap_create()
and
.BR pcap_activate() ,
or with
.BR pcap_open_live() ,
do not support
.B select()
or
.B poll()
(for example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4, and Endace
DAG devices), so \-1 is returned for those devices.
.PP
Note that in:
.IP
FreeBSD prior to FreeBSD 4.6;
.IP
NetBSD prior to NetBSD 3.0;
.IP
OpenBSD prior to OpenBSD 2.4;
.IP
Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X 10.7;
.PP
.B select()
and
.B poll()
do not work correctly on BPF devices;
.B pcap_get_selectable_fd()
will return a file descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions
being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), but a simple
.B select()
or
.B poll()
will not indicate that the descriptor is readable until a full buffer's
worth of packets is received, even if the read timeout expires before
then.  To work around this, an application that uses
.B select()
or
.B poll()
to wait for packets to arrive must put the
.B pcap_t
in non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the
.B select()
or
.B poll()
have a timeout less than or equal to the read timeout,
and must try to read packets after that timeout expires, regardless of
whether
.B select()
or
.B poll()
indicated that the file descriptor for the
.B pcap_t
is ready to be read or not.  (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD
4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6 and later,
.B select()
and
.B poll()
work correctly on BPF devices, so the workaround isn't necessary,
although it does no harm.)
.PP
Note also that
.B poll()
doesn't work on character special files, including BPF devices, in Mac
OS X 10.4 and 10.5, so, while
.B select()
can be used on the descriptor returned by
.BR pcap_get_selectable_fd() ,
.B poll()
cannot be used on it those versions of Mac OS X.  Kqueues also don't
work on that descriptor.
.BR poll() ,
but not kqueues, work on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases prior to
10.4;
.B poll()
and kqueues work on that descriptor in Mac OS X 10.6 and later.
.PP
.B pcap_get_selectable_fd()
is not available on Windows.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A selectable file descriptor is returned if one exists; otherwise, \-1
is returned.

.TH PCAP_INJECT 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_inject, pcap_sendpacket \- transmit a packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_inject(pcap_t *p, const void *buf, size_t size);
int pcap_sendpacket(pcap_t *p, const u_char *buf, int size);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_inject()
sends a raw packet through the network interface;
.I buf
points to the data of the packet, including the link-layer header, and
.I size
is the number of bytes in the packet.
.PP
Note that, even if you successfully open the network interface, you
might not have permission to send packets on it, or it might not support
sending packets; as
.I pcap_open_live()
doesn't have a flag to indicate whether to open for capturing, sending,
or capturing and sending, you cannot request an open that supports
sending and be notified at open time whether sending will be possible.
Note also that some devices might not support sending packets.
.PP
Note that, on some platforms, the link-layer header of the packet that's
sent might not be the same as the link-layer header of the packet
supplied to
.BR pcap_inject() ,
as the source link-layer address, if the header contains such an
address, might be changed to be the address assigned to the interface on
which the packet it sent, if the platform doesn't support sending
completely raw and unchanged packets.  Even worse, some drivers on some
platforms might change the link-layer type field to whatever value
libpcap used when attaching to the device, even on platforms that
.I do
nominally support sending completely raw and unchanged packets.
.PP
.B pcap_sendpacket()
is like
.BR pcap_inject() ,
but it returns 0 on success, rather than returning the number of bytes
written.
.RB ( pcap_inject()
comes from OpenBSD;
.B pcap_sendpacket()
comes from WinPcap.  Both are provided for compatibility.)
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_inject()
returns the number of bytes written on success and \-1 on failure.
.PP
.B pcap_sendpacket()
returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.PP
If \-1 is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_list_datalinks()
is used to get a list of the supported link-layer header types of the
interface associated with the pcap descriptor.
.B pcap_list_datalinks()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.IR *dlt_buf 
to point to that array.
.LP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR pcap_free_datalinks() ,
which frees the list of link-layer header types pointed to by
.IR dlt_list .
.LP
It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by
.B pcap_create()
that has not yet been activated by
.BR pcap_activate() .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_list_datalinks()
returns the number of link-layer header types in the array on success,
.B PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,
and
.B PCAP_ERROR
(\-1) on other errors.
If
.B PCAP_ERROR
is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
is used to get a list of the supported time stamp types of the interface
associated with the pcap descriptor.
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.I *tstamp_typesp
to point to the array.
See
.BR pcap-tstamp (7)
for a list of all the time stamp types.
.PP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR pcap_free_tstamp_types() ,
which frees the list pointed to by
.IR tstamp_types .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
returns the number of time stamp types in the array on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR
on failure.
A return value of zero means that you cannot specify a time stamp type;
you are limited to the capture device's default time stamp type.
If
.B PCAP_ERROR
is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.

.TH PCAP_LOOP 3PCAP "24 December 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_loop, pcap_dispatch \- process packets from a live capture or savefile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
typedef void (*pcap_handler)(u_char *user, const struct pcap_pkthdr *h,
.ti +8
			     const u_char *bytes);
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_loop(pcap_t *p, int cnt,
.ti +8
pcap_handler callback, u_char *user);
int pcap_dispatch(pcap_t *p, int cnt,
.ti +8
pcap_handler callback, u_char *user);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_loop()
processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile'' until
.I cnt
packets are processed, the end of the ``savefile'' is
reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
.B pcap_breakloop()
is called, or an error occurs.
It does
.B not
return when live read timeouts occur.
A value of \-1 or 0 for
.I cnt
is equivalent to infinity, so that packets are processed until another
ending condition occurs.
.PP
.B pcap_dispatch()
processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile'' until
.I cnt
packets are processed, the end of the current bufferful of packets is
reached when doing a live capture, the end of the ``savefile'' is
reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
.B pcap_breakloop()
is called, or an error occurs.
Thus, when doing a live capture,
.I cnt
is the maximum number of packets to process before returning, but is not
a minimum number; when reading a live capture, only one
bufferful of packets is read at a time, so fewer than
.I cnt
packets may be processed. A value of \-1 or 0 for
.I cnt
causes all the packets received in one buffer to be processed when
reading a live capture, and causes all the packets in the file to be
processed when reading a ``savefile''.
.PP
.ft B
(In older versions of libpcap, the behavior when
\fIcnt\fP
was 0 was undefined; different platforms and devices behaved
differently, so code that must work with older versions of libpcap
should use \-1, not 0, as the value of
\fIcnt\fP.)
.ft R
.PP
.I callback
specifies a
.I pcap_handler
routine to be called with three arguments:
a
.I u_char
pointer which is passed in the
.I user
argument to
.B pcap_loop()
or
.BR pcap_dispatch() ,
a
.I const struct pcap_pkthdr
pointer pointing to the packet time stamp and lengths, and a
.I const u_char
pointer to the first
.B caplen
(as given in the
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
a pointer to which is passed to the callback routine)
bytes of data from the packet.  The
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
and the packet data are not to be freed by the callback routine, and are
not guaranteed to be valid after the callback routine returns; if the
code needs them to be valid after the callback, it must make a copy of
them.
.PP
The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
.B pcap_datalink()
routine when handed the
.B pcap_t
value also passed to
.B pcap_loop()
or
.BR pcap_dispatch() .
.I http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
lists the values
.B pcap_datalink()
can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all
packets received unless and until
.B pcap_set_datalink()
is called; after a successful call to
.BR pcap_set_datalink() ,
all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type
specified by the link-layer header type value passed to
.BR pcap_set_datalink() .
.PP
Do
.B NOT
assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
.B DLT_LINUX_SLL
even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_loop()
returns 0 if
.I cnt
is exhausted or if, when reading from a ``savefile'', no more packets
are available.  It returns \-1 if an error occurs or \-2 if the loop
terminated due to a call to
.B pcap_breakloop()
before any packets were processed.
It does
.B not
return when live read timeouts occur; instead, it attempts to read more
packets.
.PP
.B pcap_dispatch()
returns the number of packets processed on success; this can be 0 if no
packets were read from a live capture (if, for example, they were
discarded because they didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on
platforms that support a read timeout that starts before any packets
arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the file
descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no packets
were available to be read) or if no more packets are available in a
``savefile.''  It returns \-1 if an error occurs or \-2 if the loop
terminated due to a call to
.B pcap_breakloop()
before any packets were processed.
.ft B
If your application uses pcap_breakloop(),
make sure that you explicitly check for \-1 and \-2, rather than just
checking for a return value < 0.
.ft R
.PP
If \-1 is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.

pcap_next_ex, pcap_next \- read the next packet from a pcap_t
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_next_ex(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr **pkt_header,

.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_next_ex()
reads the next packet and returns a success/failure indication.
If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by the
.I pkt_header
argument is set to point to the
.I pcap_pkthdr
struct for the packet, and the
pointer pointed to by the
.I pkt_data
argument is set to point to the data in the packet.  The
.I struct pcap_pkthdr
and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
.BR pcap_next_ex() ,
.BR pcap_next() ,
.BR pcap_loop() ,
or
.BR pcap_dispatch() ;
if the code needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.
.PP
.B pcap_next()
reads the next packet (by calling
.B pcap_dispatch()
with a
.I cnt
of 1) and returns a
.I u_char
pointer to the data in that packet.  The
packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
.BR pcap_next_ex() ,
.BR pcap_next() ,
.BR pcap_loop() ,
or
.BR pcap_dispatch() ;
if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it.
The
.I pcap_pkthdr
structure pointed to by
.I h
is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.
.PP
The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
.B pcap_datalink()
routine when handed the
.B pcap_t
value also passed to
.B pcap_loop()
or
.BR pcap_dispatch() .
.I http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
lists the values
.B pcap_datalink()
can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all
packets received unless and until
.B pcap_set_datalink()
is called; after a successful call to
.BR pcap_set_datalink() ,
all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type
specified by the link-layer header type value passed to
.BR pcap_set_datalink() .
.PP
Do
.B NOT
assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
.B DLT_LINUX_SLL
even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_next_ex()
returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0
if packets are being read from a live capture, and the timeout expired,
\-1 if an error occurred while reading the packet, and \-2 if
packets are being read from a ``savefile'', and there are no more
packets to read from the savefile.
If \-1 is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
.PP
.B pcap_next()
returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and returns
.B NULL
if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live
capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't pass
the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a read timeout that
starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before any packets
arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in
non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no
more packets are available in a ``savefile.''  Unfortunately, there is
no way to determine whether an error occurred or not.

.SH NAME
pcap_open_dead, pcap_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision \- open a fake
pcap_t for compiling filters or opening a capture for output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>

.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B pcap_open_dead()
and
.B pcap_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision()
are used for creating a
.B pcap_t
structure to use when calling the other functions in libpcap.  It is
typically used when just using libpcap for compiling BPF code; it can
also be used if using
.BR pcap_dump_open() ,
.BR pcap_dump() ,
and
.B pcap_dump_close()
to write a savefile if there is no
.B pcap_t
that supplies the packets to be written.
.PP
.I linktype
specifies the link-layer type for the
.BR pcap_t .
.PP
.I snaplen
specifies the snapshot length for the
.BR pcap_t .
.PP
When
.BR pcap_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision() ,
is used to create a
.B pcap_t
for use with
.BR pcap_dump_open() ,
.I precision
specifies the time stamp precision for packets;
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO
should be specified if the packets to be written have time stamps in
seconds and microseconds, and
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
should be specified if the packets to be written have time stamps in
seconds and nanoseconds.  Its value does not affect
.BR pcap_compile() .

.SH NAME
pcap_open_live \- open a device for capturing
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ti +8
int promisc, int to_ms, char *errbuf);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_open_live()
is used to obtain a packet capture handle to look
at packets on the network.
.I device
is a string that specifies the network device to open; on Linux systems
with 2.2 or later kernels, a
.I device
argument of "any" or
.B NULL
can be used to capture packets from all interfaces.
.PP
.I snaplen
specifies the snapshot length to be set on the handle.
.PP
.I promisc
specifies if the interface is to be put into promiscuous mode.
.PP
.I to_ms
specifies the read timeout in milliseconds.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_open_live()
returns a
.I pcap_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.I errbuf
may also be set to warning text when
.B pcap_open_live()
succeeds; to detect this case the caller should store a zero-length string in
.I errbuf
before calling
.B pcap_open_live()
and display the warning to the user if
.I errbuf
is no longer a zero-length string.
.I errbuf
is assumed to be able to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.

.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_open_offline()
and
.B pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision()
are called to open a ``savefile'' for reading.
.PP
.I fname
specifies the name of the file to open. The file can have the pcap file
format as described in
.BR pcap-savefile (5@),
which is the file format used by, among other programs,
.BR tcpdump (1)
and
.BR tcpslice (1),
or can have the pcap-ng file format, although not all pcap-ng files can
be read.
The name "-" in a synonym for
.BR stdin .
.PP
.B pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision()
takes an additional
.I precision
argument specifying the time stamp precision desired;
if
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO
is specified, packet time stamps will be supplied in seconds and
microseconds,
and if
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
is specified, packet time stamps will be supplied in seconds and
nanoseconds.  If the time stamps in the file do not have the same
precision as the requested precision, they will be scaled up or down as
necessary before being supplied.
.PP
Alternatively, you may call
.B pcap_fopen_offline()
or
.B pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision()
to read dumped data from an existing open stream
.IR fp .
.B pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision() takes an additional
.I precision
argument as described above.
Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR pcap_open_offline() ,
.BR pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision() ,
.BR pcap_fopen_offline() ,
and
.B pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision()
return a
.I pcap_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.I errbuf
is assumed to be able to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.

.B PCAP_D_IN
will only capture packets received by the device,
.B PCAP_D_OUT
will only capture packets sent by the device and
.B PCAP_D_INOUT
will capture packets received by or sent by the device.
.B PCAP_D_INOUT
is the default setting if this function is not called.
.PP
.B pcap_setdirection()
isn't necessarily fully supported on all platforms; some platforms might
return an error for all values, and some other platforms might not
support

.TH PCAP_SETNONBLOCK 3PCAP "5 April 2008"
.SH NAME
pcap_setnonblock, pcap_getnonblock \- set or get the state of
non-blocking mode on a capture device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.nf
.ft B
char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_setnonblock(pcap_t *p, int nonblock, char *errbuf);
int pcap_getnonblock(pcap_t *p, char *errbuf);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_setnonblock()
puts a capture handle into ``non-blocking'' mode, or takes it out
of ``non-blocking'' mode, depending on whether the
.I nonblock
argument is non-zero or zero.  It has no effect on ``savefiles''.
If there is an error, \-1 is returned and
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message; otherwise, 0 is
returned.
In
``non-blocking'' mode, an attempt to read from the capture descriptor
with
.B pcap_dispatch()
will, if no packets are currently available to be read, return 0
immediately rather than blocking waiting for packets to arrive.
.B pcap_loop()
and
.B pcap_next()
will not work in ``non-blocking'' mode.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_getnonblock()
returns the current ``non-blocking'' state of the capture descriptor; it
always returns 0 on ``savefiles''.
If there is an error, \-1 is returned and
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.PP
.I errbuf
is assumed to be able to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.

.TH PCAP_STATS 3PCAP "7 September 2009"
.SH NAME
pcap_stats \- get capture statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_stats(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_stat *ps);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_stats()
fills in the
.B struct pcap_stat
pointed to by its second argument.  The values represent
packet statistics from the start of the run to the time of the call.
.PP
.B pcap_stats()
is supported only on live captures, not on ``savefiles''; no statistics
are stored in ``savefiles'', so no statistics are available when reading
from a ``savefile''.
.PP
A
.B struct pcap_stat
has the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B ps_recv
number of packets received;
.TP
.B ps_drop
number of packets dropped because there was no room in the operating
system's buffer when they arrived, because packets weren't being read
fast enough;
.TP
.B ps_ifdrop
number of packets dropped by the network interface or its driver.
.RE
.PP
The statistics do not behave the same way on all platforms.
.B ps_recv
might count packets whether they passed any filter set with
.BR pcap_setfilter (3PCAP)
or not, or it might count only packets that pass the filter.
It also might, or might not, count packets dropped because there was no
room in the operating system's buffer when they arrived.
.B ps_drop
is not available on all platforms; it is zero on platforms where it's
not available.  If packet filtering is done in libpcap, rather than in
the operating system, it would count packets that don't pass the filter.
Both
.B ps_recv
and
.B ps_drop
might, or might not, count packets not yet read from the operating
system and thus not yet seen by the application.
.B ps_ifdrop
might, or might not, be implemented; if it's zero, that might mean that
no packets were dropped by the interface, or it might mean that the
statistic is unavailable, so it should not be treated as an indication
that the interface did not drop any packets.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_stats()
returns 0 on success and returns \-1 if there is an error or if
.I p
doesn't support packet statistics.
If \-1 is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBnewpad\fR routine creates and returns a pointer to a new pad data
structure with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns,
\fIncols\fR.
A pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted by the
screen size, and is not necessarily associated with a particular part of the
screen.
Pads can be used when a large window is needed, and only a part of the
window will be on the screen at one time.
Automatic refreshes of pads
(e.g., from scrolling or echoing of input) do not occur.
It is not
legal to call \fBwrefresh\fR with a \fIpad\fR as an argument; the routines
\fBprefresh\fR or \fBpnoutrefresh\fR should be called instead.
Note that these
routines require additional parameters to specify the part of the pad to be
displayed and the location on the screen to be used for the display.
.PP
The \fBsubpad\fR routine creates and returns a pointer to a subwindow within a
pad with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns, \fIncols\fR.
Unlike \fBsubwin\fR, which uses screen coordinates, the window is at position
(\fIbegin\fR_\fIx\fR\fB,\fR \fIbegin\fR_\fIy\fR) on the pad.
The window is
made in the middle of the window \fIorig\fR, so that changes made to one window
affect both windows.
During the use of this routine, it will often be
necessary to call \fBtouchwin\fR or \fBtouchline\fR on \fIorig\fR before
calling \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBprefresh\fR and \fBpnoutrefresh\fR routines are analogous to
\fBwrefresh\fR and \fBwnoutrefresh\fR except that they relate to pads instead
of windows.
The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the
pad and screen are involved.
\fIpminrow\fR and \fIpmincol\fR specify the upper
left-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.
\fIsminrow\fR,
\fIsmincol\fR, \fIsmaxrow\fR, and \fIsmaxcol\fR specify the edges of the
rectangle to be displayed on the screen.
The lower right-hand corner of the
rectangle to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates,
since the rectangles must be the same size.
Both rectangles must be entirely
contained within their respective structures.
Negative values of
\fIpminrow\fR, \fIpmincol\fR, \fIsminrow\fR, or \fIsmincol\fR are treated as if
they were zero.
.PP
The \fBpechochar\fR routine is functionally equivalent to a call to \fBaddch\fR
followed by a call to \fBrefresh\fR, a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call
to \fBwrefresh\fR, or a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call to
\fBprefresh\fR.
The knowledge that only a single character is being output is
taken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a considerable
performance gain might be seen by using these routines instead of their
equivalents.
In the case of \fBpechochar\fR, the last location of the pad on
the screen is reused for the arguments to \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBpecho_wchar\fR function is the analogous wide-character
form of \fBpechochar\fR.
It outputs one character to a pad and immediately refreshes the pad.
It does this by a call to \fBwadd_wch\fR followed by a call to \fBprefresh\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error, and set \fBerrno\fR
to \fBENOMEM\fR.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS
.TP 5
\fBprefresh\fP and \fBpnoutrefresh\fP
return an error
if the window pointer is null, or
if the window is not really a pad or
if the area to refresh extends off-screen or
if the minimum coordinates are greater than the maximum.
.TP 5
\fBpechochar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwechochar\fP returns an error.
.TP 5
\fBpecho_wchar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwecho_wchar\fP returns an error.
.RE
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBpechochar\fR may be a macro.

equivalents.
In the case of \fBpechochar\fR, the last location of the pad on
the screen is reused for the arguments to \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBpecho_wchar\fR function is the analogous wide-character
form of \fBpechochar\fR.
It outputs one character to a pad and immediately refreshes the pad.
It does this by a call to \fBwadd_wch\fR followed by a call to \fBprefresh\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error, and set \fBerrno\fR
to \fBENOMEM\fR.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS
.TP 5
\fBprefresh\fP and \fBpnoutrefresh\fP
return an error
if the window pointer is null, or
if the window is not really a pad or
if the area to refresh extends off-screen or
if the minimum coordinates are greater than the maximum.
.TP 5
\fBpechochar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwechochar\fP returns an error.
.TP 5
\fBpecho_wchar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwecho_wchar\fP returns an error.
.RE
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBpechochar\fR may be a macro.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1PEM\s0 functions read or write structures in \s-1PEM\s0 format. In
this sense \s-1PEM\s0 format is simply base64 encoded data surrounded
by header lines.
.PP
For more details about the meaning of arguments see the
\&\fB\s-1PEM FUNCTION ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section.
.PP
Each operation has four functions associated with it. For
clarity the term "\fBfoobar\fR functions" will be used to collectively
refer to the \fIPEM_read_bio_foobar()\fR, \fIPEM_read_foobar()\fR,
\&\fIPEM_write_bio_foobar()\fR and \fIPEM_write_foobar()\fR functions.
.PP
The \fBPrivateKey\fR functions read or write a private key in
\&\s-1PEM\s0 format using an \s-1EVP_PKEY\s0 structure. The write routines use
\&\*(L"traditional\*(R" private key format and can handle both \s-1RSA\s0 and \s-1DSA\s0
private keys. The read functions can additionally transparently
handle PKCS#8 format encrypted and unencrypted keys too.
.PP
\&\fIPEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey()\fR and \fIPEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey()\fR
write a private key in an \s-1EVP_PKEY\s0 structure in PKCS#8
EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo format using PKCS#5 v2.0 password based encryption
algorithms. The \fBcipher\fR argument specifies the encryption algoritm to
use: unlike all other \s-1PEM\s0 routines the encryption is applied at the
PKCS#8 level and not in the \s-1PEM\s0 headers. If \fBcipher\fR is \s-1NULL\s0 then no
encryption is used and a PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo structure is used instead.
.PP
\&\fIPEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid()\fR and \fIPEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid()\fR
also write out a private key as a PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo however
it uses PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 encryption algorithms instead. The algorithm
to use is specified in the \fBnid\fR parameter and should be the \s-1NID\s0 of the
corresponding \s-1OBJECT IDENTIFIER \s0(see \s-1NOTES\s0 section).
.PP
The \fB\s-1PUBKEY\s0\fR functions process a public key using an \s-1EVP_PKEY\s0
structure. The public key is encoded as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo
structure.
.PP
The \fBRSAPrivateKey\fR functions process an \s-1RSA\s0 private key using an
\&\s-1RSA\s0 structure. It handles the same formats as the \fBPrivateKey\fR
functions but an error occurs if the private key is not \s-1RSA.\s0
.PP
The \fBRSAPublicKey\fR functions process an \s-1RSA\s0 public key using an
\&\s-1RSA\s0 structure. The public key is encoded using a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey
structure.
.PP
The \fB\s-1RSA_PUBKEY\s0\fR functions also process an \s-1RSA\s0 public key using
an \s-1RSA\s0 structure. However the public key is encoded using a
SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public
key is not \s-1RSA.\s0
.PP
The \fBDSAPrivateKey\fR functions process a \s-1DSA\s0 private key using a
\&\s-1DSA\s0 structure. It handles the same formats as the \fBPrivateKey\fR
functions but an error occurs if the private key is not \s-1DSA.\s0
.PP
The \fB\s-1DSA_PUBKEY\s0\fR functions process a \s-1DSA\s0 public key using
a \s-1DSA\s0 structure. The public key is encoded using a
SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public
key is not \s-1DSA.\s0
.PP
The \fBDSAparams\fR functions process \s-1DSA\s0 parameters using a \s-1DSA\s0
structure. The parameters are encoded using a foobar structure.
.PP
The \fBDHparams\fR functions process \s-1DH\s0 parameters using a \s-1DH\s0
structure. The parameters are encoded using a PKCS#3 DHparameter
structure.
.PP
The \fBX509\fR functions process an X509 certificate using an X509
structure. They will also process a trusted X509 certificate but
any trust settings are discarded.
.PP
The \fBX509_AUX\fR functions process a trusted X509 certificate using
an X509 structure.
.PP
The \fBX509_REQ\fR and \fBX509_REQ_NEW\fR functions process a PKCS#10
certificate request using an X509_REQ structure. The \fBX509_REQ\fR
write functions use \fB\s-1CERTIFICATE REQUEST\s0\fR in the header whereas
the \fBX509_REQ_NEW\fR functions use \fB\s-1NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST\s0\fR
(as required by some CAs). The \fBX509_REQ\fR read functions will
handle either form so there are no \fBX509_REQ_NEW\fR read functions.
.PP
The \fBX509_CRL\fR functions process an X509 \s-1CRL\s0 using an X509_CRL
structure.
.PP
The \fB\s-1PKCS7\s0\fR functions process a PKCS#7 ContentInfo using a \s-1PKCS7\s0
structure.
.PP
The \fB\s-1NETSCAPE_CERT_SEQUENCE\s0\fR functions process a Netscape Certificate
Sequence using a \s-1NETSCAPE_CERT_SEQUENCE\s0 structure.
.SH "PEM FUNCTION ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "PEM FUNCTION ARGUMENTS"
The \s-1PEM\s0 functions have many common arguments.
.PP
The \fBbp\fR \s-1BIO\s0 parameter (if present) specifies the \s-1BIO\s0 to read from
or write to.
.PP
The \fBfp\fR \s-1FILE\s0 parameter (if present) specifies the \s-1FILE\s0 pointer to
read from or write to.
.PP
The \s-1PEM\s0 read functions all take an argument \fB\s-1TYPE\s0 **x\fR and return
a \fB\s-1TYPE\s0 *\fR pointer. Where \fB\s-1TYPE\s0\fR is whatever structure the function
uses. If \fBx\fR is \s-1NULL\s0 then the parameter is ignored. If \fBx\fR is not
\&\s-1NULL\s0 but \fB*x\fR is \s-1NULL\s0 then the structure returned will be written
to \fB*x\fR. If neither \fBx\fR nor \fB*x\fR is \s-1NULL\s0 then an attempt is made
to reuse the structure at \fB*x\fR (but see \s-1BUGS\s0 and \s-1EXAMPLES\s0 sections).
Irrespective of the value of \fBx\fR a pointer to the structure is always
returned (or \s-1NULL\s0 if an error occurred).
.PP
The \s-1PEM\s0 functions which write private keys take an \fBenc\fR parameter
which specifies the encryption algorithm to use, encryption is done
at the \s-1PEM\s0 level. If this parameter is set to \s-1NULL\s0 then the private
key is written in unencrypted form.
.PP
The \fBcb\fR argument is the callback to use when querying for the pass
phrase used for encrypted \s-1PEM\s0 structures (normally only private keys).
.PP
For the \s-1PEM\s0 write routines if the \fBkstr\fR parameter is not \s-1NULL\s0 then
\&\fBklen\fR bytes at \fBkstr\fR are used as the passphrase and \fBcb\fR is
ignored.
.PP
If the \fBcb\fR parameters is set to \s-1NULL\s0 and the \fBu\fR parameter is not
\&\s-1NULL\s0 then the \fBu\fR parameter is interpreted as a null terminated string
to use as the passphrase. If both \fBcb\fR and \fBu\fR are \s-1NULL\s0 then the
default callback routine is used which will typically prompt for the
passphrase on the current terminal with echoing turned off.
.PP
The default passphrase callback is sometimes inappropriate (for example
in a \s-1GUI\s0 application) so an alternative can be supplied. The callback
routine has the following form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& int cb(char *buf, int size, int rwflag, void *u);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBbuf\fR is the buffer to write the passphrase to. \fBsize\fR is the maximum
length of the passphrase (i.e. the size of buf). \fBrwflag\fR is a flag
which is set to 0 when reading and 1 when writing. A typical routine
will ask the user to verify the passphrase (for example by prompting
for it twice) if \fBrwflag\fR is 1. The \fBu\fR parameter has the same
value as the \fBu\fR parameter passed to the \s-1PEM\s0 routine. It allows
arbitrary data to be passed to the callback by the application
(for example a window handle in a \s-1GUI\s0 application). The callback
\&\fBmust\fR return the number of characters in the passphrase or 0 if
an error occurred.

.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The old \fBPrivateKey\fR write routines are retained for compatibility.
New applications should write private keys using the
\&\fIPEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey()\fR or \fIPEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey()\fR routines
because they are more secure (they use an iteration count of 2048 whereas
the traditional routines use a count of 1) unless compatibility with older
versions of OpenSSL is important.
.PP
The \fBPrivateKey\fR read routines can be used in all applications because
they handle all formats transparently.
.PP
A frequent cause of problems is attempting to use the \s-1PEM\s0 routines like
this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& X509 *x;
\& PEM_read_bio_X509(bp, &x, 0, NULL);
.Ve
.PP
this is a bug because an attempt will be made to reuse the data at \fBx\fR
which is an uninitialised pointer.
.SH "PEM ENCRYPTION FORMAT"
.IX Header "PEM ENCRYPTION FORMAT"
This old \fBPrivateKey\fR routines use a non standard technique for encryption.
.PP
The private key (or other data) takes the following form:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\& Proc\-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
\& DEK\-Info: DES\-EDE3\-CBC,3F17F5316E2BAC89
\&
\& ...base64 encoded data...
\& \-\-\-\-\-END RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
The line beginning DEK-Info contains two comma separated pieces of information:
the encryption algorithm name as used by \fIEVP_get_cipherbyname()\fR and an 8
byte \fBsalt\fR encoded as a set of hexadecimal digits.
.PP
After this is the base64 encoded encrypted data.
.PP
The encryption key is determined using \fIEVP_BytesToKey()\fR, using \fBsalt\fR and an
iteration count of 1. The \s-1IV\s0 used is the value of \fBsalt\fR and *not* the \s-1IV\s0
returned by \fIEVP_BytesToKey()\fR.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
The \s-1PEM\s0 read routines in some versions of OpenSSL will not correctly reuse
an existing structure. Therefore the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& PEM_read_bio_X509(bp, &x, 0, NULL);
.Ve
.PP
where \fBx\fR already contains a valid certificate, may not work, whereas:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& X509_free(x);
\& x = PEM_read_bio_X509(bp, NULL, 0, NULL);
.Ve
.PP
is guaranteed to work.

.SH NAME
rpc \- library routines for remote procedure calls
.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
These routines allow C programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
First, the client calls a procedure to send a
data packet to the server.
Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine
to perform the requested service, and then sends back a
reply.
Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.
.LP
Routines that are used for Secure RPC (DES authentication) are described in
.BR rpc_secure (3N).
Secure RPC can be used only if DES encryption is available.

Call the remote procedure associated with

.IR versnum ,
and
.I procnum
on the machine,
.IR host .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.B "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.
.IP
Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine
uses
.SM UDP/IP
as a transport; see

This routine creates a

The transport is associated with the socket
.IR sock ,
which may be

in which case a new socket is created.
If the socket is not bound to a local

.SH NAME
rpc \- library routines for remote procedure calls
.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
These routines allow C programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
First, the client calls a procedure to send a
data packet to the server.
Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine
to perform the requested service, and then sends back a
reply.
Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.
.LP
Routines that are used for Secure RPC (DES authentication) are described in
.BR rpc_secure (3N).
Secure RPC can be used only if DES encryption is available.

created;
.I uid
is the user's user
.SM ID ;

.fi
.ft R
.IP
Call the remote procedure associated with
.IR prognum ,
.IR versnum ,
and
.I procnum
on the machine,
.IR host .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.B "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.
.IP
Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine
uses
.SM UDP/IP
as a transport; see
.B clntudp_create(\|)
for restrictions.
You do not have control of timeouts or authentication using
this routine.

Like

except that the remote procedure's output is decoded there;
.I addr
points to the address of the machine that sent the results.
If
.B eachresult(\|)
returns zero,
.B clnt_broadcast(\|)
waits for more replies; otherwise it returns with appropriate
status.

The parameter
.I in

.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc

handle. Destruction usually involves deallocation
of private data structures, including
.I clnt
itself.  Use of
.I clnt
is undefined after calling
.BR clnt_destroy(\|) .

.IP
Generic client creation routine.
.I host
identifies the name of the remote host where the server
is located.
.I proto
indicates which kind of transport protocol to use. The
currently supported values for this field are \(lqudp\(rq
and \(lqtcp\(rq.
Default timeouts are set, but can be modified using
.BR clnt_control(\|) .
.IP
Warning: Using
.SM UDP
has its shortcomings.  Since

.SM RPC
messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes of encoded data,
this transport cannot be used for procedures that take
large arguments or return huge results.

.ft R
.IP
A macro used to change or retrieve various information
about a client object.
.I req
indicates the type of operation, and
.I info
is a pointer to the information. For both
.SM UDP
and
.SM TCP\s0,
the supported values of
.I req
and their argument types and what they do are:
.IP

.ta +2.0i +2.0i +2.0i
.SM CLSET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	set total timeout
.SM CLGET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	get total timeout
.fi
.IP
Note: if you set the timeout using
.BR clnt_control(\|) ,
the timeout parameter passed to

will be ignored in all future calls.
.IP
.nf
.SM CLGET_SERVER_ADDR\s0	struct sockaddr_in 	get server's address

.SH NAME
rpc \- library routines for remote procedure calls
.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
These routines allow C programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
First, the client calls a procedure to send a
data packet to the server.
Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine
to perform the requested service, and then sends back a
reply.
Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.
.LP
Routines that are used for Secure RPC (DES authentication) are described in
.BR rpc_secure (3N).
Secure RPC can be used only if DES encryption is available.

authentication handle that contains
.UX
authentication information.
The parameter
.I host
is the name of the machine on which the information was
created;
.I uid
is the user's user
.SM ID ;
.I gid
is the user's current group
.SM ID ;
.I len
and
.I aup_gids
refer to a counted array of groups to which the user belongs.
It is easy to impersonate a user.

.fi
.ft R
.IP
Call the remote procedure associated with
.IR prognum ,
.IR versnum ,
and
.I procnum
on the machine,
.IR host .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.B "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.
.IP
Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine
uses
.SM UDP/IP
as a transport; see
.B clntudp_create(\|)
for restrictions.
You do not have control of timeouts or authentication using
this routine.

.ft R
.IP
Like
.BR callrpc(\|) ,
except the call message is broadcast to all locally
connected broadcast nets. Each time it receives a
response, this routine calls

.IP
where
.I out
is the same as
.I out
passed to
.BR clnt_broadcast(\|) ,
except that the remote procedure's output is decoded there;
.I addr
points to the address of the machine that sent the results.
If
.B eachresult(\|)
returns zero,
.B clnt_broadcast(\|)
waits for more replies; otherwise it returns with appropriate
status.
.IP
Warning: broadcast sockets are limited in size to the
maximum transfer unit of the data link. For ethernet,
this value is 1500 bytes.

.ft R
.IP
A macro that calls the remote procedure
.I procnum
associated with the client handle,
.IR clnt ,
which is obtained with an
.SM RPC
client creation routine such as
.BR clnt_create(\|) .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results;
.I tout
is the time allowed for results to come back.

.if t .ne 7
.LP
.ft B
.nf
.sp .5
clnt_destroy(clnt)
\s-1CLIENT\s0 *clnt;
.fi
.ft R
.IP
A macro that destroys the client's
.SM RPC
handle. Destruction usually involves deallocation
of private data structures, including
.I clnt
itself.  Use of
.I clnt
is undefined after calling
.BR clnt_destroy(\|) .
If the
.SM RPC
library opened the associated socket, it will close it also.
Otherwise, the socket remains open.

.fi
.ft R
.IP
Generic client creation routine.
.I host
identifies the name of the remote host where the server
is located.
.I proto
indicates which kind of transport protocol to use. The
currently supported values for this field are \(lqudp\(rq
and \(lqtcp\(rq.
Default timeouts are set, but can be modified using
.BR clnt_control(\|) .
.IP
Warning: Using
.SM UDP
has its shortcomings.  Since
.SM UDP\s0-based
.SM RPC
messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes of encoded data,
this transport cannot be used for procedures that take
large arguments or return huge results.

clnt_control(cl, req, info)
\s-1CLIENT\s0 *cl;

.fi
.ft R
.IP
A macro used to change or retrieve various information
about a client object.
.I req
indicates the type of operation, and
.I info
is a pointer to the information. For both
.SM UDP
and
.SM TCP\s0,
the supported values of
.I req
and their argument types and what they do are:
.IP
.nf
.ta +2.0i +2.0i +2.0i
.SM CLSET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	set total timeout
.SM CLGET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	get total timeout
.fi
.IP
Note: if you set the timeout using
.BR clnt_control(\|) ,
the timeout parameter passed to
.B clnt_call(\|)
will be ignored in all future calls.
.IP
.nf
.SM CLGET_SERVER_ADDR\s0	struct sockaddr_in 	get server's address
.fi

.IP
The following operations are valid for
.SM UDP
only:
.IP

.ta +2.0i +2.0i +2.0i
.SM CLSET_RETRY_TIMEOUT\s0		struct timeval	set the retry timeout
.SM CLGET_RETRY_TIMEOUT\s0		struct timeval	get the retry timeout

.ft R
.IP
A macro that frees any data allocated by the
.SM RPC/XDR
system when it decoded the results of an
.SM RPC
call.  The
parameter
.I out
is the address of the results, and

but instead of sending a message to the standard error
indicating why an
.SM RPC
call failed, return a pointer to a string which contains
the message.  The string ends with a
.SM NEWLINE\s0.
.IP
.B clnt_sperrno(\|)
is used instead of
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
if the program does not have a standard error (as a program
running as a server quite likely does not), or if the
programmer
does not want the message to be output with
.BR printf ,
or if a message format different than that supported by
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is to be used.
Note: unlike
.B clnt_sperror(\|)
and

.ft R
.IP
This routine creates a toy
.SM RPC
client for the remote program
.IR prognum ,
version
.IR versnum .
The transport used to pass messages to the service is
actually a buffer within the process's address space, so the
corresponding
.SM RPC
server should live in the same address space; see
.BR svcraw_create(\|) .
This allows simulation of
.SM RPC
and acquisition of
.SM RPC
overheads, such as round trip times, without any
kernel interference. This routine returns
.SM NULL

.SH NAME
rpc \- library routines for remote procedure calls
.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
These routines allow C programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
First, the client calls a procedure to send a
data packet to the server.
Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine
to perform the requested service, and then sends back a
reply.
Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.

.IP
Call the remote procedure associated with

and
.I procnum
on the machine,
.IR host .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.B "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.

This routine creates a toy

transport
is really a buffer within the process's address space,
so the corresponding

address space;
see

This routine creates a

.SM RPC
service transport, to which it returns a pointer.
The transport is associated with the socket
.IR sock ,
which may be
.BR \s-1RPC_ANYSOCK\s0 ,
in which case a new socket is created.
If the socket is not bound to a local
.SM TCP
port, then this routine binds it to an arbitrary port.  Upon
completion,
\fB\%xprt\->xp_sock\fR
is the transport's socket descriptor, and
\fB\%xprt\->xp_port\fR
is the transport's port number.
This routine returns
.SM NULL
if it fails. Since
.SM TCP\s0-based
.SM RPC
uses buffered

users may specify the size of buffers; values of zero
choose suitable defaults.

.SH NAME
rpc \- library routines for remote procedure calls
.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
These routines allow C programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
First, the client calls a procedure to send a
data packet to the server.
Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine
to perform the requested service, and then sends back a
reply.
Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.
.LP
Routines that are used for Secure RPC (DES authentication) are described in
.BR rpc_secure (3N).
Secure RPC can be used only if DES encryption is available.

authentication information.
The parameter
.I host
is the name of the machine on which the information was
created;
.I uid
is the user's user
.SM ID ;

.fi
.ft R
.IP
Call the remote procedure associated with
.IR prognum ,
.IR versnum ,
and
.I procnum
on the machine,
.IR host .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.B "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.B clnt_perrno(\|)
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.
.IP
Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine
uses
.SM UDP/IP
as a transport; see
.B clntudp_create(\|)
for restrictions.
You do not have control of timeouts or authentication using
this routine.

Like

except the call message is broadcast to all locally
connected broadcast nets. Each time it receives a

except that the remote procedure's output is decoded there;
.I addr
points to the address of the machine that sent the results.
If
.B eachresult(\|)
returns zero,
.B clnt_broadcast(\|)
waits for more replies; otherwise it returns with appropriate
status.

.IP
A macro that calls the remote procedure

client creation routine such as
.BR clnt_create(\|) .
The parameter
.I in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.I out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.I inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.I outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results;

.IP
A macro that destroys the client's
.SM RPC
handle. Destruction usually involves deallocation
of private data structures, including
.I clnt
itself.  Use of
.I clnt
is undefined after calling
.BR clnt_destroy(\|) .

library opened the associated socket, it will close it also.
Otherwise, the socket remains open.

.ft R
.IP
Generic client creation routine.
.I host
identifies the name of the remote host where the server
is located.
.I proto
indicates which kind of transport protocol to use. The
currently supported values for this field are \(lqudp\(rq
and \(lqtcp\(rq.
Default timeouts are set, but can be modified using
.BR clnt_control(\|) .
.IP
Warning: Using
.SM UDP
has its shortcomings.  Since
.SM UDP\s0-based
.SM RPC
messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes of encoded data,
this transport cannot be used for procedures that take
large arguments or return huge results.

.ft R
.IP
A macro used to change or retrieve various information
about a client object.
.I req
indicates the type of operation, and
.I info
is a pointer to the information. For both
.SM UDP
and
.SM TCP\s0,
the supported values of
.I req
and their argument types and what they do are:
.IP
.nf
.ta +2.0i +2.0i +2.0i
.SM CLSET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	set total timeout
.SM CLGET_TIMEOUT\s0	struct timeval	get total timeout
.fi
.IP
Note: if you set the timeout using
.BR clnt_control(\|) ,
the timeout parameter passed to
.B clnt_call(\|)
will be ignored in all future calls.
.IP
.nf
.SM CLGET_SERVER_ADDR\s0	struct sockaddr_in 	get server's address

.SM CLSET_RETRY_TIMEOUT\s0		struct timeval	set the retry timeout
.SM CLGET_RETRY_TIMEOUT\s0		struct timeval	get the retry timeout

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBnewpad\fR routine creates and returns a pointer to a new pad data
structure with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns,
\fIncols\fR.
A pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted by the
screen size, and is not necessarily associated with a particular part of the
screen.
Pads can be used when a large window is needed, and only a part of the
window will be on the screen at one time.
Automatic refreshes of pads
(e.g., from scrolling or echoing of input) do not occur.
It is not
legal to call \fBwrefresh\fR with a \fIpad\fR as an argument; the routines
\fBprefresh\fR or \fBpnoutrefresh\fR should be called instead.
Note that these
routines require additional parameters to specify the part of the pad to be
displayed and the location on the screen to be used for the display.
.PP
The \fBsubpad\fR routine creates and returns a pointer to a subwindow within a
pad with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns, \fIncols\fR.
Unlike \fBsubwin\fR, which uses screen coordinates, the window is at position
(\fIbegin\fR_\fIx\fR\fB,\fR \fIbegin\fR_\fIy\fR) on the pad.
The window is
made in the middle of the window \fIorig\fR, so that changes made to one window
affect both windows.
During the use of this routine, it will often be
necessary to call \fBtouchwin\fR or \fBtouchline\fR on \fIorig\fR before
calling \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBprefresh\fR and \fBpnoutrefresh\fR routines are analogous to
\fBwrefresh\fR and \fBwnoutrefresh\fR except that they relate to pads instead
of windows.
The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the
pad and screen are involved.
\fIpminrow\fR and \fIpmincol\fR specify the upper
left-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.
\fIsminrow\fR,
\fIsmincol\fR, \fIsmaxrow\fR, and \fIsmaxcol\fR specify the edges of the
rectangle to be displayed on the screen.
The lower right-hand corner of the
rectangle to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates,
since the rectangles must be the same size.
Both rectangles must be entirely
contained within their respective structures.
Negative values of
\fIpminrow\fR, \fIpmincol\fR, \fIsminrow\fR, or \fIsmincol\fR are treated as if
they were zero.
.PP
The \fBpechochar\fR routine is functionally equivalent to a call to \fBaddch\fR
followed by a call to \fBrefresh\fR, a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call
to \fBwrefresh\fR, or a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call to
\fBprefresh\fR.
The knowledge that only a single character is being output is
taken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a considerable
performance gain might be seen by using these routines instead of their
equivalents.
In the case of \fBpechochar\fR, the last location of the pad on
the screen is reused for the arguments to \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBpecho_wchar\fR function is the analogous wide-character
form of \fBpechochar\fR.
It outputs one character to a pad and immediately refreshes the pad.
It does this by a call to \fBwadd_wch\fR followed by a call to \fBprefresh\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error, and set \fBerrno\fR
to \fBENOMEM\fR.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS
.TP 5
\fBprefresh\fP and \fBpnoutrefresh\fP
return an error
if the window pointer is null, or
if the window is not really a pad or
if the area to refresh extends off-screen or
if the minimum coordinates are greater than the maximum.
.TP 5
\fBpechochar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwechochar\fP returns an error.
.TP 5
\fBpecho_wchar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwecho_wchar\fP returns an error.

.SH NOTES
Note that \fBpechochar\fR may be a macro.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pclose ,
.Nm popen
.Nd process
.Tn I/O
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft FILE *
.Fo popen
.Fa "const char *command"
.Fa "const char *mode"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo pclose
.Fa "FILE *stream"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn popen
function
.Dq opens
a process by creating a bidirectional pipe, forking,
and invoking the shell.
Any streams opened by previous
.Fn popen
calls in the parent process are closed in the new child process.
Historically,
.Fn popen
was implemented with a unidirectional pipe;
hence, many implementations of
.Fn popen
only allow the
.Fa mode
argument to specify reading or writing, not both.
Because
.Fn popen
is now implemented using a bidirectional pipe, the
.Fa mode
argument may request a bidirectional data flow.
The
.Fa mode
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string
which must be
.Ql r
for reading,
.Ql w
for writing, or
.Ql r+
for reading and writing.
.Pp
The
.Fa command
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string
containing a shell command line.
This command is passed to
.Pa /bin/sh ,
using the
.Fl c
flag; interpretation, if any, is performed by the shell.
.Pp
The return value from
.Fn popen
is a normal standard
.Tn I/O
stream in all respects,
save that it must be closed with
.Fn pclose
rather than
.Fn fclose .
Writing to such a stream
writes to the standard input of the command;
the command's standard output is the same as that of the process that called
.Fn popen ,
unless this is altered by the command itself.
Conversely, reading from a
.Dq popened
stream reads the command's standard output, and
the command's standard input is the same as that of the process that called
.Fn popen .
.Pp
Note that output
.Fn popen
streams are fully buffered, by default.
.Pp
The
.Fn pclose
function waits for the associated process to terminate;
it returns the exit status of the command,
as returned by
.Xr wait4 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn popen
function returns
.Dv NULL
if the
.Xr fork 2
or
.Xr pipe 2
calls fail,
or if it cannot allocate memory.
.Pp
The
.Fn pclose
function
returns \-1 if
.Fa stream
is not associated with a
.Dq popened
command, if
.Fa stream
already
.Dq pclosed ,
or if
.Xr wait4 2
returns an error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn popen
function does not reliably set
.Va errno .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr pipe 2 ,
.Xr wait4 2 ,
.Xr fclose 3 ,
.Xr fflush 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr stdio 3 ,
.Xr system 3
.Sh BUGS
Since the standard input of a command opened for reading
shares its seek offset with the process that called
.Fn popen ,
if the original process has done a buffered read,
the command's input position may not be as expected.
Similarly, the output from a command opened for writing
may become intermingled with that of the original process.
The latter can be avoided by calling
.Xr fflush 3
before
.Fn popen .
.Pp
Failure to execute the shell
is indistinguishable from the shell's failure to execute command,
or an immediate exit of the command.
The only hint is an exit status of 127.
.Pp
The
.Fn popen
function
always calls
.Xr sh 1 ,
never calls
.Xr csh 1 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn popen
and a
.Fn pclose
function appeared in
.At v7 .
.Pp
Bidirectional functionality was added in
.Fx 2.2.6 .

\fBform_cursor\fR - position a form window cursor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int pos_form_cursor(FORM *form);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBpos_form_cursor\fR restores the cursor to the position required
for the forms driver to continue processing requests.  This is useful after
\fBcurses\fR routines have been called to do screen-painting in response to a
form operation.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This routine returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_POSTED
The form has not been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fo posix_memalign
.Fa "void **memptr"
.Fa "size_t alignment"
.Fa "size_t size"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes of memory such that the allocation's base address is an exact multiple of
.Fa alignment ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.Fa memptr .
.Pp
The requested
.Fa alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.Pp
Memory that is allocated via
.Fn posix_memalign
can be used as an argument in subsequent calls to
.Xr realloc 3 ,
.Xr reallocf 3 ,
and
.Xr free 3 .
(Note however, that the allocation returned by
.Xr realloc 3 
or
.Xr reallocf 3 
is not guaranteed to preserve the original
.Fa alignment ) .
.Sh NOTES
.Fn posix_memalign
should be used judiciously as the algorithm that realizes the
.Fa alignment
constraint can incur significant memory overhead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise it returns an error value.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa alignment
parameter is not a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Memory allocation error.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose
function adds a close operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is closed as if
.Fn close
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function adds an open operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is opened using the
.Em path ,
.Em oflag ,
and
.Em mode
arguments as if
.Fn open
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.  The string
.Em path
is copied by the
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function during this process, so storage need not be persistent in the
caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2
function adds a dup2 operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em newfiledes
is created as if
.Fn dup2
had been called on
.Em filedes
prior to the new child process starting execution.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np
function adds an abstract inheritance operation to the
list of operations associated with the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The pre-existing descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is marked for inheritance into the new process image, and the
.Em FD_CLOEXEC
flag is cleared from the file descriptor in the new process image.
.Pp
Normally, for
.Xr posix_spawn 2
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 ,
all file descriptors are inherited from the parent process
into the spawned process, except for those explicitly
marked as close-on-exec.  However if the flag
.Em POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT
is set, then during the spawn operation, all pre-existing
file descriptors in the parent process are treated as if they
had been marked close-on-exec i.e. none of them are automatically
inherited.  See
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setflags 3 .
Only file descriptors explicitly manipulated via 
.Em file_actions
are made available in the spawned process. In that case,
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np
can be used to make specific pre-existing file
descriptors from the parent process be
available in the spawned process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er EBADF
The value specified by
.Fa filedes
is negative or would cause the process to exceed the maximum number of
open files it is allowed.
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of
.Fa file_actions
is invalid.
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available to add the new action to

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose
function adds a close operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is closed as if
.Fn close
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function adds an open operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is opened using the
.Em path ,
.Em oflag ,
and
.Em mode
arguments as if
.Fn open
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.  The string
.Em path
is copied by the
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function during this process, so storage need not be persistent in the
caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2
function adds a dup2 operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em newfiledes
is created as if
.Fn dup2
had been called on
.Em filedes
prior to the new child process starting execution.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np
function adds an abstract inheritance operation to the
list of operations associated with the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The pre-existing descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is marked for inheritance into the new process image, and the
.Em FD_CLOEXEC
flag is cleared from the file descriptor in the new process image.
.Pp
Normally, for
.Xr posix_spawn 2
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 ,
all file descriptors are inherited from the parent process
into the spawned process, except for those explicitly
marked as close-on-exec.  However if the flag
.Em POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT
is set, then during the spawn operation, all pre-existing
file descriptors in the parent process are treated as if they
had been marked close-on-exec i.e. none of them are automatically
inherited.  See
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setflags 3 .
Only file descriptors explicitly manipulated via 
.Em file_actions
are made available in the spawned process. In that case,
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np
can be used to make specific pre-existing file
descriptors from the parent process be
available in the spawned process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init
function initializes the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
to an empty set of file actions for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
A
.Em posix_spawn_file_actions_t
object is an opaque type that is used to collect set of file actions
specified by calls to
.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose 3
and
.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen 3
such that once the spawn operation is complete, the child process will
have a different set of file descriptors than the parent, in the order
that the operations were added to the
.Em posix_spawn_file_actions_t .
.Pp
Additionally, any descriptor in the parent not modified by a file action,
and which has the FD_CLOEXEC flag set, will be closed in the child.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
function destroys the object referenced by
.Em file_actions
which was previously intialized by
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init ,
returning any resources obtained at the time of initialization to the
system for subsequent reuse.  A
.Em posix_spawn_file_actions_t
may be reinitialized after having been destroyed, but
.Em must not
be reused after destruction, unless it has been reinitialized.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions will fail and return an error if:
.Bl -tag -width Er

The

function initializes the object referenced by

to an empty set of file actions for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
A
.Em posix_spawn_file_actions_t
object is an opaque type that is used to collect set of file actions
specified by calls to
.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose 3

.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen 3
such that once the spawn operation is complete, the child process will
have a different set of file descriptors than the parent, in the order
that the operations were added to the
.Em posix_spawn_file_actions_t .
.Pp
Additionally, any descriptor in the parent not modified by a file action,
and which has the FD_CLOEXEC flag set, will be closed in the child.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
function destroys the object referenced by
.Em file_actions
which was previously intialized by

.Sh IMPORTANT
These functions represent an Apple extension to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 ,
and as such should not be used by programs intending their code to be
portable to other platforms.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np
function sets the universal binary preferences for the spawn attribute
value referenced by
.Fa attr
from the memory containing the
.Em cpu_type_t
referenced by 
.Fa pref
with a size of
.Fa count
elements; the actual number of elements that are set in the attribute
is returned in
.Fa ocount .
.Pp
When
.Xr spawn 2
or
.Xr spawnp 2
is subsequently invoked on a Universal binary with the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
the elements which were set will be used, in the order they were set,
to select the first element in the list which matches any
.Em cpu_type_t
of those available in the Universal binary.  If there is no match, then
the attempt to create the child process will fail with the error
EBADARCH.
If the
.Em cpu_type_t
.Em CPU_TYPE_ANY
is the last element in the list, then rather than returning
EBADARCH
on no match, the system will instead fall back to the standard Universal
binary grading preference order.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np
function gets the universal binary preferences for the spawn attribute
value referenced by
.Fa attr
into the memory containing the
.Em cpu_type_t
referenced by 
.Fa pref
with a prereserved size of
.Fa count
elements; the actual number of elements that are copied from the attribute
is returned in
.Fa ocount .
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h 
and modify the value of
.Fa ocount .
Additionally, if successful,
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np
will modify the contents of the
.Fa pref
array with the current attribute values.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail if:

The

function sets the
.Fa flags
on the attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
function retrieves the
.Fa flags
on the attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The argument
.Fa flags
is either 0 or a logical OR of one or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
If this bit is set, the child process will inherit the real (rather than the effective) user and
group ID of the parent process. NOTE: This flag has no effect when the set-group bit is set on the
process image being spawned.
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
If this bit is not set, then the child process inherits the parent
process group; if it is set, then the child process will behave as if the
.Xr setpgid 2
function had been called with a
.Fa pid
parameter of 0 and a
.Fa pgid
parameter equal to the value of the spawn-pgroup value of the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
as set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setpgroup 3
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
Signals set to to either be caught or to the default action in the
parent process will also be set to the default action in the child
process.  Signals set to be ignored in the parent process will be
ignored in the child.  However, if this bit is set, then signals in
the
.Em spawn-sigdefault
value of the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
as set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault 3
which are caught or ignored in the parent will instead be reset to
their default actions in the child.

.Sh IMPORTANT
These functions represent an Apple extension to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 ,
and as such should not be used by programs intending their code to be
portable to other platforms.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np
function sets the universal binary preferences for the spawn attribute
value referenced by
.Fa attr
from the memory containing the
.Em cpu_type_t
referenced by 
.Fa pref
with a size of
.Fa count
elements; the actual number of elements that are set in the attribute
is returned in
.Fa ocount .
.Pp
When
.Xr spawn 2
or
.Xr spawnp 2
is subsequently invoked on a Universal binary with the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
the elements which were set will be used, in the order they were set,
to select the first element in the list which matches any
.Em cpu_type_t
of those available in the Universal binary.  If there is no match, then
the attempt to create the child process will fail with the error
EBADARCH.
If the
.Em cpu_type_t
.Em CPU_TYPE_ANY
is the last element in the list, then rather than returning
EBADARCH
on no match, the system will instead fall back to the standard Universal
binary grading preference order.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np
function gets the universal binary preferences for the spawn attribute
value referenced by
.Fa attr
into the memory containing the
.Em cpu_type_t
referenced by 
.Fa pref
with a prereserved size of
.Fa count
elements; the actual number of elements that are copied from the attribute
is returned in
.Fa ocount .
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h 
and modify the value of
.Fa ocount .
Additionally, if successful,
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np
will modify the contents of the
.Fa pref
array with the current attribute values.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

function sets the
.Fa flags
on the attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
function retrieves the
.Fa flags
on the attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The argument
.Fa flags
is either 0 or a logical OR of one or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
If this bit is set, the child process will inherit the real (rather than the effective) user and
group ID of the parent process. NOTE: This flag has no effect when the set-group bit is set on the
process image being spawned.
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
If this bit is not set, then the child process inherits the parent
process group; if it is set, then the child process will behave as if the
.Xr setpgid 2
function had been called with a
.Fa pid
parameter of 0 and a
.Fa pgid
parameter equal to the value of the spawn-pgroup value of the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
as set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setpgroup 3
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
Signals set to to either be caught or to the default action in the
parent process will also be set to the default action in the child
process.  Signals set to be ignored in the parent process will be
ignored in the child.  However, if this bit is set, then signals in
the
.Em spawn-sigdefault
value of the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
as set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault 3
which are caught or ignored in the parent will instead be reset to
their default actions in the child.
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
If this bit is set, then the initial signal mask of the child process will
be set to the
.Em spawn-sigmask
value of the
.Em posix_spawnattr_t ,
as set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setsigmask 3 .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC
.Em Apple Extension :
If this bit is set, rather than returning to the caller,
.Xr posix_spawn 2
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 2
will behave as a more featureful
.Xr execve 2 .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED
.Em Apple Extension :
If this bit is set, then the child process will be created with its task
suspended, permitting debuggers, profilers, and other programs to
manipulate the process before it begins execution in user space.  This
permits, for example, obtaining exact instruction counts, or debugging
very early in
.Xr dyld 1 .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT
.Em Apple Extension :
If this bit is set, then only file descriptors explicitly described by the
.Fa file_actions
argument are available in the spawned process; all
of the other file descriptors are
automatically closed in the spawned process.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h .
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
additionally, upon successful completion, modifies the value pointed to be the

.SH NAME
\fBform_post\fR - write or erase forms from associated subwindows
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int post_form(FORM *form);
.br
int unpost_form(FORM *form);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBpost_form\fR displays a form to its associated subwindow.  To
trigger physical display of the subwindow, use \fBrefresh\fR or some equivalent
\fBcurses\fR routine (the implicit \fBdoupdate\fR triggered by an \fBcurses\fR
input request will do).
.PP
The function \fBunpost_form\fR erases form from its associated subwindow.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_POSTED
The form has not been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to the form.
.TP 5
.B E_NO_ROOM
Form is too large for its window.
.TP 5
.B E_POSTED
The form has already been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

.Fn pow "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double
.Fn powl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn powf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pow
functions compute 
.Fa x
raised to the power
.Fa y .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn pow "0" "y"
returns infinity and raises the "divide-by-zero" floating-point exception for y an odd integer < 0. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "0" "y"
returns +infinity and raises the "divide-by-zero" floating-point exception for y < 0 and not an odd integer. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "0" "y"
returns 0 for y an odd integer > 0. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "0" "y"
returns +0 for y > 0 and not an odd integer. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "-1" "infinity"
returns 1. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "1" "y"
returns 1 for any y, even a NaN. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "0"
returns 1 for any x, even a NaN. 
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "y"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for finite x < 0 and finite non-integer y.
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "-infinity"
returns +infinity for |x| < 1.
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "-infinity"
returns +0 for |x| > 1.
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "+infinity"
returns +0 for |x| < 1.
.Pp
.Fn pow "x" "+infinity"
returns +infinity for |x| > 1.
.Pp
.Fn pow "-infinity" "y"
returns -0 for y an odd integer < 0.
.Pp
.Fn pow "-infinity" "y"
returns +0 for y < 0 and not an odd integer.
.Pp
.Fn pow "-infinity" "y"
returns -infinity for y an odd integer > 0.
.Pp
.Fn pow "-infinity" "y"
returns +infinity for y > 0 and not an odd integer.
.Pp
.Fn pow "+infinity" "y"
returns +0 for y < 0.
.Pp
.Fn pow "+infinity" "y"
returns +infinity for y > 0.
.Pp
A domain error occurs if x is finite and negative and y is finite and not an integer.
.Pp
A domain error can occur if x is 0 and y less than or equal to 0.
.Pp
Range errors may occur.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn pow
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vpowf "vFloat x" "vFloat y" ;
.br
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vpowf "vFloat x" "vSInt32 y" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvpowf "float *z" "const float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvpow "double *z" "const double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.
.Sp
By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST, META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-lib\fR=\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --lib=DIR"
Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR 0.958,\s0 you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4

Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if

.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...

.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target
machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This produces
a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with \s-1PAR\s0.pm and its dependencies installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:"
Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    % pp \-p source.pl                   # makes source.par
\&    % echo "use PAR \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq;" > packed.pl;
\&    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required

Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.
.Sp
By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST\s0, \s-1META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-icon\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i, --icon=FILE"
Specify an icon file (in \fI.ico\fR, \fI.exe\fR or \fI.dll\fR format) for the
executable. This option is ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR
is specified.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR=\fIKEY=VAL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N, --info=KEY=VAL"
Add additional information for the packed file, both in \f(CW\*(C`META.yml\*(C'\fR
and in the executable header (if applicable).  The name/value pair is
joined by \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.  You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-N\*(C'\fR multiple times, or use \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR to
link several pairs.
.Sp
For Win32 executables, these special \f(CW\*(C`KEY\*(C'\fR names are recognized:

Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display the version number and copyrights of this program.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z, --compress=NUMBER"
Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if
\&\fB\-z\fR is not used.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

.SH "NOTES"

Here are some recipes showing how to utilize \fIpp\fR to bundle
\&\fIsource.pl\fR with all its dependencies, on target machines with
different expected settings:
.IP "Stone-alone setup:" 4
.IX Item "Stone-alone setup:"
To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a
machine that doesn't have perl installed:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.exe\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ packed.exe                        # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:" 4
.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target
machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This produces
a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with \s-1PAR\s0.pm and its dependencies installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:"
Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    % pp \-p source.pl                   # makes source.par
\&    % echo "use PAR \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq;" > packed.pl;
\&    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required
.Ve
.PP
Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIpp\fR creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by \s-1PAR\s0, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.
.PP
You may think of \fIpp\fR as "\fIperlcc\fR that works without hassle". :\-)
.PP
A \s-1GUI\s0 interface is also available as the \fItkpp\fR command.
.PP
It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
\&\fIperlcc\fR (however, see \fB\-f\fR below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.
.PP
When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as \f(CW$0\fR (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt open perl script "$0"\*(C'\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options are available in a \fIshort\fR form and a \fIlong\fR form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output output.exe input.pl
\&    % pp \-\-output=output.exe input.pl
.Ve
.PP
Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have \fIpp\fR read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and \f(CW@file\fR options is possible. This is implemented using the
Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-addfile\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --addfile=FILE|DIR"
Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.
.Sp
By default, files are placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    % pp \-a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
\&    % pp \-a "old_dirname;new_dirname"
.Ve
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-addlist\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --addlist=FILE"
Read a list of file/directory names from \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, adding them into the
package.  Each line in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is taken as an argument to \fB\-a\fR above.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bundle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --bundle"
Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is specified.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR\s0 version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths \f(CW@INC\fR before running the contained
script.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C, --clean"
Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --compile"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-cd\fR, \fB\-\-cachedeps\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd, --cachedeps=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to cache detected dependencies. Creates \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR unless
present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent runs.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --dependent"
Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-eval\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --eval=STRING"
Package a one-liner, much the same as \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-evalfeature\fR=\fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --evalfeature=STRING"
Behaves just like \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, except that it implicitly enables all optional features
(in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --execute"
Run \f(CW\*(C`perl inputfile\*(C'\fR to determine additonal run-time dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --exclude=MODULE"
Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except \s-1MANIFEST, META\s0.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will \*(L"use\*(R" the given file at runtime.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --filter=FILTER"
Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.
.Sp
If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % pp \-f Bleach source.pl
.Ve
.Sp
If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should have
a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you
understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g, --gui"
Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non\-MSWin32 platforms or when \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Show basic usage information.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-lib\fR=\fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --lib=DIR"
Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR|\fI\s-1LIBRARY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY"
Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or \s-1DLL\s0) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l ncurses\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-l libncurses.so\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\*(C'\fR in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --log=FILE"
Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-modfilter\fR=\fIFILTER[=REGEX]\fR," 4
.IX Item "-F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],"
Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters.
.Sp
By default, the \fIPodStrip\fR filter is applied.  In case
that causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PAR_VERBATIM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1PAR 0.958,\s0 you can use an optional regular expression (\fI\s-1REGEX\s0\fR above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pp \-o foo.exe \-F Bleach=warnings\e.pm$ foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a binary executable \fIfoo.exe\fR from \fIfoo.pl\fR packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in \f(CW\*(C`warnings.pm\*(C'\fR which are filtered with
PAR::Filter::Bleach.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M, --module=MODULE"
Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the \f(CW@INC\fR path; i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\-M
Module::ScanDeps\*(C'\fR means the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`\-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR has an extension that is not \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.ix\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`/lib/\*(C'\fR inside the \s-1PAR\s0 file.  This use is deprecated \*(-- consider using
the \fB\-a\fR option instead.
.Sp
You may specify \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --multiarch"
Build a multi-architecture \s-1PAR\s0 file.  Implies \fB\-p\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noscan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noscan"
Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-x\fR exclusively.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --output=FILE"
File name for the final packaged executable.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-par\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --par"
Create \s-1PAR\s0 archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perlscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --perlscript"
Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --run"
Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.
.IP "\fB\-\-reusable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reusable"
\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0\fR
.Sp
Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary, external
Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  pp \-o myapp \-\-reusable someapp.pl
\&  ./myapp \-\-par\-options \-\-reuse otherapp.pl
.Ve
.Sp
The second line will run \fIotherapp.pl\fR instead of \fIsomeapp.pl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --save"
Do not delete generated \s-1PAR\s0 file after packaging.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --sign"
Cryptographically sign the generated \s-1PAR\s0 or binary file using
Module::Signature.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tempcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T, --tempcache"
Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without \-C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.
.Sp
When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
\&\fI/tmp/par\-USERNAME/cache\-XXXXXXX\fR.  \fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR is replaced by the
user running the program, and \fI\s-1XXXXXXX\s0\fR is either a hash of the
executable or the value passed to the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-tempcache\*(C'\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose[=NUMBER]"
Increase verbosity of output; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW3\fR,
\&\f(CW3\fR being the most verbose.  Defaults to \f(CW1\fR if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, \fB\-vv\fR sets verbose level to \f(CW2\fR, and \fB\-vvv\fR
sets it to \f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display the version number and copyrights of this program.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z, --compress=NUMBER"
Set zip compression level; \fI\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR is an integer from \f(CW0\fR to \f(CW9\fR,
\&\f(CW0\fR = no compression, \f(CW9\fR = max compression.  Defaults to \f(CW6\fR if
\&\fB\-z\fR is not used.

Here are some recipes showing how to utilize \fIpp\fR to bundle
\&\fIsource.pl\fR with all its dependencies, on target machines with
different expected settings:
.IP "Stone-alone setup:" 4
.IX Item "Stone-alone setup:"
To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a
machine that doesn't have perl installed:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.exe\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ packed.exe                        # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:" 4
.IX Item "Perl interpreter only, without core modules:"
To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable
for running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where
you want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that
your program uses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-B \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with core modules installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with core modules installed:"
To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target
machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This produces
a significantly smaller file than the previous version:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    % pp \-P \-o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it
.Ve
.IP "Perl with \s-1PAR\s0.pm and its dependencies installed:" 4
.IX Item "Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:"
Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target machine.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    % pp \-p source.pl                   # makes source.par
\&    % echo "use PAR \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq;" > packed.pl;
\&    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
\&    # Now, deploy \*(Aqsource.par\*(Aq and \*(Aqpacked.pl\*(Aq to target machine...
\&    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required
.Ve
.PP
Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
\&'Stand\-alone executable' above will \fInot\fR need a separate \fIperl5x.dll\fR
or \fIlibperl.so\fR to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
underlying system libraries such as \fIlibc\fR must be compatible between
the host and target machines.  Use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dependent\*(C'\fR if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.

structure with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns,
\fIncols\fR.
A pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted by the
screen size, and is not necessarily associated with a particular part of the
screen.
Pads can be used when a large window is needed, and only a part of the
window will be on the screen at one time.
Automatic refreshes of pads
(e.g., from scrolling or echoing of input) do not occur.
It is not
legal to call \fBwrefresh\fR with a \fIpad\fR as an argument; the routines
\fBprefresh\fR or \fBpnoutrefresh\fR should be called instead.
Note that these
routines require additional parameters to specify the part of the pad to be
displayed and the location on the screen to be used for the display.
.PP
The \fBsubpad\fR routine creates and returns a pointer to a subwindow within a
pad with the given number of lines, \fInlines\fR, and columns, \fIncols\fR.
Unlike \fBsubwin\fR, which uses screen coordinates, the window is at position
(\fIbegin\fR_\fIx\fR\fB,\fR \fIbegin\fR_\fIy\fR) on the pad.
The window is
made in the middle of the window \fIorig\fR, so that changes made to one window
affect both windows.
During the use of this routine, it will often be
necessary to call \fBtouchwin\fR or \fBtouchline\fR on \fIorig\fR before
calling \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBprefresh\fR and \fBpnoutrefresh\fR routines are analogous to
\fBwrefresh\fR and \fBwnoutrefresh\fR except that they relate to pads instead
of windows.
The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the
pad and screen are involved.
\fIpminrow\fR and \fIpmincol\fR specify the upper
left-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.
\fIsminrow\fR,
\fIsmincol\fR, \fIsmaxrow\fR, and \fIsmaxcol\fR specify the edges of the
rectangle to be displayed on the screen.
The lower right-hand corner of the
rectangle to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates,
since the rectangles must be the same size.
Both rectangles must be entirely
contained within their respective structures.
Negative values of
\fIpminrow\fR, \fIpmincol\fR, \fIsminrow\fR, or \fIsmincol\fR are treated as if
they were zero.
.PP
The \fBpechochar\fR routine is functionally equivalent to a call to \fBaddch\fR
followed by a call to \fBrefresh\fR, a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call
to \fBwrefresh\fR, or a call to \fBwaddch\fR followed by a call to
\fBprefresh\fR.
The knowledge that only a single character is being output is
taken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a considerable
performance gain might be seen by using these routines instead of their
equivalents.
In the case of \fBpechochar\fR, the last location of the pad on
the screen is reused for the arguments to \fBprefresh\fR.
.PP
The \fBpecho_wchar\fR function is the analogous wide-character
form of \fBpechochar\fR.
It outputs one character to a pad and immediately refreshes the pad.
It does this by a call to \fBwadd_wch\fR followed by a call to \fBprefresh\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error, and set \fBerrno\fR
to \fBENOMEM\fR.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS
.TP 5
\fBprefresh\fP and \fBpnoutrefresh\fP
return an error
if the window pointer is null, or
if the window is not really a pad or
if the area to refresh extends off-screen or
if the minimum coordinates are greater than the maximum.
.TP 5
\fBpechochar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwechochar\fP returns an error.
.TP 5
\fBpecho_wchar\fP
returns an error
if the window is not really a pad, and the associated call
to \fBwecho_wchar\fP returns an error.

write output to
.Dv stdout ,
the standard output stream;
.Fn fprintf
and
.Fn vfprintf
write output to the given output
.Fa stream ;
.Fn dprintf
and
.Fn vdprintf
write output to the given file descriptor;
.Fn sprintf ,
.Fn snprintf ,
.Fn vsprintf ,
and
.Fn vsnprintf
write to the character string
.Fa str ;
and
.Fn asprintf
and
.Fn vasprintf
dynamically allocate a new string with
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Pp
Extended locale versions of these functions are documented in
.Xr printf_l 3 .
See
.Xr xlocale 3
for more information.
.Pp
These functions write the output under the control of a
.Fa format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments
(or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of
.Xr stdarg 3 )
are converted for output.
.Pp
The
.Fn asprintf
and
.Fn vasprintf
functions
set
.Fa *ret
to be a pointer to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the formatted string.
This pointer should be passed to
.Xr free 3
to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed.
If sufficient space cannot be allocated,
.Fn asprintf
and
.Fn vasprintf
will return \-1 and set
.Fa ret
to be a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.Pp
The
.Fn snprintf
and
.Fn vsnprintf
functions
will write at most
.Fa size Ns \-1
of the characters printed into the output string
(the
.Fa size Ns 'th
character then gets the terminating
.Ql \e0 ) ;
if the return value is greater than or equal to the
.Fa size
argument, the string was too short
and some of the printed characters were discarded.
The output is always null-terminated, unless
.Fa size
is 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn sprintf
and
.Fn vsprintf
functions
effectively assume a
.Fa size
of
.Dv INT_MAX + 1.
.Pp
For those routines that write to a user-provided character string,
that string and the format strings should not overlap, as the
behavior is undefined.
.Pp
The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary
.\" multibyte
characters (not
.Cm % ) ,
which are copied unchanged to the output stream;
and conversion specifications, each of which results
in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by
the
.Cm %
character.
The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion)
with the conversion specifier.
After the
.Cm % ,
the following appear in sequence:
.Bl -bullet
.It
An optional field, consisting of a decimal digit string followed by a
.Cm $ ,
specifying the next argument to access.
If this field is not provided, the argument following the last
argument accessed will be used.
Arguments are numbered starting at
.Cm 1 .
If unaccessed arguments in the format string are interspersed with ones that
are accessed the results will be indeterminate.
.It
Zero or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width ".So \  Sc (space)"
.It Sq Cm #
The value should be converted to an
.Dq alternate form .
For
.Cm c , d , i , n , p , s ,
and
.Cm u
conversions, this option has no effect.
For
.Cm o
conversions, the precision of the number is increased to force the first
character of the output string to a zero.
For
.Cm x
and
.Cm X
conversions, a non-zero result has the string
.Ql 0x
(or
.Ql 0X
for
.Cm X
conversions) prepended to it.
For
.Cm a , A , e , E , f , F , g ,
and
.Cm G
conversions, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no
digits follow it (normally, a decimal point appears in the results of
those conversions only if a digit follows).
For
.Cm g
and
.Cm G
conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they
would otherwise be.
.It So Cm 0 Sc (zero)
Zero padding.
For all conversions except
.Cm n ,
the converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.
If a precision is given with a numeric conversion
.Cm ( d , i , o , u , i , x ,
and
.Cm X ) ,
the
.Cm 0
flag is ignored.
.It Sq Cm \-
A negative field width flag;
the converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
Except for
.Cm n
conversions, the converted value is padded on the right with blanks,
rather than on the left with blanks or zeros.
A
.Cm \-
overrides a
.Cm 0
if both are given.
.It So "\ " Sc (space)
A blank should be left before a positive number
produced by a signed conversion
.Cm ( a , A , d , e , E , f , F , g , G ,
or
.Cm i ) .
.It Sq Cm +
A sign must always be placed before a
number produced by a signed conversion.
A
.Cm +
overrides a space if both are used.
.It So "'" Sc (apostrophe)
Decimal conversions
.Cm ( d , u ,
or
.Cm i )
or the integral portion of a floating point conversion
.Cm ( f
or
.Cm F )
should be grouped and separated by thousands using
the non-monetary separator returned by
.Xr localeconv 3 .
.El
.It
An optional separator character (
.Cm \ , | \;  | \ : | _
) used for separating multiple values when printing an AltiVec or SSE vector,
or other multi-value unit.
.Pp
NOTE: This is an extension to the
.Fn printf
specification.
Behaviour of these values for
.Fn printf 
is only defined for operating systems conforming to the 
AltiVec Technology Programming Interface Manual.
(At time of writing this includes only Mac OS X 10.2 and later.)
.It
An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width.
If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it will
be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
flag has been given) to fill out
the field width.
.It
An optional precision, in the form of a period
.Cm \&.
followed by an
optional digit string.
If the digit string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
.Cm d , i , o , u , x ,
and
.Cm X
conversions, the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point for
.Cm a , A , e , E , f ,
and
.Cm F
conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for
.Cm g
and
.Cm G
conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a
string for
.Cm s
conversions.
.It
An optional length modifier, that specifies the size of the argument.
The following length modifiers are valid for the
.Cm d , i , n , o , u , x ,
or
.Cm X
conversion:
.Bl -column ".Cm q Em (deprecated)" ".Vt signed char" ".Vt unsigned long long" ".Vt long long *"
.It Sy Modifier Ta Cm d , i Ta Cm o , u , x , X Ta Cm n
.It Cm hh Ta Vt "signed char" Ta Vt "unsigned char" Ta Vt "signed char *"
.It Cm h Ta Vt short Ta Vt "unsigned short" Ta Vt "short *"
.It Cm l No (ell) Ta Vt long Ta Vt "unsigned long" Ta Vt "long *"
.It Cm ll No (ell ell) Ta Vt "long long" Ta Vt "unsigned long long" Ta Vt "long long *"
.It Cm j Ta Vt intmax_t Ta Vt uintmax_t Ta Vt "intmax_t *"
.It Cm t Ta Vt ptrdiff_t Ta (see note) Ta Vt "ptrdiff_t *"
.It Cm z Ta (see note) Ta Vt size_t Ta (see note)
.It Cm q Em (deprecated) Ta Vt quad_t Ta Vt u_quad_t Ta Vt "quad_t *"
.El
.Pp
Note:
the
.Cm t
modifier, when applied to a
.Cm o , u , x ,
or
.Cm X
conversion, indicates that the argument is of an unsigned type
equivalent in size to a
.Vt ptrdiff_t .
The
.Cm z
modifier, when applied to a
.Cm d
or
.Cm i
conversion, indicates that the argument is of a signed type equivalent in
size to a
.Vt size_t .
Similarly, when applied to an
.Cm n
conversion, it indicates that the argument is a pointer to a signed type
equivalent in size to a
.Vt size_t .
.Pp
The following length modifier is valid for the
.Cm a , A , e , E , f , F , g ,
or
.Cm G
conversion:
.Bl -column ".Sy Modifier" ".Cm a , A , e , E , f , F , g , G"
.It Sy Modifier Ta Cm a , A , e , E , f , F , g , G
.It Cm l No (ell) Ta Vt double
(ignored, same behavior as without it)
.It Cm L Ta Vt "long double"
.El
.Pp
The following length modifier is valid for the
.Cm c
or
.Cm s
conversion:
.Bl -column ".Sy Modifier" ".Vt wint_t" ".Vt wchar_t *"
.It Sy Modifier Ta Cm c Ta Cm s
.It Cm l No (ell) Ta Vt wint_t Ta Vt "wchar_t *"
.El
.Pp
The AltiVec Technology Programming Interface Manual also defines five additional length modifiers
which can be used (in place of the conventional length modifiers) for the printing of AltiVec or SSE vectors:
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Cm v
Treat the argument as a vector value, unit length will be determined by the conversion
specifier (default = 16 8-bit units for all integer conversions, 
4 32-bit units for floating point conversions).
.It Cm vh, hv
Treat the argument as a vector of 8 16-bit units.
.It Cm vl, lv
Treat the argument as a vector of 4 32-bit units.
.El
.Pp
NOTE: The vector length specifiers are extensions to the
.Fn printf
specification.
Behaviour of these values for
.Fn printf 
is only defined for operating systems conforming to the 
AltiVec Technology Programming Interface Manual.
(At time of writing this includes only Mac OS X 10.2 and later.)
.Pp
As a further extension, for SSE2 64-bit units:
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Cm vll, llv
Treat the argument as a vector of 2 64-bit units.
.El
.It
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
.El
.Pp
A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by
an asterisk
.Ql *
or an asterisk followed by one or more decimal digits and a
.Ql $
instead of a
digit string.
In this case, an
.Vt int
argument supplies the field width or precision.
A negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag followed by a
positive field width; a negative precision is treated as though it were
missing.
If a single format directive mixes positional
.Pq Li nn$
and non-positional arguments, the results are undefined.
.Pp
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm diouxX"
.It Cm diouxX
The
.Vt int
(or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal
.Cm ( d
and
.Cm i ) ,
unsigned octal
.Pq Cm o ,
unsigned decimal
.Pq Cm u ,
or unsigned hexadecimal
.Cm ( x
and
.Cm X )
notation.
The letters
.Dq Li abcdef
are used for
.Cm x
conversions; the letters
.Dq Li ABCDEF
are used for
.Cm X
conversions.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on
the left with zeros.
.It Cm DOU
The
.Vt "long int"
argument is converted to signed decimal, unsigned octal, or unsigned
decimal, as if the format had been
.Cm ld , lo ,
or
.Cm lu
respectively.
These conversion characters are deprecated, and will eventually disappear.
.It Cm eE
The
.Vt double
argument is rounded and converted in the style
.Sm off
.Oo \- Oc Ar d Li \&. Ar ddd Li e \(+- Ar dd
.Sm on
where there is one digit before the
decimal-point character
and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision;
if the precision is missing,
it is taken as 6; if the precision is
zero, no decimal-point character appears.
An
.Cm E
conversion uses the letter
.Ql E
(rather than
.Ql e )
to introduce the exponent.
The exponent always contains at least two digits; if the value is zero,
the exponent is 00.
.Pp
For
.Cm a , A , e , E , f , F , g ,
and
.Cm G
conversions, positive and negative infinity are represented as
.Li inf
and
.Li -inf
respectively when using the lowercase conversion character, and
.Li INF
and
.Li -INF
respectively when using the uppercase conversion character.
Similarly, NaN is represented as
.Li nan
when using the lowercase conversion, and
.Li NAN
when using the uppercase conversion.
.It Cm fF
The
.Vt double
argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation in the style
.Sm off
.Oo \- Oc Ar ddd Li \&. Ar ddd ,
.Sm on
where the number of digits after the decimal-point character
is equal to the precision specification.
If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is
explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.
If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
.It Cm gG
The
.Vt double
argument is converted in style
.Cm f
or
.Cm e
(or
.Cm F
or
.Cm E
for
.Cm G
conversions).
The precision specifies the number of significant digits.
If the precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision is zero,
it is treated as 1.
Style
.Cm e
is used if the exponent from its conversion is less than \-4 or greater than
or equal to the precision.
Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional part of the result; a
decimal point appears only if it is followed by at least one digit.
.It Cm aA
The
.Vt double
argument is rounded and converted to hexadecimal notation in the style
.Sm off
.Oo \- Oc Li 0x Ar h Li \&. Ar hhhp Oo \(+- Oc Ar d ,
.Sm on
where the number of digits after the hexadecimal-point character
is equal to the precision specification.
If the precision is missing, it is taken as enough to represent
the floating-point number exactly, and no rounding occurs.
If the precision is zero, no hexadecimal-point character appears.
The
.Cm p
is a literal character
.Ql p ,
and the exponent consists of a positive or negative sign
followed by a decimal number representing an exponent of 2.
The
.Cm A
conversion uses the prefix
.Dq Li 0X
(rather than
.Dq Li 0x ) ,
the letters
.Dq Li ABCDEF
(rather than
.Dq Li abcdef )
to represent the hex digits, and the letter
.Ql P
(rather than
.Ql p )
to separate the mantissa and exponent.
.Pp
Note that there may be multiple valid ways to represent floating-point
numbers in this hexadecimal format.
For example,
.Li 0x1.92p+1 , 0x3.24p+0 , 0x6.48p-1 ,
and
.Li 0xc.9p-2
are all equivalent.
The format chosen depends on the internal representation of the
number, but the implementation guarantees that the length of the
mantissa will be minimized.
Zeroes are always represented with a mantissa of 0 (preceded by a
.Ql -
if appropriate) and an exponent of
.Li +0 .
.It Cm C
Treated as
.Cm c
with the
.Cm l
(ell) modifier.
.It Cm c
The
.Vt int
argument is converted to an
.Vt "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.Pp
If the
.Cm l
(ell) modifier is used, the
.Vt wint_t
argument shall be converted to a
.Vt wchar_t ,
and the (potentially multi-byte) sequence representing the
single wide character is written, including any shift sequences.
If a shift sequence is used, the shift state is also restored
to the original state after the character.
.It Cm S
Treated as
.Cm s
with the
.Cm l
(ell) modifier.
.It Cm s
The
.Vt "char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating
.Dv NUL
character;
if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are
written.
If a precision is given, no null character
need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than
the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating
.Dv NUL
character.
.Pp
If the
.Cm l
(ell) modifier is used, the
.Vt "wchar_t *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide characters
(pointer to a wide string).
For each wide character in the string, the (potentially multi-byte)
sequence representing the
wide character is written, including any shift sequences.
If any shift sequence is used, the shift state is also restored
to the original state after the string.
Wide characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating wide
.Dv NUL
character;
if a precision is specified, no more than the number of bytes specified are
written (including shift sequences).
Partial characters are never written.
If a precision is given, no null character
need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than
the number of bytes required to render the multibyte representation of
the string, the array must contain a terminating wide
.Dv NUL
character.
.It Cm p
The
.Vt "void *"
pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by
.Ql %#x
or
.Ql %#lx ) .
.It Cm n
The number of characters written so far is stored into the
integer indicated by the
.Vt "int *"
(or variant) pointer argument.
No argument is converted.
.It Cm %
A
.Ql %
is written.
No argument is converted.
The complete conversion specification
is
.Ql %% .
.El
.Pp
The decimal point
character is defined in the program's locale (category
.Dv LC_NUMERIC ) .
.Pp
In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of
a numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
width, the
field is expanded to contain the conversion result.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the number of characters printed
(not including the trailing
.Ql \e0
used to end output to strings),
except for
.Fn snprintf
and
.Fn vsnprintf ,
which return the number of characters that would have been printed if the
.Fa size
were unlimited
(again, not including the final
.Ql \e0 ) .
These functions return a negative value if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To print a date and time in the form
.Dq Li "Sunday, July 3, 10:02" ,
where
.Fa weekday
and
.Fa month
are pointers to strings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <stdio.h>
fprintf(stdout, "%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\en",
	weekday, month, day, hour, min);
.Ed
.Pp
To print \*(Pi
to five decimal places:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
fprintf(stdout, "pi = %.5f\en", 4 * atan(1.0));
.Ed
.Pp
To allocate a 128 byte string and print into it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
char *newfmt(const char *fmt, ...)
{
	char *p;
	va_list ap;
	if ((p = malloc(128)) == NULL)
		return (NULL);
	va_start(ap, fmt);
	(void) vsnprintf(p, 128, fmt, ap);
	va_end(ap);
	return (p);
}
.Ed
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The conversion formats
.Cm \&%D , \&%O ,
and
.Cm \&%U
are not standard and
are provided only for backward compatibility.
The effect of padding the
.Cm %p
format with zeros (either by the
.Cm 0
flag or by specifying a precision), and the benign effect (i.e., none)
of the
.Cm #
flag on
.Cm %n
and
.Cm %p
conversions, as well as other
nonsensical combinations such as
.Cm %Ld ,
are not standard; such combinations
should be avoided.
.Sh ERRORS
In addition to the errors documented for the
.Xr write 2
system call, the
.Fn printf
family of functions may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid wide character code was encountered.

conform to

.Sh HISTORY
The functions
.Fn asprintf
and
.Fn vasprintf
first appeared in the
.Tn GNU C
library.
These were implemented by
.An Peter Wemm Aq Mt peter@FreeBSD.org
in
.Fx 2.2 ,
but were later replaced with a different implementation
from
.Ox 2.3
by
.An Todd C. Miller Aq Mt Todd.Miller@courtesan.com .
The
.Fn dprintf
and
.Fn vdprintf
functions were added in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
family of functions do not correctly handle multibyte characters in the
.Fa format
argument.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The
.Fn sprintf
and
.Fn vsprintf
functions are easily misused in a manner which enables malicious users
to arbitrarily change a running program's functionality through
a buffer overflow attack.
Because
.Fn sprintf
and
.Fn vsprintf
assume an infinitely long string,
callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space;
this is often hard to assure.
For safety, programmers should use the
.Fn snprintf
interface instead.
For example:
.Bd -literal
void
foo(const char *arbitrary_string, const char *and_another)
{
	char onstack[8];

#ifdef BAD
	/*
	 * This first sprintf is bad behavior.  Do not use sprintf!
	 */
	sprintf(onstack, "%s, %s", arbitrary_string, and_another);
#else
	/*
	 * The following two lines demonstrate better use of
	 * snprintf().
	 */
	snprintf(onstack, sizeof(onstack), "%s, %s", arbitrary_string,
	    and_another);
#endif
}
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn printf
and
.Fn sprintf
family of functions are also easily misused in a manner
allowing malicious users to arbitrarily change a running program's
functionality by either causing the program
to print potentially sensitive data
.Dq "left on the stack" ,
or causing it to generate a memory fault or bus error
by dereferencing an invalid pointer.
.Pp
.Cm %n
can be used to write arbitrary data to potentially carefully-selected
addresses.
Programmers are therefore strongly advised to never pass untrusted strings
as the
.Fa format
argument, as an attacker can put format specifiers in the string
to mangle your stack,
leading to a possible security hole.
This holds true even if the string was built using a function like
.Fn snprintf ,
as the resulting string may still contain user-supplied conversion specifiers
for later interpolation by
.Fn printf .
.Pp
Always use the proper secure idiom:
.Pp
.Dl "snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \*q%s\*q, string);"

\fBprintw\fR,
\fBwprintw\fR,
\fBmvprintw\fR,
\fBmvwprintw\fR,
\fBvwprintw\fR, \fBvw_printw\fR - print formatted output in \fBcurses\fR windows
.ad
.hy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint printw(const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint wprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvprintw(int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...);\fR

.br
\fBint vwprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.br
\fBint vw_printw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBprintw\fR, \fBwprintw\fR, \fBmvprintw\fR and \fBmvwprintw\fR
routines are analogous to \fBprintf\fR [see \fBprintf\fR(3)].  In
effect, the string that would be output by \fBprintf\fR is output
instead as though \fBwaddstr\fR were used on the given window.
.PP
The \fBvwprintw\fR and \fBwv_printw\fR routines are analogous
to \fBvprintf\fR [see \fBprintf\fR(3)]
and perform a \fBwprintw\fR using a variable argument list.
The third argument is a \fBva_list\fR, a pointer to a
list of arguments, as defined in \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
an error may be returned if it cannot allocate enough memory for the
buffer used to format the results.
It will return an error if the window pointer is null.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The function
\fBvwprintw\fR is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function
\fBvw_printw\fR using the \fB<stdarg.h>\fR interface.
The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that
\fBvw_printw\fR  is preferred to \fBvwprintw\fR since the latter requires
including \fB<varargs.h>\fR, which
cannot be used in the same file as \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
This implementation uses \fB<stdarg.h>\fR for both, because that header
is included in \fB<curses.h\fR>.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fo pselect
.Fa "int nfds"
.Fa "fd_set *restrict readfds"
.Fa "fd_set *restrict writefds"
.Fa "fd_set *restrict errorfds"

.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pselect
function was introduced by
.St -p1003.1g-2000
as a slightly stronger version of
.Xr select 2 .
The
.Fa nfds , readfds , writefds ,
and
.Fa errorfds
arguments are all identical to the analogous arguments of
.Fn select .
The
.Fa timeout
argument in
.Fn pselect
points to a
.Vt "const struct timespec" ,
rather than the (modifiable)
.Vt "struct timeval"
used by
.Fn select ;
as in
.Fn select ,
a null pointer may be passed to indicate that
.Fn pselect
should wait indefinitely.
Finally,
.Fa sigmask
specifies a signal mask which is set while waiting for input.
When
.Fn pselect
returns, the original signal mask is restored.
.Pp
See
.Xr select 2
for a more detailed discussion of the semantics of this interface, and
for macros used to manipulate the
.Vt "fd_set"
data type.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fn pselect
function is implemented in the C library as a wrapper around
.Fn select .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pselect
function returns the same values and under the same conditions as
.Fn select .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pselect
function may fail for any of the reasons documented for
.Xr select 2
and (if a signal mask is provided)
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kqueue 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn pselect
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn pselect
function first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Fn pselect
function and this manual page were written by

.Sh LIBRARY

.In string.h

.Fn strsignal "int sig"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn psignal
and
.Fn strsignal
functions locate the descriptive message
string for a signal number.
.Pp
The
.Fn strsignal
function accepts a signal number argument
.Fa sig
and returns a pointer to the corresponding message string.
.Pp
The
.Fn psignal
function accepts a signal number argument
.Fa sig
and writes it to the standard error.
If the argument
.Fa s
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL
and does not point to the null character,
.Fa s
is written to the standard error file descriptor
prior to the message string,
immediately followed by a colon and a space.
If the signal number is not recognized
.Pq Xr sigaction 2 ,
the string
.Dq "Unknown signal
is produced.
.Pp
The message strings can be accessed directly
through the external array
.Va sys_siglist ,
indexed by recognized signal numbers.
The external array
.Va sys_signame
is used similarly and
contains short, lower-case abbreviations for signals
which are useful for recognizing signal names
in user input.
The defined variable
.Dv NSIG
contains a count of the strings in
.Va sys_siglist
and
.Va sys_signame .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn strsignal
a pointer to the desired message or a NULL value indicating an error.  This
string is not to be freed by the caller.  Beginning with Mac OSX 10.7, this
string is unique to each thread.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn strsignal
will fail and no additional memory will be allocated if
one of the following are true:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to allocate storage space for the return value in the running thread.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn psort ,
.Fn psort_b ,
and
.Fn psort_r
functions are parallel sort routines that are drop-in compatible with the
corresponding
.Fn qsort
function (see
.Xr qsort 3
for a description of the arguments).
On multiprocessor machines, multiple threads may be created to simultaneously
perform the sort calculations, resulting in an overall faster sort result.
Overhead in managing the threads limits the maximum speed improvement to
somewhat less that the number of processors available.
For example, on a 4-processor machine, a typical sort on a large array might
result in 3.2 times faster sorting than a regular
.Fn qsort .
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
Because of the multi-threaded nature of the sort, the comparison function
is expected to perform its own synchronization that might be required for
data physically
.Em outside
the two objects passed to the comparison function.
However, no synchronization is required for the two
object themselves, unless some third party is also accessing those objects.
.Pp
Additional memory is temporary allocated to deal with the parallel nature
of the computation.
.Pp
Because of the overhead of maintaining multiple threads, the
.Fn psort
family of routines may choose to just call
.Xr qsort 3
when there is no advantage to parallelizing (for example, when the number of
objects in the array is too small, or only one processor is available).
.Pp
Like
.Xr qsort 3 ,
the sort is not stable.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn psort ,
.Fn psort_b
and
.Fn psort_r
functions
return no value.

.Fn fork
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_atfork "void (*prepare)(void)" "void (*parent)(void)" "void (*child)(void)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_atfork
function is used to register functions to be called before and after
.Fn fork .
The
.Fa prepare 
handler is called before
.Fn fork ,
while the
.Fa parent
and
.Fa child
handlers are called after
.Fn fork
in the parent and child process respectively.
The
.Fa prepare
handlers are called in reverse order of their registration, while
.Fa parent
and
.Fa child
handlers are called in the order in which they were registered.
Any of the handlers may be NULL.
.Pp
.Em Important :
only async-signal-safe functions are allowed on the child side of
.Fn fork .
See
.Xr sigaction 2
for details.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_atfork
function will return zero; otherwise an error number will be returned to
indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_atfork
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The system lacked the necessary resources to add another handler to the list.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Thread attributes are used to specify parameters to
.Fn pthread_create .
One attribute object can be used in multiple calls to
.Fn pthread_create ,
with or without modifications between calls.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_init
function initializes
.Fa attr
with all the default thread attributes.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_destroy
function destroys
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_set*
functions set the attribute that corresponds to each function name.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_get*
functions copy the value of the attribute that corresponds to each function name
to the location pointed to by the second function parameter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Thread attributes are used to specify parameters to
.Fn pthread_create .
One attribute object can be used in multiple calls to
.Fn pthread_create ,
with or without modifications between calls.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_init
function initializes
.Fa attr
with all the default thread attributes.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_destroy
function destroys
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_set*
functions set the attribute that corresponds to each function name.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_get*
functions copy the value of the attribute that corresponds to each function name
to the location pointed to by the second function parameter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Thread attributes are used to specify parameters to
.Fn pthread_create .
One attribute object can be used in multiple calls to
.Fn pthread_create ,
with or without modifications between calls.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_init
function initializes
.Fa attr
with all the default thread attributes.
.Pp
The

functions set the attribute that corresponds to each function name.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_get*
functions copy the value of the attribute that corresponds to each function name
to the location pointed to by the second function parameter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Thread attributes are used to specify parameters to
.Fn pthread_create .
One attribute object can be used in multiple calls to
.Fn pthread_create ,
with or without modifications between calls.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_init
function initializes
.Fa attr
with all the default thread attributes.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_destroy
function destroys
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_set*
functions set the attribute that corresponds to each function name.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_get*
functions copy the value of the attribute that corresponds to each function name
to the location pointed to by the second function parameter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
