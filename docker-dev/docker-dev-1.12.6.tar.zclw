 shell opens this file and saves its name for possible
resubstitution by `$0'.  Because many systems use either the standard
version 6 or version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible
with this shell, the shell uses such a `standard' shell to execute a script
whose first character is not a `#', i.e., that does not start with a
comment.
.PP
Remaining arguments are placed in the \fBargv\fR shell variable.
.SS "Startup and shutdown"
A login shell begins by executing commands from the system files
\fI/etc/csh.cshrc\fR and \fI/etc/csh.login\fR.
It then executes commands from files in the user's \fBhome\fR directory:
first \fI~/.tcshrc\fR (+)
or, if \fI~/.tcshrc\fR is not found, \fI~/.cshrc\fR,
then \fI~/.history\fR (or the value of the \fBhistfile\fR shell variable),
then \fI~/.login\fR,
and finally \fI~/.cshdirs\fR (or the value of the \fBdirsfile\fR shell variable) (+).
The shell may read \fI/etc/csh.login\fR before instead of after
\fI/etc/csh.cshrc\fR, and \fI~/.login\fR before instead of after
\fI~/.tcshrc\fR or \fI~/.cshrc\fR and \fI~/.history\fR, if so compiled;
see the \fBversion\fR shell variable. (+)
.PP
Non-login shells read only \fI/etc/csh.cshrc\fR and \fI~/.tcshrc\fR
or \fI~/.cshrc\fR on startup.
.PP
For examples of startup files, please consult
\fIhttp://tcshrc.sourceforge.net\fR.
.PP
Commands like \fIstty\fR(1) and \fItset\fR(1),
which need be run only once per login, usually go in one's \fI~/.login\fR file.
Users who need to use the same set of files with both \fIcsh\fR(1) and
\fItcsh\fR can have only a \fI~/.cshrc\fR which checks for the existence of the
\fBtcsh\fR shell variable (q.v.) before using \fItcsh\fR-specific commands,
or can have both a \fI~/.cshrc\fR and a \fI~/.tcshrc\fR which \fIsource\fRs
(see the builtin command) \fI~/.cshrc\fR.
The rest of this manual uses `\fI~/.tcshrc\fR' to mean `\fI~/.tcshrc\fR or,
if \fI~/.tcshrc\fR is not found, \fI~/.cshrc\fR'.
.PP
In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands from the terminal,
prompting with `> '.  (Processing of arguments and the use of the shell to
process files containing command scripts are described later.)
The shell repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it into words,
places it on the command history list, parses it and executes each command
in the line.
.PP
One can log out by typing `^D' on an empty line, `logout' or `login' or
via the shell's autologout mechanism (see the \fBautologout\fR shell variable).
When a login shell terminates it sets the \fBlogout\fR shell variable to
`normal' or `automatic' as appropriate, then
executes commands from the files
\fI/etc/csh.logout\fR and \fI~/.logout\fR.  The shell may drop DTR on logout
if so compiled; see the \fBversion\fR shell variable.
.PP
The names of the system login and logout files vary from system to system for
compatibility with different \fIcsh\fR(1) variants; see \fBFILES\fR.
.SS Editing
We first describe \fBThe command-line editor\fR.
The \fBCompletion and listing\fR and \fBSpelling correction\fR sections
describe two sets of functionality that are implemented as editor commands
but which deserve their own treatment.
Finally, \fBEditor commands\fR lists and describes
the editor commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.
.SS "The command-line editor (+)"
Command-line input can be edited using key sequences much like those used in
GNU Emacs or \fIvi\fR(1).
The editor is active only when the \fBedit\fR shell variable is set, which
it is by default in interactive shells.
The \fIbindkey\fR builtin can display and change key bindings.
Emacs-style key bindings are used by default
(unless the shell was compiled otherwise; see the \fBversion\fR shell variable),
but \fIbindkey\fR can change the key bindings to \fIvi\fR-style bindings en masse.
.PP
The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the \fBTERMCAP\fR
environment variable) to
.PP
.PD 0
.RS +4
.TP 8
down
\fIdown-history\fR
.TP 8
up
\fIup-history\fR
.TP 8
left
\fIbackward-char\fR
.TP 8
right
\fIforward-char\fR
.PD
.RE
.PP
unless doing so would alter another single-character binding.
One can set the arrow key escape sequences to the empty string with \fIsettc\fR
to prevent these bindings.
The ANSI/VT100 sequences for arrow keys are always bound.
.PP
Other key bindings are, for the most part, what Emacs and \fIvi\fR(1)
users would expect and can easily be displayed by \fIbindkey\fR, so there
is no need to list them here.  Likewise, \fIbindkey\fR can list the editor
commands with a short description of each.
.PP
Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a ``word'' as does the
shell.  The editor delimits words with any non-alphanumeric characters not in
the shell variable \fBwordchars\fR, while the shell recognizes only whitespace
and some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed under
\fBLexical structure\fR.
.SS "Completion and listing (+)"
The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique abbreviation.
Type part of a word (for example `ls /usr/lost') and hit the tab key to
run the \fIcomplete-word\fR editor command.
The shell completes the filename `/usr/lost' to `/usr/lost+found/',
replacing the incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer.
(Note the terminal `/'; completion adds a `/' to the
end of completed directories and a space to the end of other completed words,
to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful completion.
The \fBaddsuffix\fR shell variable can be unset to prevent this.)
If no match is found (perhaps `/usr/lost+found' doesn't exist),
the terminal bell rings.
If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a `/usr/lost' on your
system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole thing)
a `/' or space is added to the end if it isn't already there.
.PP
Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed
text pushes the rest of the line to the right.  Completion in the middle of a word
often results in leftover characters to the right of the cursor that need
to be deleted.
.PP
Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way.
For example, typing `em[tab]' would complete `em' to
`emacs' if \fIemacs\fR were the only command on your system beginning with `em'.
Completion can find a command in any directory in \fBpath\fR or if
given a full pathname.
Typing `echo $ar[tab]' would complete `$ar' to `$argv'
if no other variable began with `ar'.
.PP
The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you want to
complete should be completed as a filename, command or variable.
The first word in the buffer and the first word following
`;', `|', `|&', `&&' or `||' is considered to be a command.
A word beginning with `$' is considered to be a variable.
Anything else is a filename.  An empty line is `completed' as a filename.
.PP
You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by typing `^D'
to run the \fIdelete-char-or-list-or-eof\fR editor command.
The shell lists the possible completions using the \fIls\-F\fR builtin (q.v.)
and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:
.IP "" 4
> ls /usr/l[^D]
.br
lbin/       lib/        local/      lost+found/
.br
> ls /usr/l
.PP
If the \fBautolist\fR shell variable is set, the shell lists the remaining
choices (if any) whenever completion fails:
.IP "" 4
> set autolist
.br
> nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]
.br
libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@
.br
> nm /usr/lib/libterm
.PP
If \fBautolist\fR is set to `ambiguous', choices are listed only when
completion fails and adds no new characters to the word being completed.
.PP
A filename to be completed can contain variables, your own or others' home
directories abbreviated with `~' (see \fBFilename substitution\fR) and
directory stack entries abbreviated with `='
(see \fBDirectory stack substitution\fR).  For example,
.IP "" 4
> ls ~k[^D]
.br
kahn    kas     kellogg
.br
> ls ~ke[tab]
.br
> ls ~kellogg/
.PP
or
.IP "" 4
> set local = /usr/local
.br
> ls $lo[tab]
.br
> ls $local/[^D]
.br
bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/
.br
> ls $local/
.PP
Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the
\fIexpand-variables\fR editor command.
.PP
\fIdelete-char-or-list-or-eof\fR lists at only the end of the line;
in the middle of a line it deletes the character under the cursor and
on an empty line it logs one out or, if \fBignoreeof\fR is set, does nothing.
`M-^D', bound to the editor command \fIlist-choices\fR, lists completion
possibilities anywhere on a line, and \fIlist-choices\fR (or any one of the
related editor commands that do or don't delete, list and/or log out,
listed under \fIdelete-char-or-list-or-eof\fR) can be bound to `^D' with
the \fIbindkey\fR builtin command if so desired.
.PP
The \fIcomplete-word-fwd\fR and \fIcomplete-word-back\fR editor commands
(not bound to any keys by default) can be used to cycle up and down through
the list of possible completions, replacing the current word with the next or
previous word in the list.
.PP
The shell variable \fBfignore\fR can be set to a list of suffixes to be
ignored by completion.  Consider the following:
.IP "" 4
> ls
.br
Makefile        condiments.h~   main.o          side.c
.br
README          main.c          meal            side.o
.br
condiments.h    main.c~
.br
> set fignore = (.o \\~)
.br
> emacs ma[^D]
.br
main.c   main.c~  main.o
.br
> emacs ma[tab]
.br
> emacs main.c
.PP
`main.c~' and `main.o' are ignored by completion (but not listing),
because they end in suffixes in \fBfignore\fR.
Note that a `\\' was needed in front of `~' to prevent it from being
expanded to \fBhome\fR as described under \fBFilename substitution\fR.
\fBfignore\fR is ignored if only one completion is possible.
.PP
If the \fBcomplete\fR shell variable is set to `enhance', completion
1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores
(`.', `\-' and `_') to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to
be equivalent.  If you had the following files
.IP "" 4
comp.lang.c      comp.lang.perl   comp.std.c++
.br
comp.lang.c++    comp.std.c
.PP
and typed `mail \-f c.l.c[tab]', it would be completed to
`mail \-f comp.lang.c', and ^D would list `comp.lang.c' and `comp.lang.c++'.
`mail \-f c..c++[^D]' would list `comp.lang.c++' and `comp.std.c++'.  Typing
`rm a\-\-file[^D]' in the following directory
.IP "" 4
A_silly_file    a-hyphenated-file    another_silly_file
.PP
would list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens and
underscores are equivalent.  Periods, however, are not equivalent to
hyphens or underscores.
.PP
If the \fBcomplete\fR shell variable is set to `Enhance', completion
ignores case and differences between a hyphen and an underscore word
separator only when the user types a lowercase character or a hyphen.
Entering an uppercase character or an underscore will not match the 
corresponding lowercase character or hyphen word separator.  
Typing `rm a\-\-file[^D]' in the directory of the previous example would 
still list all three files, but typing `rm A\-\-file' would match only 
`A_silly_file' and typing `rm a__file[^D]' would match just `A_silly_file' 
and `another_silly_file' because the user explicitly used an uppercase 
or an underscore character.  
.PP
Completion and listing are affected by several other shell variables:
\fBrecexact\fR can be set to complete on the shortest possible unique
match, even if more typing might result in a longer match:
.IP "" 4
> ls
.br
fodder   foo      food     foonly
.br
> set recexact
.br
> rm fo[tab]
.PP
just beeps, because `fo' could expand to `fod' or `foo', but if we type
another `o',
.IP "" 4
> rm foo[tab]
.br
> rm foo
.PP
the completion completes on `foo', even though `food' and `foonly'
also match.
\fBautoexpand\fR can be set to run the \fIexpand-history\fR editor command
before each completion attempt, \fBautocorrect\fR can be set to
spelling-correct the word to be completed (see \fBSpelling correction\fR)
before each completion attempt and \fBcorrect\fR can be set to complete
commands automatically after one hits `return'.
\fBmatchbeep\fR can be set to make completion beep or not beep in a variety
of situations, and \fBnobeep\fR can be set to never beep at all.
\fBnostat\fR can be set to a list of directories and/or patterns that
match directories to prevent the completion mechanism from \fIstat\fR(2)ing
those directories.
\fBlistmax\fR and \fBlistmaxrows\fR can be set to limit the number of items
and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first.
\fBrecognize_only_executables\fR can be set to make the shell list only
executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.
.PP
Finally, the \fIcomplete\fR builtin command can be used to tell the shell how
to complete words other than filenames, commands and variables.
Completion and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see \fBFilename substitution\fR),
but the \fIlist-glob\fR and \fIexpand-glob\fR editor commands perform
equivalent functions for glob-patterns.
.SS "Spelling correction (+)"
The shell can sometimes correct the spelling of filenames, commands and variable names
as well as completing and listing them.
.PP
Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the \fIspell-word\fR
editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S)
and the entire input buffer with \fIspell-line\fR (usually bound to M-$).
The \fBcorrect\fR shell variable can be set to `cmd' to correct the
command name or `all' to correct the entire line each time return is typed,
and \fBautocorrect\fR can be set to correct the word to be completed
before each completion attempt.
.PP
When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways and
the shell thinks that any part of the command line is misspelled,
it prompts with the corrected line:
.IP "" 4
> set correct = cmd
.br
> lz /usr/bin
.br
CORRECT>ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?
.PP
One can answer `y' or space to execute the corrected line,
`e' to leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer,
`a' to abort the command as if `^C' had been hit, and
anything else to execute the original line unchanged.
.PP
Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the
\fIcomplete\fR builtin command).  If an input word in a position for
which a completion is defined resembles a word in the completion list,
spelling correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter
word as a correction.  However, if the input word does not match any of
the possible completions for that position, spelling correction does
not register a misspelling.
.PP
Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line,
pushing the rest of the line to the right and possibly leaving
extra characters to the right of the cursor.
.PP
Beware: spelling correction is not guaranteed to work the way one intends,
and is provided mostly as an experimental feature.
Suggestions and improvements are welcome.
.SS "Editor commands (+)"
`bindkey' lists key bindings and `bindkey \-l' lists and briefly describes
editor commands.
Only new or especially interesting editor commands are described here.
See \fIemacs\fR(1) and \fIvi\fR(1) for descriptions of each editor's
key bindings.
.PP
The character or characters to which each command is bound by default is
given in parentheses.  `^\fIcharacter\fR' means a control character and
`M-\fIcharacter\fR' a meta character, typed as escape-\fIcharacter\fR
on terminals without a meta key.  Case counts, but commands that are bound
to letters by default are bound to both lower- and uppercase letters for
convenience.

Expands the current word to the most recent preceding one for which
the current is a leading substring, wrapping around the history list

Repeating \fIdabbrev-expand\fR without any intervening typing
changes to the next previous word etc., skipping identical matches
much like \fIhistory-search-backward\fR does.

See also those three commands, each of which does only a single action, and
\fIdelete-char-or-eof\fR, \fIdelete-char-or-list\fR and \fIlist-or-eof\fR,
each of which does a different two out of the three.

the current contents of the input buffer up to the cursor and copies it
into the input buffer.
The search string may be a glob-pattern (see \fBFilename substitution\fR)
containing `*', `?', `[]' or `{}'.
\fIup-history\fR and \fIdown-history\fR will proceed from the
appropriate point in the history list.
Emacs mode only.

.TP 8
.B history-search-forward \fR(M-n, M-N)
Like \fIhistory-search-backward\fR, but searches forward.
.TP 8
.B i-search-back \fR(not bound)
Searches backward like \fIhistory-search-backward\fR, copies the first match
into the input buffer with the cursor positioned at the end of the pattern,
and prompts with `bck: ' and the first match.  Additional characters may be
typed to extend the search, \fIi-search-back\fR may be typed to continue
searching with the same pattern, wrapping around the history list if
necessary, (\fIi-search-back\fR must be bound to a
single character for this to work) or one of the following special characters
may be typed:
.PP
.RS +8
.RS +4

.TP 8
^W
Appends the rest of the word under the cursor to the search pattern.

delete (or any character bound to \fIbackward-delete-char\fR)
Undoes the effect of the last character typed and deletes a character
from the search pattern if appropriate.
.TP 8
^G
If the previous search was successful, aborts the entire search.
If not, goes back to the last successful search.
.TP 8
escape
Ends the search, leaving the current line in the input buffer.
.RE
.PD
.PP
Any other character not bound to \fIself-insert-command\fR terminates the

.B list-or-eof \fR(not bound)
Does \fIlist-choices\fR
or \fIend-of-file\fR on an empty line.
See also \fIdelete-char-or-list-or-eof\fR.
.TP 8
.B magic-space \fR(not bound)
Expands history substitutions in the current line,
like \fIexpand-history\fR, and inserts a space.
\fImagic-space\fR is designed to be bound to the space bar,
but is not bound by default.
.TP 8
.B normalize-command \fR(^X-?)
Searches for the current word in PATH and, if it is found, replaces it with
the full path to the executable.  Special characters are quoted.  Aliases are
expanded and quoted but commands within aliases are not.  This command is
useful with commands that take commands as arguments, e.g., `dbx' and `sh \-x'.
.TP 8
.B normalize-path \fR(^X-n, ^X-N)
Expands the current word as described under the `expand' setting
of the \fBsymlinks\fR shell variable.
.TP 8
.B overwrite-mode \fR(unbound)
Toggles between input and overwrite modes.
.TP 8
.B run-fg-editor \fR(M-^Z)
Saves the current input line and
looks for a stopped job with a name equal to the last component of the
file name part of the \fBEDITOR\fR or \fBVISUAL\fR environment variables,
or, if neither is set, `ed' or `vi'.
If such a job is found, it is restarted as if `fg %\fIjob\fR' had been
typed.  This is used to toggle back and forth between an editor and
the shell easily.  Some people bind this command to `^Z' so they
can do this even more easily.
.TP
.B run-help \fR(M-h, M-H)
Searches for documentation on the current command, using the same notion of
`current command' as the completion routines, and prints it.  There is no way
to use a pager; \fIrun-help\fR is designed for short help files.
If the special alias \fBhelpcommand\fR is defined, it is run with the
command name as a sole argument.  Else,
documentation should be in a file named \fIcommand\fR.help, \fIcommand\fR.1,
\fIcommand\fR.6, \fIcommand\fR.8 or \fIcommand\fR, which should be in one
of the directories listed in the \fBHPATH\fR environment variable.
If there is more than one help file only the first is printed.
.TP 8
.B self-insert-command \fR(text characters)
In insert mode (the default), inserts the typed character into the input line after the character under the cursor.
In overwrite mode, replaces the character under the cursor with the typed character.
The input mode is normally preserved between lines, but the
\fBinputmode\fR shell variable can be set to `insert' or `overwrite' to put the
editor in that mode at the beginning of each line.
See also \fIoverwrite-mode\fR.
.TP 8
.B sequence-lead-in \fR(arrow prefix, meta prefix, ^X)
Indicates that the following characters are part of a
multi-key sequence.  Binding a command to a multi-key sequence really creates
two bindings: the first character to \fIsequence-lead-in\fR and the
whole sequence to the command.  All sequences beginning with a character
bound to \fIsequence-lead-in\fR are effectively bound to \fIundefined-key\fR
unless bound to another command.
.TP 8
.B spell-line \fR(M-$)
Attempts to correct the spelling of each word in the input buffer, like
\fIspell-word\fR, but ignores words whose first character is one of
`\-', `!', `^' or `%', or which contain `\\', `*' or `?', to avoid problems
with switches, substitutions and the like.
See \fBSpelling correction\fR.
.TP 8
.B spell-word \fR(M-s, M-S)
Attempts to correct the spelling of the current word as described
under \fBSpelling correction\fR.
Checks each component of a word which appears to be a pathname.
.TP 8
.B toggle-literal-history \fR(M-r, M-R)
Expands or `unexpands' history substitutions in the input buffer.
See also \fIexpand-history\fR and the \fBautoexpand\fR shell variable.
.TP 8
.B undefined-key \fR(any unbound key)
Beeps.
.TP 8
.B up-history \fR(up-arrow, ^P)
Copies the previous entry in the history list into the input buffer.
If \fBhistlit\fR is set, uses the literal form of the entry.
May be repeated to step up through the history list, stopping at the top.
.TP 8
.B vi-search-back \fR(?)
Prompts with `?' for a search string (which may be a glob-pattern, as with
\fIhistory-search-backward\fR), searches for it and copies it into the
input buffer.  The bell rings if no match is found.
Hitting return ends the search and leaves the last match in the input
buffer.
Hitting escape ends the search and executes the match.
\fIvi\fR mode only.
.TP 8
.B vi-search-fwd \fR(/)
Like \fIvi-search-back\fR, but searches forward.
.TP 8
.B which-command \fR(M-?)
Does a \fIwhich\fR (see the description of the builtin command) on the
first word of the input buffer.
.TP 8
.B yank-pop \fR(M-y)
When executed immediately after a \fIyank\fR or another \fIyank-pop\fR,
replaces the yanked string with the next previous string from the
killring. This also has the effect of rotating the killring, such that
this string will be considered the most recently killed by a later
\fIyank\fR command. Repeating \fIyank-pop\fR will cycle through the
killring any number of times.
.SS "Lexical structure"
The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs.  The special
characters `&', `|', `;', `<', `>', `(', and `)' and the doubled characters
`&&', `||', `<<' and `>>' are always separate words, whether or not they are
surrounded by whitespace.
.PP
When the shell's input is not a terminal, the character `#' is taken to begin a
comment.  Each `#' and the rest of the input line on which it appears is
discarded before further parsing.
.PP
A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented from having
its special meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by preceding it
with a backslash (`\\') or enclosing it in single (`''), double (`"') or
backward (``') quotes.  When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a `\\'
is equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence results in a
newline.
.PP
Furthermore, all \fBSubstitutions\fR (see below) except \fBHistory substitution\fR
can be prevented by enclosing the strings (or parts of strings)
in which they appear with single quotes or by quoting the crucial character(s)
(e.g., `$' or ``' for \fBVariable substitution\fR or \fBCommand substitution\fR respectively)
with `\\'.  (\fBAlias substitution\fR is no exception: quoting in any way any
character of a word for which an \fIalias\fR has been defined prevents
substitution of the alias.  The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it
with a backslash.) \fBHistory substitution\fR is prevented by
backslashes but not by single quotes.  Strings quoted with double or backward
quotes undergo \fBVariable substitution\fR and \fBCommand substitution\fR, but other
substitutions are prevented.
.PP
Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single word (or part of one).
Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do not form
separate words.  Only in one special case (see \fBCommand substitution\fR
below) can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word;
single-quoted strings never do.  Backward quotes are special: they signal
\fBCommand substitution\fR (q.v.), which may result in more than one word.
.PP
Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which themselves contain quoting
characters, can be confusing.  Remember that quotes need not be used as they are
in human writing!  It may be easier to quote not an entire string, but only
those parts of the string which need quoting, using different types of quoting
to do so if appropriate.
.PP
The \fBbackslash_quote\fR shell variable (q.v.) can be set to make backslashes
always quote `\\', `'', and `"'.  (+) This may make complex quoting tasks
easier, but it can cause syntax errors in \fIcsh\fR(1) scripts.
.SS Substitutions
We now describe the various transformations the shell performs on the input in
the order in which they occur.  We note in passing the data structures involved
and the commands and variables which affect them.  Remember that substitutions
can be prevented by quoting as described under \fBLexical structure\fR.
.SS "History substitution"
Each command, or ``event'', input from the terminal is saved in the history
list.  The previous command is always saved, and the \fBhistory\fR shell
variable can be set to a number to save that many commands.  The \fBhistdup\fR
shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or consecutive duplicate
events.
.PP
Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with the time.
It is not usually necessary to use event numbers, but the current event number
can be made part of the prompt by placing an `!' in the \fBprompt\fR shell variable.
.PP
The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal (unexpanded) forms.
If the \fBhistlit\fR shell variable is set, commands that display and store
history use the literal form.
.PP
The \fIhistory\fR builtin command can print, store in a file, restore
and clear the history list at any time,
and the \fBsavehist\fR and \fBhistfile\fR shell variables can be set to
store the history list automatically on logout and restore it on login.
.PP
History substitutions introduce words from the history list into the input
stream, making it easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a previous
command in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes in the previous
command with little typing and a high degree of confidence.
.PP
History substitutions begin with the character `!'.  They may begin anywhere in
the input stream, but they do not nest.  The `!' may be preceded by a `\\' to
prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a `!' is passed unchanged when it
is followed by a blank, tab, newline, `=' or `('.  History substitutions also
occur when an input line begins with `^'.  This special abbreviation will be
described later.  The characters used to signal history substitution (`!' and
`^') can be changed by setting the \fBhistchars\fR shell variable.  Any input
line which contains a history substitution is printed before it is executed.
.PP
A history substitution may have an ``event specification'', which indicates
the event from which words are to be taken, a ``word designator'',
which selects particular words from the chosen event, and/or a ``modifier'',
which manipulates the selected words.
.PP

For example, consider this bit of someone's history list:
.IP "" 4
\ 9  8:30    nroff \-man wumpus.man
.br
10  8:31    cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old
.br
11  8:36    vi wumpus.man
.br
12  8:37    diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man
.PP
The commands are shown with their event numbers and time stamps.
The current event, which we haven't typed in yet, is event 13.
`!11' and `!\-2' refer to event 11.
`!!' refers to the previous event, 12.  `!!' can be abbreviated `!' if it is
followed by `:' (`:' is described below).
`!n' refers to event 9, which begins with `n'.
`!?old?' also refers to event 12, which contains `old'.
Without word designators or modifiers history references simply expand to the
entire event, so we might type `!cp' to redo the copy command or `!!|more'
if the `diff' output scrolled off the top of the screen.
.PP
History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with braces if
necessary.  For example, `!vdoc' would look for a command beginning with
`vdoc', and, in this example, not find one, but `!{v}doc' would expand
unambiguously to `vi wumpus.mandoc'.
Even in braces, history substitutions do not nest.
.PP
(+) While \fIcsh\fR(1) expands, for example, `!3d' to event 3 with the
letter `d' appended to it, \fItcsh\fR expands it to the last event beginning
with `3d'; only completely numeric arguments are treated as event numbers.
This makes it possible to recall events beginning with numbers.
To expand `!3d' as in \fIcsh\fR(1) say `!{3}d'.
.PP
To select words from an event we can follow the event specification by a `:'
and a designator for the desired words.  The words of an input line are
numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0, the second word
(first argument) being 1, etc.  The basic word designators are:
.PP

Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single blanks.
For example, the `diff' command in the previous example might have been
typed as `diff !!:1.old !!:1' (using `:1' to select the first argument
from the previous event) or `diff !\-2:2 !\-2:1' to select and swap the
arguments from the `cp' command.  If we didn't care about the order of the
`diff' we might have said `diff !\-2:1\-2' or simply `diff !\-2:*'.
The `cp' command might have been written `cp wumpus.man !#:1.old', using `#'
to refer to the current event.
`!n:\- hurkle.man' would reuse the first two words from the `nroff' command
to say `nroff \-man hurkle.man'.
.PP
The `:' separating the event specification from the word designator can be
omitted if the argument selector begins with a `^', `$', `*', `%' or `\-'.
For example, our `diff' command might have been `diff !!^.old !!^' or,
equivalently, `diff !!$.old !!$'.  However, if `!!' is abbreviated `!',
an argument selector beginning with `\-' will be interpreted as an event
specification.
.PP
A history reference may have a word designator but no event specification.
It then references the previous command.
Continuing our `diff' example, we could have said simply `diff
!^.old !^' or, to get the arguments in the opposite order, just `diff !*'.

the eponymous \fIed\fR(1) command.
Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of `/';
a `\\' can be used to quote the delimiter inside \fIl\fR and \fIr\fR.
The character `&' in the \fIr\fR is replaced by \fIl\fR; `\\' also quotes `&'.
If \fIl\fR is empty (``''), the \fIl\fR from a previous substitution or the

Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless `g' is used).
It is an error for no word to be modifiable.
.PP
For example, the `diff' command might have been written as `diff wumpus.man.old
!#^:r', using `:r' to remove `.old' from the first argument on the same line
(`!#^').  We could say `echo hello out there', then `echo !*:u' to capitalize
`hello', `echo !*:au' to say it out loud, or `echo !*:agu' to really shout.
We might follow `mail \-s "I forgot my password" rot' with `!:s/rot/root' to
correct the spelling of `root' (but see \fBSpelling correction\fR for a
different approach).
.PP
There is a special abbreviation for substitutions.
`^', when it is the first character on an input line, is equivalent to `!:s^'.
Thus we might have said `^rot^root' to make the spelling correction in the
previous example.
This is the only history substitution which does not explicitly begin with `!'.
.PP
(+) In \fIcsh\fR as such, only one modifier may be applied to each history
or variable expansion.  In \fItcsh\fR, more than one may be used, for example
.IP "" 4
% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1
.br
% man !$:t:r
.br
man wumpus
.PP
In \fIcsh\fR, the result would be `wumpus.1:r'.  A substitution followed by a
colon may need to be insulated from it with braces:
.IP "" 4
> mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus
.br
> setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH
.br
Bad ! modifier: $.
.br
> setenv PATH !{\-2$:h}:$PATH
.br
setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.
.PP
The first attempt would succeed in \fIcsh\fR but fails in \fItcsh\fR,
because \fItcsh\fR expects another modifier after the second colon
rather than `$'.
.PP
Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as through
the substitutions just described.
The \fIup-\fR and \fIdown-history\fR, \fIhistory-search-backward\fR and
\fI-forward\fR, \fIi-search-back\fR and \fI-fwd\fR,
\fIvi-search-back\fR and \fI-fwd\fR, \fIcopy-prev-word\fR
and \fIinsert-last-word\fR editor commands search for
events in the history list and copy them into the input buffer.
The \fItoggle-literal-history\fR editor command switches between the
expanded and literal forms of history lines in the input buffer.
\fIexpand-history\fR and \fIexpand-line\fR expand history substitutions
in the current word and in the entire input buffer respectively.
.SS "Alias substitution"
The shell maintains a list of aliases which can be set, unset and printed by
the \fIalias\fR and \fIunalias\fR commands.  After a command line is parsed
into simple commands (see \fBCommands\fR) the first word of each command,
left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, the first word is
replaced by the alias.  If the alias contains a history reference, it undergoes
\fBHistory substitution\fR (q.v.) as though the original command were the
previous input line.  If the alias does not contain a history reference, the
argument list is left untouched.
.PP
Thus if the alias for `ls' were `ls \-l' the command `ls /usr' would become `ls
\-l /usr', the argument list here being undisturbed.  If the alias for `lookup'
were `grep !^ /etc/passwd' then `lookup bill' would become `grep bill
/etc/passwd'.  Aliases can be used to introduce parser metasyntax.  For
example, `alias print 'pr \e!* | lpr'' defines a ``command'' (`print') which
\fIpr\fR(1)s its arguments to the line printer.
.PP
Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of the command has no
alias.  If an alias substitution does not change the first word (as in the
previous example) it is flagged to prevent a loop.  Other loops are detected and
cause an error.
.PP
Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see \fBSpecial aliases\fR.
.SS "Variable substitution"
The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has as value a list of
zero or more words.
The values of shell variables can be displayed and changed with the
\fIset\fR and \fIunset\fR commands.
The system maintains its own list of ``environment'' variables.
These can be displayed and changed with \fIprintenv\fR, \fIsetenv\fR and
\fIunsetenv\fR.
.PP
(+) Variables may be made read-only with `set \-r' (q.v.).
Read-only variables may not be modified or unset;
attempting to do so will cause an error.
Once made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable,
so `set \-r' should be used with caution.
Environment variables cannot be made read-only.
.PP
Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it.
For instance, the \fBargv\fR variable is an image of the shell's argument
list, and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways.
Some of the variables referred to by the shell are toggles;
the shell does not care what their value is, only whether they are set or not.
For instance, the \fBverbose\fR variable is a toggle which causes command
input to be echoed.  The \fB\-v\fR command line option sets this variable.
\fBSpecial shell variables\fR lists all variables which are referred to by the shell.
.PP
Other operations treat variables numerically.  The `@' command permits numeric
calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a variable.  Variable
values are, however, always represented as (zero or more) strings.  For the
purposes of numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and
the second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.
.PP
After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is
executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by `$' characters.  This
expansion can be prevented by preceding the `$' with a `\e' except within `"'s
where it \fIalways\fR occurs, and within `''s where it \fInever\fR occurs.
Strings quoted by ``' are interpreted later (see \fBCommand substitution\fR
below) so `$' substitution does not occur there until later,
if at all.  A `$' is passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or
end-of-line.
.PP
Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are
variable expanded separately.  Otherwise, the command name and entire argument
list are expanded together.  It is thus possible for the first (command) word
(to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of which becomes the
command name, and the rest of which become arguments.
.PP
Unless enclosed in `"' or given the `:q' modifier the results of variable
substitution may eventually be command and filename substituted.  Within `"', a
variable whose value consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a)
single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by blanks.  When
the `:q' modifier is applied to a substitution the variable will expand to
multiple words with each word separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later
command or filename substitution.
.PP

${\fIname\fR}

letters and digits starting with a letter.  The underscore character is

If the first number of a range is omitted it defaults to `1'.

which the line is to be substituted, but \fIcsh\fR does not allow this.
.PD
.PP
The editor command \fIexpand-variables\fR, normally bound to `^X-$',
can be used to interactively expand individual variables.
.SS "Command, filename and directory stack substitution"
The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the arguments of builtin
commands.  This means that portions of expressions which are not evaluated are
not subjected to these expansions.  For commands which are not internal to the
shell, the command name is substituted separately from the argument list.  This
occurs very late, after input-output redirection is performed, and in a child
of the main shell.
.SS "Command substitution"
Command substitution is indicated by a command enclosed in ``'.  The output
from such a command is broken into separate words at blanks, tabs and newlines,
and null words are discarded.  The output is variable and command substituted
and put in place of the original string.
.PP
Command substitutions inside double
quotes (`"') retain blanks and tabs; only newlines force new words.  The single
final newline does not force a new word in any case.  It is thus possible for a
command substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs
a complete line.
.PP
By default, the shell since version 6.12 replaces all newline and carriage 
return characters in the command by spaces.  If this is switched off by
unsetting \fBcsubstnonl\fR, newlines separate commands as usual.
.SS "Filename substitution"
If a word contains any of the characters `*', `?', `[' or `{' or begins with
the character `~' it is a candidate for filename substitution, also known as
``globbing''.  This word is then regarded as a pattern (``glob-pattern''), and
replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names which match the
pattern.
.PP
In matching filenames, the character `.' at the beginning of a filename or
immediately following a `/', as well as the character `/' must be matched
explicitly (unless either
.B globdot
or
.B globstar
or both are set(+)).  The character `*' matches any string of characters, 
including the null string.  The character `?' matches any single character.  
The sequence `[...]' matches any one of the characters enclosed.  
Within `[...]', a pair of
characters separated by `\-' matches any character lexically between the two.
.PP
(+) Some glob-patterns can be negated:
The sequence `[^...]' matches any single character \fInot\fR specified by the
characters and/or ranges of characters in the braces.
.PP
An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with `^':
.IP "" 4
> echo *
.br
bang crash crunch ouch
.br
> echo ^cr*
.br
bang ouch
.PP
Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*', or `[]' or which use `{}' or `~'
(below) are not negated correctly.
.PP
The metanotation `a{b,c,d}e' is a shorthand for `abe ace ade'.
Left-to-right order is preserved: `/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c' expands
to `/usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c'.  The results of matches are
sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order:
`../{memo,*box}' might expand to `../memo ../box ../mbox'.
(Note that `memo' was not sorted with the results of matching `*box'.)
It is not an error when this construct expands to files which do not exist,
but it is possible to get an error from a command to which the expanded list
is passed.
This construct may be nested.
As a special case the words `{', `}' and `{}' are passed undisturbed.
.PP
The character `~' at the beginning of a filename refers to home directories.
Standing alone, i.e., `~', it expands to the invoker's home directory as
reflected in the value of the \fBhome\fR shell variable.  When followed by a
name consisting of letters, digits and `\-' characters the shell searches for a
user with that name and substitutes their home directory; thus `~ken' might
expand to `/usr/ken' and `~ken/chmach' to `/usr/ken/chmach'.  If the character
`~' is followed by a character other than a letter or `/' or appears elsewhere
than at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.
A command like `setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man' does not,
therefore, do home directory substitution as one might hope.
.PP
It is an error for a glob-pattern containing `*', `?', `[' or `~', with or
without `^', not to match any files.  However, only one pattern in a list of
glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g., `rm *.a *.c *.o' would fail
only if there were no files in the current directory ending in `.a', `.c', or
`.o'), and if the \fBnonomatch\fR shell variable is set a pattern (or list
of patterns) which matches nothing is left unchanged rather than causing
an error.
.PP
The \fBglobstar\fR shell variable can be set to allow `**' or `***' as 
a file glob pattern that matches any string of characters including `/',
recursively traversing any existing sub-directories.  For example, 
`ls **.c' will list all the .c files in the current directory tree.
If used by itself, it will match match zero or more sub-directories
(e.g. `ls /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h'
in the /usr/include directory tree; `ls /usr/include/**time.h' will match 
any file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h'; and
`ls /usr/include/**time**.h' will match any .h file with `time' either
in a subdirectory name or in the filename itself).
To prevent problems with recursion, the `**' glob-pattern will not 
descend into a symbolic link containing a directory.  To override this,
use `***' (+)
.PP
The \fBnoglob\fR shell variable can be set to prevent filename substitution,
and the \fIexpand-glob\fR editor command, normally bound to `^X-*', can be
used to interactively expand individual filename substitutions.
.SS "Directory stack substitution (+)"
The directory stack is a list of directories, numbered from zero, used by the
\fIpushd\fR, \fIpopd\fR and \fIdirs\fR builtin commands (q.v.).
\fIdirs\fR can print, store in a file, restore and clear the directory stack
at any time, and the \fBsavedirs\fR and \fBdirsfile\fR shell variables can be set to
store the directory stack automatically on logout and restore it on login.
The \fBdirstack\fR shell variable can be examined to see the directory stack and
set to put arbitrary directories into the directory stack.
.PP
The character `=' followed by one or more digits expands to an entry in
the directory stack.  The special case `=\-' expands to the last directory in
the stack.  For example,
.IP "" 4
> dirs \-v
.br
0       /usr/bin
.br
1       /usr/spool/uucp
.br
2       /usr/accts/sys
.br
> echo =1
.br
/usr/spool/uucp
.br
> echo =0/calendar
.br
/usr/bin/calendar
.br
> echo =\-
.br
/usr/accts/sys
.PP
The \fBnoglob\fR and \fBnonomatch\fR shell variables and the \fIexpand-glob\fR
editor command apply to directory stack as well as filename substitutions.
.SS "Other substitutions (+)"
There are several more transformations involving filenames, not strictly
related to the above but mentioned here for completeness.
\fIAny\fR filename may be expanded to a full path when the
\fBsymlinks\fR variable (q.v.) is set to `expand'.
Quoting prevents this expansion, and
the \fInormalize-path\fR editor command does it on demand.
The \fInormalize-command\fR editor command expands commands in PATH into
full paths on demand.
Finally, \fIcd\fR and \fIpushd\fR interpret `\-' as the old working directory
(equivalent to the shell variable \fBowd\fR).
This is not a substitution at all, but an abbreviation recognized by only
those commands.  Nonetheless, it too can be prevented by quoting.
.SS Commands
The next three sections describe how the shell executes commands and
deals with their input and output.
.SS Simple commands, pipelines and sequences
A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies the
command to be executed.  A series of simple commands joined by `|' characters
forms a pipeline.  The output of each command in a pipeline is connected to the
input of the next.
.PP
Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with `;', and will
be executed sequentially.  Commands and pipelines can also be joined into
sequences with `||' or `&&', indicating, as in the C language, that the second
is to be executed only if the first fails or succeeds respectively.
.PP
A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in parentheses, `()',
to form a simple command, which may in turn be a component of a pipeline or
sequence.  A command, pipeline or sequence can be executed
without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an `&'.
.SS "Builtin and non-builtin command execution"
Builtin commands are executed within the shell.  If any component of a
pipeline except the last is a builtin command, the pipeline is executed
in a subshell.
.PP
Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell.
.IP "" 4
(cd; pwd); pwd
.PP
thus prints the \fBhome\fR directory, leaving you where you were
(printing this after the home directory), while
.IP "" 4
cd; pwd
.PP
leaves you in the \fBhome\fR directory.  Parenthesized commands are most often
used to prevent \fIcd\fR from affecting the current shell.
.PP
When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command the shell
attempts to execute the command via \fIexecve\fR(2).  Each word in the variable
\fBpath\fR names a directory in which the shell will look for the
command.  If the shell is not given a \fB\-f\fR option, the shell
hashes the names in these directories into an internal table so that it will
try an \fIexecve\fR(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the
command resides there.  This greatly speeds command location when a large
number of directories are present in the search path. This hashing mechanism is
not used:
.TP 4
.B 1.
If hashing is turned explicitly off via \fIunhash\fR.
.TP 4
.B 2.
If the shell was given a \fB\-f\fR argument.
.TP 4
.B 3.
For each directory component of \fBpath\fR which does not begin with a `/'.
.TP 4
.B 4.
If the command contains a `/'.
.PP
In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the path
vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file which it
then attempts to execute it. If execution is successful, the search stops.
.PP
If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to the system
(i.e., it is neither an executable binary nor a script that specifies its
interpreter), then it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands and
a new shell is spawned to read it.  The \fIshell\fR special alias may be set
to specify an interpreter other than the shell itself.
.PP
On systems which do not understand the `#!' script interpreter convention
the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the \fBversion\fR shell
variable.  If so, the shell checks the first line of the file to
see if it is of the form `#!\fIinterpreter\fR \fIarg\fR ...'.  If it is,
the shell starts \fIinterpreter\fR with the given \fIarg\fRs and feeds the
file to it on standard input.
.SS Input/output
The standard input and standard output of a command may be redirected with the
following syntax:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 8
< \fIname
Open file \fIname\fR (which is first variable, command and filename
expanded) as the standard input.
.TP 8
<< \fIword
Read the shell input up to a line which is identical to \fIword\fR.  \fIword\fR
is not subjected to variable, filename or command substitution, and each input
line is compared to \fIword\fR before any substitutions are done on this input
line.  Unless a quoting `\e', `"', `' or ``' appears in \fIword\fR variable and
command substitution is performed on the intervening lines, allowing `\e' to
quote `$', `\e' and ``'.  Commands which are substituted have all blanks, tabs,
and newlines preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped.  The
resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary file which is given to the
command as standard input.
.PP
> \fIname
.br
>! \fIname
.br
>& \fIname
.TP 8
>&! \fIname
The file \fIname\fR is used as standard output.  If the file does not exist
then it is created; if the file exists, it is truncated, its previous contents
being lost.
.RS +8
.PD
.PP
If the shell variable \fBnoclobber\fR is set, then the file must not exist or be a
character special file (e.g., a terminal or `/dev/null') or an error results.
This helps prevent accidental destruction of files.  In this case the `!' forms
can be used to suppress this check.
.PP
The forms involving `&' route the diagnostic output into the specified file as
well as the standard output.  \fIname\fR is expanded in the same way as `<'
input filenames are.
.PD 0
.RE
.PP
>> \fIname
.br
>>& \fIname
.br
>>! \fIname
.TP 8
>>&! \fIname
Like `>', but appends output to the end of \fIname\fR.
If the shell variable \fBnoclobber\fR is set, then it is an error for
the file \fInot\fR to exist, unless one of the `!' forms is given.
.PD
.PP
A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked as modified
by the input-output parameters and the presence of the command in a pipeline.
Thus, unlike some previous shells, commands run from a file of shell commands
have no access to the text of the commands by default; rather they receive the
original standard input of the shell.  The `<<' mechanism should be used to
present inline data.  This permits shell command scripts to function as
components of pipelines and allows the shell to block read its input.  Note
that the default standard input for a command run detached is \fInot\fR
the empty file \fI/dev/null\fR, but the original standard input of the shell.
If this is a terminal and if the process attempts to read from the terminal,
then the process will block and the user will be notified (see \fBJobs\fR).
.PP
Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with the standard output.
Simply use the form `|&' rather than just `|'.
.PP
The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output without also redirecting
standard output, but `(\fIcommand\fR > \fIoutput-file\fR) >& \fIerror-file\fR'
is often an acceptable workaround.  Either \fIoutput-file\fR or
\fIerror-file\fR may be `/dev/tty' to send output to the terminal.
.SS Features
Having described how the shell accepts, parses and executes
command lines, we now turn to a variety of its useful features.
.SS "Control flow"
The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to regulate the
flow of control in command files (shell scripts) and (in limited but
useful ways) from terminal input.  These commands all operate by forcing the
shell to reread or skip in its input and, due to the implementation,
restrict the placement of some of the commands.
.PP
The \fIforeach\fR, \fIswitch\fR, and \fIwhile\fR statements, as well as the
\fIif-then-else\fR form of the \fIif\fR statement, require that the major
keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line as shown below.
.PP
If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input whenever
a loop is being read and performs seeks in this internal buffer to
accomplish the rereading implied by the loop.  (To the extent that this
allows, backward \fIgoto\fRs will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)
.SS Expressions
The \fIif\fR, \fIwhile\fR and \fIexit\fR builtin commands
use expressions with a common syntax.  The expressions can include any
of the operators described in the next three sections.  Note that the \fI@\fR
builtin command (q.v.) has its own separate syntax.
.SS "Logical, arithmetical and comparison operators"
These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence.
They include
.IP "" 4
||  &&  |  ^  &  ==  !=  =~  !~  <=  >=
.br
<  > <<  >>  +  \-  *  /  %  !  ~  (  )
.PP
Here the precedence increases to the right, `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~', `<='
`>=' `<' and `>', `<<' and `>>', `+' and `\-', `*' `/' and `%' being, in
groups, at the same level.  The `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~' operators compare
their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers.  The operators
`=~' and `!~' are like `!=' and `==' except that the right hand side is a
glob-pattern (see \fBFilename substitution\fR) against which the left hand
operand is matched.  This reduces the need for use of the \fIswitch\fR
builtin command in shell scripts when all that is really needed is
pattern matching.
.PP
Null or
missing arguments are considered `0'.  The results of all expressions are
strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It is important to note that
no two components of an expression can appear in the same word; except
when adjacent to components of expressions which are syntactically
significant to the parser (`&' `|' `<' `>' `(' `)') they should be
surrounded by spaces.
.SS "Command exit status"
Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status
returned by enclosing them in braces (`{}').  Remember that the braces should
be separated from the words of the command by spaces.  Command executions
succeed, returning true, i.e., `1', if the command exits with status 0,
otherwise they fail, returning false, i.e., `0'.  If more detailed status
information is required then the command should be executed outside of an
expression and the \fBstatus\fR shell variable examined.
.SS "File inquiry operators"
Some of these operators perform true/false tests on files and related
objects.  They are of the form \fB\-\fIop file\fR, where \fIop\fR is one of

.RE
.PD
.PP
\fIfile\fR is command and filename expanded and then tested to
see if it has the specified relationship to the real user.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist or is inaccessible or, for the operators indicated by `*',
if the specified file type does not exist on the current system,
then all enquiries return false, i.e., `0'.
.PP
These operators may be combined for conciseness: `\-\fIxy file\fR' is
equivalent to `\-\fIx file\fR && \-\fIy file\fR'.  (+) For example, `\-fx' is true
(returns `1') for plain executable files, but not for directories.
.PP
\fBL\fR may be used in a multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators
to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link points.
For example, `\-lLo' is true for links owned by the invoking user.
\fBLr\fR, \fBLw\fR and \fBLx\fR are always true for links and false for
non-links.  \fBL\fR has a different meaning when it is the last operator
in a multiple-operator test; see below.
.PP
It is possible but not useful, and sometimes misleading, to combine operators
which expect \fIfile\fR to be a file with operators which do not
(e.g., \fBX\fR and \fBt\fR).  Following \fBL\fR with a non-file operator
can lead to particularly strange results.
.PP
Other operators return other information, i.e., not just `0' or `1'.  (+)

Only one of these operators may appear in a multiple-operator test, and it
must be the last.  Note that \fBL\fR has a different meaning at the end of and
elsewhere in a multiple-operator test.  Because `0' is a valid return value
for many of these operators, they do not return `0' when they fail: most
return `\-1', and \fBF\fR returns `:'.
.PP
If the shell is compiled with POSIX defined (see the \fBversion\fR shell
variable), the result of a file inquiry is based on the permission bits of
the file and not on the result of the \fIaccess\fR(2) system call.
For example, if one tests a file with \fB\-w\fR whose permissions would
ordinarily allow writing but which is on a file system mounted read-only,
the test will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.
.PP
File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the \fIfiletest\fR builtin
command (q.v.) (+).
.SS Jobs
The shell associates a \fIjob\fR with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of
current jobs, printed by the \fIjobs\fR command, and assigns them small integer
numbers.  When a job is started asynchronously with `&', the shell prints a
line which looks like
.IP "" 4
[1] 1234
.PP
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and
had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.
.PP
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the suspend
key (usually `^Z'),
which sends a STOP signal to the current job.  The shell will then normally
indicate that the job has been `Suspended' and print another prompt.
If the \fBlistjobs\fR shell variable is set, all jobs will be listed
like the \fIjobs\fR builtin command; if it is set to `long' the listing will
be in long format, like `jobs \-l'.
You can then manipulate the state of the suspended job.
You can put it in the
``background'' with the \fIbg\fR command or run some other commands and
eventually bring the job back into the ``foreground'' with \fIfg\fR.
(See also the \fIrun-fg-editor\fR editor command.)
A `^Z' takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt
in that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.
The \fIwait\fR builtin command causes the shell to wait for all background
jobs to complete.
.PP
The `^]' key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a STOP
signal until a program attempts to \fIread\fR(2) it, to the current job.
This can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some commands for a
job which you wish to stop after it has read them.
The `^Y' key performs this function in \fIcsh\fR(1); in \fItcsh\fR,
`^Y' is an editing command.  (+)
.PP
A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the
terminal.  Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can
be disabled by giving the command `stty tostop'.  If you set this tty option,
then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like they do
when they try to read input.
.PP
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  The character `%'
introduces a job name.  If you wish to refer to job number 1, you can name it
as `%1'.  Just naming a job brings it to the foreground; thus `%1' is a synonym
for `fg %1', bringing job 1 back into the foreground.  Similarly, saying `%1 &'
resumes job 1 in the background, just like `bg %1'.  A job can also be named
by an unambiguous prefix of the string typed in to start it: `%ex' would
normally restart a suspended \fIex\fR(1) job, if there were only one suspended
job whose name began with the string `ex'.  It is also possible to say
`%?\fIstring\fR' to specify a job whose text contains \fIstring\fR, if there
is only one such job.
.PP
The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs.  In output
pertaining to jobs, the current job is marked with a `+' and the previous job
with a `\-'.  The abbreviations `%+', `%', and (by analogy with the syntax of
the \fIhistory\fR mechanism) `%%' all refer to the current job, and `%\-' refers
to the previous job.
.PP
The job control mechanism requires that the \fIstty\fR(1) option `new' be set
on some systems.  It is an artifact from a `new' implementation of the tty
driver which allows generation of interrupt characters from the keyboard to
tell jobs to stop.  See \fIstty\fR(1) and the \fIsetty\fR builtin command for
details on setting options in the new tty driver.
.SS "Status reporting"
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally
informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is
possible, but only right before it prints a prompt.  This is done so that it
does not otherwise disturb your work.  If, however, you set the shell variable
\fBnotify\fR, the shell will notify you immediately of changes of status in
background jobs.  There is also a shell command \fInotify\fR which marks a
single process so that its status changes will be immediately reported.  By
default \fInotify\fR marks the current process; simply say `notify' after
starting a background job to mark it.
.PP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be
warned that `There are suspended jobs.' You may use the \fIjobs\fR command to
see what they are.  If you do this or immediately try to exit again, the shell
will not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.
.SS "Automatic, periodic and timed events (+)"
There are various ways to run commands and take other actions automatically
at various times in the ``life cycle'' of the shell.  They are summarized here,
and described in detail under the appropriate \fBBuiltin commands\fR,
\fBSpecial shell variables\fR and \fBSpecial aliases\fR.
.PP
The \fIsched\fR builtin command puts commands in a scheduled-event list,
to be executed by the shell at a given time.
.PP
The \fIbeepcmd\fR, \fIcwdcmd\fR, \fIperiodic\fR, \fIprecmd\fR, \fIpostcmd\fR,
and \fIjobcmd\fR
\fBSpecial aliases\fR can be set, respectively, to execute commands when the shell wants
to ring the bell, when the working directory changes, every \fBtperiod\fR
minutes, before each prompt, before each command gets executed, after each
command gets executed, and when a job is started or is brought into the
foreground.
.PP
The \fBautologout\fR shell variable can be set to log out or lock the shell
after a given number of minutes of inactivity.
.PP
The \fBmail\fR shell variable can be set to check for new mail periodically.
.PP
The \fBprintexitvalue\fR shell variable can be set to print the exit status
of commands which exit with a status other than zero.
.PP
The \fBrmstar\fR shell variable can be set to ask the user, when `rm *' is
typed, if that is really what was meant.
.PP
The \fBtime\fR shell variable can be set to execute the \fItime\fR builtin
command after the completion of any process that takes more than a given
number of CPU seconds.
.PP
The \fBwatch\fR and \fBwho\fR shell variables can be set to report when
selected users log in or out, and the \fIlog\fR builtin command reports
on those users at any time.
.SS "Native Language System support (+)"
The shell is eight bit clean
(if so compiled; see the \fBversion\fR shell variable)
and thus supports character sets needing this capability.
NLS support differs depending on whether or not
the shell was compiled to use the system's NLS (again, see \fBversion\fR).
In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default character code
(e.g., the classification of which characters are printable) and sorting,
and changing the \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_CTYPE\fR environment variables
causes a check for possible changes in these respects.
.PP
When using the system's NLS, the \fIsetlocale\fR(3) function is called
to determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting
(e.g., a 'en_CA.UTF-8' would yield "UTF-8" as a character code).
This function typically examines the \fBLANG\fR and \fBLC_CTYPE\fR
environment variables; refer to the system documentation for further details.
When not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the
ISO 8859-1 character set is used
whenever either of the \fBLANG\fR and \fBLC_CTYPE\fR variables are set, regardless of
their values.  Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.
.PP
In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable
characters in the range \e200\-\e377, i.e., those that have
M-\fIchar\fR bindings, are automatically rebound to \fIself-insert-command\fR.
The corresponding binding for the escape-\fIchar\fR sequence, if any, is
left alone.
These characters are not rebound if the \fBNOREBIND\fR environment variable
is set.  This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS
which assumes full ISO 8859-1.  Otherwise, all M-\fIchar\fR bindings in the
range \e240\-\e377 are effectively undone.
Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with \fIbindkey\fR
is of course still possible.
.PP
Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor control
characters) are printed in the format \ennn.
If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by
converting them to ASCII and using standout mode.  The shell
never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and tracks user-initiated
changes of 7/8 bit mode.  NLS users (or, for that matter, those who want to
use a meta key) may need to explicitly set
the tty in 8 bit mode through the appropriate \fIstty\fR(1)
command in, e.g., the \fI~/.login\fR file.
.SS "OS variant support (+)"
A number of new builtin commands are provided to support features in
particular operating systems.  All are described in detail in the
\fBBuiltin commands\fR section.
.PP

Under Harris CX/UX, \fIucb\fR or \fIatt\fR runs a command under the specified
universe.
.PP
Under Convex/OS, \fIwarp\fR prints or sets the universe.
.PP
The \fBVENDOR\fR, \fBOSTYPE\fR and \fBMACHTYPE\fR environment variables
indicate respectively the vendor, operating system and machine type
(microprocessor class or machine model) of the
system on which the shell thinks it is running.
These are particularly useful when sharing one's home directory between several
types of machines; one can, for example,
.IP "" 4
set path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)
.PP
in one's \fI~/.login\fR and put executables compiled for each machine in the
appropriate directory.
.PP
The \fBversion\fR shell
variable indicates what options were chosen when the shell was compiled.
.PP
Note also the \fInewgrp\fR builtin, the \fBafsuser\fR and
\fBecho_style\fR shell variables and the system-dependent locations of
the shell's input files (see \fBFILES\fR).
.SS "Signal handling"
Login shells ignore interrupts when reading the file \fI~/.logout\fR.
The shell ignores quit signals unless started with \fB\-q\fR.
Login shells catch the terminate signal, but non-login shells inherit the
terminate behavior from their parents.
Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from its parent.
.PP
In shell scripts, the shell's handling of interrupt and terminate signals
can be controlled with \fIonintr\fR, and its handling of hangups can be
controlled with \fIhup\fR and \fInohup\fR.
.PP
The shell exits on a hangup (see also the \fBlogout\fR shell variable).  By
default, the shell's children do too, but the shell does not send them a
hangup when it exits.  \fIhup\fR arranges for the shell to send a hangup to
a child when it exits, and \fInohup\fR sets a child to ignore hangups.
.SS "Terminal management (+)"
The shell uses three different sets of terminal (``tty'') modes:
`edit', used when editing, `quote', used when quoting literal characters,
and `execute', used when executing commands.
The shell holds some settings in each mode constant, so commands which leave
the tty in a confused state do not interfere with the shell.
The shell also matches changes in the speed and padding of the tty.
The list of tty modes that are kept constant
can be examined and modified with the \fIsetty\fR builtin.
Note that although the editor uses CBREAK mode (or its equivalent),
it takes typed-ahead characters anyway.
.PP
The \fIechotc\fR, \fIsettc\fR and \fItelltc\fR commands can be used to
manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the command line.
.PP
On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell
adapts to window resizing automatically and adjusts the environment
variables \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR if set.  If the environment
variable \fBTERMCAP\fR contains li# and co# fields, the shell adjusts
them to reflect the new window size.

\fIselect\fR is an optional glob-pattern.
If given, words from only \fIlist\fR that match \fIselect\fR are considered
and the \fBfignore\fR shell variable is ignored.
The last three types of completion may not have a \fIselect\fR
pattern, and \fBx\fR uses \fIselect\fR as an explanatory message when
the \fIlist-choices\fR editor command is used.
.PP
\fIsuffix\fR is a single character to be appended to a successful
completion.  If null, no character is appended.  If omitted (in which
case the fourth delimiter can also be omitted), a slash is appended to
directories and a space to other words.
.PP
\fIcommand\fR invoked from `...` version has additional environment
variable set, the variable name is \%\fBCOMMAND_LINE\fR\% and
contains (as its name indicates) contents of the current (already
typed in) command line. One can examine and use contents of the
\%\fBCOMMAND_LINE\fR\% variable in her custom script to build more
sophisticated completions (see completion for svn(1) included in
this package).
.PP
Now for some examples.  Some commands take only directories as arguments,
so there's no point completing plain files.
.IP "" 4
> complete cd 'p/1/d/'
.PP
completes only the first word following `cd' (`p/1') with a directory.
\fBp\fR-type completion can also be used to narrow down command completion:
.IP "" 4
> co[^D]
.br
complete compress
.br
> complete \-co* 'p/0/(compress)/'
.br
> co[^D]
.br
> compress
.PP
This completion completes commands (words in position 0, `p/0')
which begin with `co' (thus matching `co*') to `compress' (the only
word in the list).
The leading `\-' indicates that this completion is to be used with only
ambiguous commands.
.IP "" 4
> complete find 'n/\-user/u/'
.PP
is an example of \fBn\fR-type completion.  Any word following `find' and
immediately following `\-user' is completed from the list of users.
.IP "" 4
> complete cc 'c/\-I/d/'
.PP
demonstrates \fBc\fR-type completion.  Any word following `cc' and beginning
with `\-I' is completed as a directory.  `\-I' is not taken as part of the
directory because we used lowercase \fBc\fR.
.PP
Different \fIlist\fRs are useful with different commands.
.IP "" 4
> complete alias 'p/1/a/'
.br
> complete man 'p/*/c/'
.br
> complete set 'p/1/s/'
.br
> complete true 'p/1/x:Truth has no options./'
.PP
These complete words following `alias' with aliases, `man' with commands,
and `set' with shell variables.
`true' doesn't have any options, so \fBx\fR does nothing when completion
is attempted and prints `Truth has no options.' when completion choices are listed.
.PP
Note that the \fIman\fR example, and several other examples below, could
just as well have used 'c/*' or 'n/*' as 'p/*'.
.PP
Words can be completed from a variable evaluated at completion time,
.IP "" 4
> complete ftp 'p/1/$hostnames/'
.br
> set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu)
.br

or from a command run at completion time:
.IP "" 4

.br

.br
23113 23377 23380 23406 23429 23529 23530 PID
.PP
Note that the \fIcomplete\fR command does not itself quote its arguments,
so the braces, space and `$' in `{print $1}' must be quoted explicitly.
.PP
One command can have multiple completions:
.IP "" 4
> complete dbx 'p/2/(core)/' 'p/*/c/'
.PP
completes the second argument to `dbx' with the word `core' and all other
arguments with commands.  Note that the positional completion is specified
before the next-word completion.
Because completions are evaluated from left to right, if
the next-word completion were specified first it would always match
and the positional completion would never be executed.  This is a
common mistake when defining a completion.
.PP
The \fIselect\fR pattern is useful when a command takes files with only
particular forms as arguments.  For example,
.IP "" 4
> complete cc 'p/*/f:*.[cao]/'
.PP
completes `cc' arguments to files ending in only `.c', `.a', or `.o'.
\fIselect\fR can also exclude files, using negation of a glob-pattern as
described under \fBFilename substitution\fR.  One might use
.IP "" 4
> complete rm 'p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/'
.PP
to exclude precious source code from `rm' completion.  Of course, one
could still type excluded names manually or override the completion
mechanism using the \fIcomplete-word-raw\fR or \fIlist-choices-raw\fR
editor commands (q.v.).
.PP
The `C', `D', `F' and `T' \fIlist\fRs are like `c', `d', `f' and `t'
respectively, but they use the \fIselect\fR argument in a different way: to
restrict completion to files beginning with a particular path prefix.  For
example, the Elm mail program uses `=' as an abbreviation for one's mail
directory.  One might use
.IP "" 4
> complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@
.PP
to complete `elm \-f =' as if it were `elm \-f ~/Mail/'.  Note that we used `@'
instead of `/' to avoid confusion with the \fIselect\fR argument, and we used
`$HOME' instead of `~' because home directory substitution works at only the
beginning of a word.
.PP
\fIsuffix\fR is used to add a nonstandard suffix
(not space or `/' for directories) to completed words.
.IP "" 4
> complete finger 'c/*@/$hostnames/' 'p/1/u/@'
.PP
completes arguments to `finger' from the list of users, appends an `@',
and then completes after the `@' from the `hostnames' variable.  Note
again the order in which the completions are specified.
.PP
Finally, here's a complex example for inspiration:
.IP "" 4
> complete find \\
.br
\&'n/\-name/f/' 'n/\-newer/f/' 'n/\-{,n}cpio/f/' \e
.br
\&\'n/\-exec/c/' 'n/\-ok/c/' 'n/\-user/u/' \e

.br
group fstype type atime ctime depth inum \e
.br
ls mtime nogroup nouser perm print prune \e
.br
size xdev)/' \e
.br
\&'p/*/d/'
.PP
This completes words following `\-name', `\-newer', `\-cpio' or `ncpio'
(note the pattern which matches both) to files,
words following `\-exec' or `\-ok' to commands, words following `user'
and `group' to users and groups respectively
and words following `\-fstype' or `\-type' to members of the
given lists.  It also completes the switches themselves from the given list
(note the use of \fBc\fR-type completion)
and completes anything not otherwise completed to a directory.  Whew.
.PP
Remember that programmed completions are ignored if the word being completed
is a tilde substitution (beginning with `~') or a variable (beginning with `$').
\fIcomplete\fR is an experimental feature, and the syntax may change
in future versions of the shell.

With \fB\-S\fR, the second form saves the history list to \fIfilename\fR.
If the first word of the \fBsavehist\fR shell variable is set to a

\fBsavehist\fR is set to `merge', the history list is merged with the
existing history file instead of replacing it (if there is one) and
sorted by time stamp.  (+) Merging is intended for an environment like
the X Window System
with several shells in simultaneous use.  Currently it succeeds
only when the shells quit nicely one after another.

With \fB\-L\fR, the shell appends \fIfilename\fR, which is presumably a
history list saved by the \fB\-S\fR option or the \fBsavehist\fR mechanism,
to the history list.
\fB\-M\fR is like \fB\-L\fR, but the contents of \fIfilename\fR are merged
into the history list and sorted by timestamp.
In either case, \fBhistfile\fR is used if \fIfilename\fR is not given and
\fI~/.history\fR is used if \fBhistfile\fR is unset.
`history \-L' is exactly like 'source \-h' except that it does not require a
filename.
.PP
Note that login shells do the equivalent of `history \-L' on startup
and, if \fBsavehist\fR is set, `history \-S' before exiting.
Because only \fI~/.tcshrc\fR is normally sourced before \fI~/.history\fR,
\fBhistfile\fR should be set in \fI~/.tcshrc\fR rather than \fI~/.login\fR.

It is possible to miss the exact time when the command is to be run, but
an overdue command will execute at the next prompt.
A command which comes due while the shell
is waiting for user input is executed immediately.
However, normal operation of an already-running command will not
be interrupted so that a scheduled-event list element may be run.

This mechanism is similar to, but not the same as, the \fIat\fR(1)

Its major disadvantage is that it may not run a command at exactly the

Its major advantage is that because \fIsched\fR runs directly from

Controls which tty modes (see \fBTerminal management\fR)
the shell does not allow to change.
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-x\fR tells \fIsetty\fR to act
on the `edit', `quote' or `execute' set of tty modes respectively; without
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-x\fR, `execute' is used.
.IP "" 8
Without other arguments, \fIsetty\fR lists the modes in the chosen set
which are fixed on (`+mode') or off (`\-mode').
The available modes, and thus the display, vary from system to system.
With \fB\-a\fR, lists all tty modes in the chosen set
whether or not they are fixed.
With \fB+\fImode\fR, \fB\-\fImode\fR or \fImode\fR, fixes \fImode\fR on or off
or removes control from \fImode\fR in the chosen set.
For example, `setty +echok echoe' fixes `echok' mode on and allows commands
to turn `echoe' mode on or off, both when the shell is executing commands.
.TP 8
.B setxvers\fR [\fIstring\fR] (+)
Set the experimental version prefix to \fIstring\fR, or removes it
if \fIstring\fR is omitted.  (TCF only)
.TP 8
.B shift \fR[\fIvariable\fR]
Without arguments, discards \fBargv\fR[1] and shifts the members of
\fBargv\fR to the left.  It is an error for \fBargv\fR not to be set or to have
less than one word as value.  With \fIvariable\fR, performs the
same function on \fIvariable\fR.
.TP 8
.B source \fR[\fB\-h\fR] \fIname\fR [\fIargs\fR ...]
The shell reads and executes commands from \fIname\fR.
The commands are not placed on the history list.
If any \fIargs\fR are given, they are placed in \fBargv\fR.  (+)
\fIsource\fR commands may be nested;
if they are nested too deeply the shell may run out of file descriptors.
An error in a \fIsource\fR at any level terminates all nested
\fIsource\fR commands.
With \fB\-h\fR, commands are placed on the history list instead of being
executed, much like `history \-L'.
.TP 8
.B stop \fB%\fIjob\fR|\fIpid\fR ...
Stops the specified jobs or processes which are executing in the background.
\fIjob\fR may be a number, a string, `', `%', `+' or `\-' as described
under \fBJobs\fR.
There is no default \fIjob\fR; saying just `stop' does not stop
the current job.
.TP 8
.B suspend
Causes the shell to stop in its tracks, much as if it had
been sent a stop signal with \fB^Z\fR.  This is most often used to

Each case label is successively matched, against the

The file metacharacters `*', `?' and `[...]'  may be used
in the case labels, which are variable expanded.  If none
of the labels match before a `default' label is found, then
the execution begins after the default label.  Each case
label and the default label must appear at the beginning of
a line.  The command \fIbreaksw\fR causes execution to continue
after the \fIendsw\fR.  Otherwise control may fall through case
labels and default labels as in C.  If no label matches and
there is no default, execution continues after the \fIendsw\fR.

.TP 8
.B telltc \fR(+)
Lists the values of all terminal capabilities (see \fItermcap\fR(5)).

Tests if \fIterminal type\fR (or the current value of \fBTERM\fR if no
\fIterminal type\fR is given) has an entry in the hosts termcap(5) or
terminfo(5) database. Prints the terminal type to stdout and returns 0
if an entry is present otherwise returns 1.
.TP 8
.B time \fR[\fIcommand\fR]
Executes \fIcommand\fR (which must be a simple command, not an alias,
a pipeline, a command list or a parenthesized command list)
and prints a time summary as described under the \fBtime\fR variable.
If necessary, an extra shell is created to print the time statistic when
the command completes.
Without \fIcommand\fR, prints a time summary for the current shell and its
children.
.TP 8
.B umask \fR[\fIvalue\fR]
Sets the file creation mask to \fIvalue\fR, which is given in octal.
Common values for the mask are
002, giving all access to the group and read and execute access to others, and
022, giving read and execute access to the group and others.
Without \fIvalue\fR, prints the current file creation mask.

With \fB\-h\fR, the corresponding hard limits are removed.
Only the super-user may do this.
Note that \fBunlimit\fR may not exit successful, since most systems
do not allow \fIdescriptors\fR to be unlimited.
With \fB\-f\fR errors are ignored.
.TP 8
.B unset \fIpattern
Removes all variables whose names match \fIpattern\fR, unless they are read-only.

evaluates non-zero.
\fIwhile\fR and \fIend\fR must appear alone on their input lines.

.B beepcmd
Runs when the shell wants to ring the terminal bell.
.TP 8
.B cwdcmd
Runs after every change of working directory.  For example, if the user is
working on an X window system using \fIxterm\fR(1) and a re-parenting window
manager that supports title bars such as \fItwm\fR(1) and does
.RS +8
.IP "" 4
> alias cwdcmd  'echo \-n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^G"'
.PP
then the shell will change the title of the running \fIxterm\fR(1)
to be the name of the host, a colon, and the full current working directory.
A fancier way to do that is
.IP "" 4
> alias cwdcmd 'echo \-n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"'
.PP
This will put the hostname and working directory on the title bar but
only the hostname in the icon manager menu.
.PP
Note that putting a \fIcd\fR, \fIpushd\fR or \fIpopd\fR in \fIcwdcmd\fR
may cause an infinite loop.  It is the author's opinion that anyone doing
so will get what they deserve.

.SS "Special shell variables"
The variables described in this section have special meaning to the shell.

\fBtcsh\fR, \fBterm\fR, \fBtty\fR, \fBuid\fR, \fBuser\fR and \fBversion\fR at
startup; they do not change thereafter unless changed by the user.  The shell
updates \fBcwd\fR, \fBdirstack\fR, \fBowd\fR and \fBstatus\fR when necessary,
and sets \fBlogout\fR on logout.
.PP
The shell synchronizes \fBgroup\fR, \fBhome\fR, \fBpath\fR, \fBshlvl\fR,
\fBterm\fR and \fBuser\fR with the environment variables of the same names:
whenever the environment variable changes the shell changes the corresponding
shell variable to match (unless the shell variable is read-only) and vice
versa.  Note that although \fBcwd\fR and \fBPWD\fR have identical meanings, they
are not synchronized in this manner, and that the shell automatically
interconverts the different formats of \fBpath\fR and \fBPATH\fR.
.TP 8
.B addsuffix \fR(+)
If set, filename completion adds `/' to the end of directories and a space
to the end of normal files when they are matched exactly.

.TP 8
.B afsuser \fR(+)
If set, \fBautologout\fR's autolock feature uses its value instead of
the local username for kerberos authentication.
.TP 8
.B ampm \fR(+)

.TP 8
.B argv
The arguments to the shell.  Positional parameters are taken from \fBargv\fR,
i.e., `$1' is replaced by `$argv[1]', etc.
Set by default, but usually empty in interactive shells.
.TP 8
.B autocorrect \fR(+)
If set, the \fIspell-word\fR editor command is invoked automatically before
each completion attempt.
.TP 8
.B autoexpand \fR(+)
If set, the \fIexpand-history\fR editor command is invoked automatically
before each completion attempt. If this is set to \fIonlyhistory\fR, then
only history will be expanded and a second completion will expand filenames.
.TP 8
.B autolist \fR(+)
If set, possibilities are listed after an ambiguous completion.
If set to `ambiguous', possibilities are listed only when no new
characters are added by completion.
.TP 8
.B autologout \fR(+)
The first word is the number of minutes of inactivity before automatic
logout.  The optional second word is the number of minutes of inactivity
before automatic locking.
When the shell automatically logs out, it prints `auto-logout', sets the
variable \fBlogout\fR to `automatic' and exits.
When the shell automatically locks, the user is required to enter his password
to continue working.  Five incorrect attempts result in automatic logout.
Set to `60' (automatic logout after 60 minutes, and no locking) by default
in login and superuser shells, but not if the shell thinks it is running
under a window system (i.e., the \fBDISPLAY\fR environment variable is set),
the tty is a pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so compiled (see the
\fBversion\fR shell variable).
See also the \fBafsuser\fR and \fBlogout\fR shell variables.
.TP 8
.B autorehash \fR(+)
If set, the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in the
\fBpath\fR variable will be recomputed if a command is not found in the hash
table.  In addition, the list of available commands will be rebuilt for each
command completion or spelling correction attempt if set to `complete' or
`correct' respectively; if set to `always', this will be done for both
cases.
.TP 8
.B backslash_quote \fR(+)
If set, backslashes (`\\') always quote `\\', `'', and `"'.  This may make
complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in \fIcsh\fR(1)

.TP 8
.B catalog
The file name of the message catalog.
If set, tcsh use `tcsh.${catalog}' as a message catalog instead of
default `tcsh'.
.TP 8

A list of directories in which \fIcd\fR should search for
subdirectories if they aren't found in the current directory.

.B color
If set, it enables color display for the builtin \fBls\-F\fR and it passes
\fB\-\-color=auto\fR to \fBls\fR.  Alternatively, it can be set to only
\fBls\-F\fR or only \fBls\fR to enable color to only one command.  Setting
it to nothing is equivalent to setting it to \fB(ls\-F ls)\fR.

.TP 8
.B compat_expr \fR(+)
If set, the shell will evaluate expressions right to left, like the original
\fIcsh\fR.
.TP 8
.B complete \fR(+)
If set to `igncase', the completion becomes case insensitive.
If set to `enhance', completion ignores case and considers
hyphens and underscores to be equivalent; it will also treat
periods, hyphens and underscores (`.', `\-' and `_') as word
separators.
If set to `Enhance', completion matches uppercase and underscore
characters explicitly and matches lowercase and hyphens in a
case-insensivite manner; it will treat periods, hypens and underscores

.TP 8
.B dextract \fR(+)
If set, `pushd +\fIn\fR' extracts the \fIn\fRth directory from the directory
stack rather than rotating it to the top.
.TP 8
.B dirsfile \fR(+)
The default location in which `dirs \-S' and `dirs \-L' look for
a history file.  If unset, \fI~/.cshdirs\fR is used.
Because only \fI~/.tcshrc\fR is normally sourced before \fI~/.cshdirs\fR,
\fBdirsfile\fR should be set in \fI~/.tcshrc\fR rather than \fI~/.login\fR.
.TP 8
.B dirstack \fR(+)
An array of all the directories on the directory stack.
`$dirstack[1]' is the current working directory, `$dirstack[2]'
the first directory on the stack, etc.
Note that the current working directory is `$dirstack[1]' but `=0' in
directory stack substitutions, etc.
One can change the stack arbitrarily by setting \fBdirstack\fR,
but the first element (the current working directory) is always correct.
See also the \fBcwd\fR and \fBowd\fR shell variables.

.B dspmbyte \fR(+)
Has an effect iff 'dspm' is listed as part of the \fBversion\fR shell variable.
If set to `euc', it enables display and editing EUC-kanji(Japanese) code.
If set to `sjis', it enables display and editing Shift-JIS(Japanese) code.
If set to `big5', it enables display and editing Big5(Chinese) code.

If set to `001322', the first character (means 0x00 of the ASCII code) and
second character (means 0x01 of ASCII code) are set to `0'.  Then, it is not
used for multi-byte characters.  The 3rd character (0x02) is set to '1',
indicating that it is used for the first byte of a multi-byte character.
The 4th character(0x03) is set '3'.  It is used for both the first byte and
the second byte of a multi-byte character.  The 5th and 6th characters
(0x04,0x05) are set to '2', indicating that they are used for the second
byte of a multi-byte character.
.PP
The GNU fileutils version of ls cannot display multi-byte
filenames without the -N ( --literal ) option.   If you are using
this version, set the second word of dspmbyte to "ls".  If not, for

.TP 8
.B ellipsis \fR(+)
If set, the `%c'/`%.' and `%C' prompt sequences (see the \fBprompt\fR
shell variable) indicate skipped directories with an ellipsis (`...')
instead of `/<skipped>'.
.TP 8
.B euid \fR(+)

.TP 8
.B euser \fR(+)
The first matching passwd entry name corresponding to the effective user ID.
.TP 8
.B fignore \fR(+)
Lists file name suffixes to be ignored by completion.
.TP 8
.B filec
In \fItcsh\fR, completion is always used and this variable is ignored
by default. If 
.B edit
is unset, then the traditional \fIcsh\fR completion is used.
If set in \fIcsh\fR, filename completion is used.
.TP 8
.B gid \fR(+)
The user's real group ID.
.TP 8
.B globdot \fR(+)
If set, wild-card glob patterns will match files and directories beginning
with `.' except for `.' and `..'
.TP 8
.B globstar \fR(+)
If set, the `**' and `***' file glob patterns will match any string of 
characters including `/' traversing any existing sub-directories.  (e.g. 
`ls **.c' will list all the .c files in the current directory tree).
If used by itself, it will match match zero or more sub-directories
(e.g. `ls /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h'
in the /usr/include directory tree; whereas `ls /usr/include/**time.h'
will match any file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h').
To prevent problems with recursion, the `**' glob-pattern will not 
descend into a symbolic link containing a directory.  To override this,
use `***'
.TP 8
.B group \fR(+)
The user's group name.
.TP 8
.B highlight
If set, the incremental search match (in \fIi-search-back\fR and
\fIi-search-fwd\fR) and the region between the mark and the cursor are
highlighted in reverse video.
.IP "" 8
Highlighting requires more frequent terminal writes, which introduces extra
overhead. If you care about terminal performance, you may want to leave this
unset.
.TP 8
.B histchars
A string value determining the characters used in \fBHistory
substitution\fR (q.v.).  The first character of its value is used as
the history substitution character, replacing the default character
`!'.  The second character of its value replaces the character `^' in
quick substitutions.
.TP 8
.B histdup \fR(+)
Controls handling of duplicate entries in the history list.  If set to
`all' only unique history events are entered in the history list.  If
set to `prev' and the last history event is the same as the current
command, then the current command is not entered in the history.  If
set to `erase' and the same event is found in the history list, that
old event gets erased and the current one gets inserted.  Note that the
`prev' and `all' options renumber history events so there are no gaps.
.TP 8
.B histfile \fR(+)
The default location in which `history \-S' and `history \-L' look for
a history file.  If unset, \fI~/.history\fR is used.  \fBhistfile\fR is
useful when sharing the same home directory between different machines,
or when saving separate histories on different terminals.  Because only
\fI~/.tcshrc\fR is normally sourced before \fI~/.history\fR,
\fBhistfile\fR should be set in \fI~/.tcshrc\fR rather than
\fI~/.login\fR.
.TP 8
.B histlit \fR(+)
If set, builtin and editor commands and the \fBsavehist\fR mechanism
use the literal (unexpanded) form of lines in the history list.  See
also the \fItoggle-literal-history\fR editor command.
.TP 8
.B history
The first word indicates the number of history events to save.  The
optional second word (+) indicates the format in which history is
printed; if not given, `%h\\t%T\\t%R\\n' is used.  The format sequences
are described below under \fBprompt\fR; note the variable meaning of
`%R'.  Set to `100' by default.
.TP 8
.B home
Initialized to the home directory of the invoker.  The filename
expansion of `\fI~\fR' refers to this variable.
.TP 8
.B ignoreeof
If set to the empty string or `0' and the input device is a terminal,
the \fIend-of-file\fR command (usually generated by the user by typing
`^D' on an empty line) causes the shell to print `Use "exit" to leave
tcsh.' instead of exiting.  This prevents the shell from accidentally
being killed.  Historically this setting exited after 26 successive
EOF's to avoid infinite loops.  If set to a number \fIn\fR, the shell
ignores \fIn - 1\fR consecutive \fIend-of-file\fRs and exits on the
\fIn\fRth.  (+) If unset, `1' is used, i.e., the shell exits on a
single `^D'.
.TP 8
.B implicitcd \fR(+)
If set, the shell treats a directory name typed as a command as though
it were a request to change to that directory.  If set to \fIverbose\fR,
the change of directory is echoed to the standard output.  This behavior
is inhibited in non-interactive shell scripts, or for command strings
with more than one word.  Changing directory takes precedence over
executing a like-named command, but it is done after alias
substitutions.  Tilde and variable expansions work as expected.
.TP 8
.B inputmode \fR(+)
If set to `insert' or `overwrite', puts the editor into that input mode
at the beginning of each line.
.TP 8
.B killdup \fR(+)
Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring.  If set to
`all' only unique strings are entered in the kill ring.  If set to
`prev' and the last killed string is the same as the current killed
string, then the current string is not entered in the ring.  If set
to `erase' and the same string is found in the kill ring, the old
string is erased and the current one is inserted.
.TP 8
.B killring \fR(+)
Indicates the number of killed strings to keep in memory.  Set to `30'
by default.  If unset or set to less than `2', the shell will only
keep the most recently killed string.
Strings are put in the killring by the editor commands that delete
(kill) strings of text, e.g. \fIbackward-delete-word\fR,
\fIkill-line\fR, etc, as well as the \fIcopy-region-as-kill\fR command.
The \fIyank\fR editor command will yank the most recently killed string
into the command-line, while \fIyank-pop\fR (see \fBEditor commands\fR)
can be used to yank earlier killed strings.
.TP 8
.B listflags \fR(+)
If set to `x', `a' or `A', or any combination thereof (e.g., `xA'), they
are used as flags to \fIls\-F\fR, making it act like `ls \-xF', `ls
\-Fa', `ls \-FA' or a combination (e.g., `ls \-FxA'): `a' shows all
files (even if they start with a `.'), `A' shows all files but `.' and
`..', and `x' sorts across instead of down.  If the second word of
\fBlistflags\fR is set, it is used as the path to `ls(1)'.
.TP 8
.B listjobs \fR(+)
If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended.  If set to `long',
the listing is in long format.
.TP 8
.B listlinks \fR(+)
If set, the \fIls\-F\fR builtin command shows the type of file to which
each symbolic link points.
.TP 8
.B listmax \fR(+)
The maximum number of items which the \fIlist-choices\fR editor command
will list without asking first.
.TP 8
.B listmaxrows \fR(+)
The maximum number of rows of items which the \fIlist-choices\fR editor
command will list without asking first.
.TP 8
.B loginsh \fR(+)
Set by the shell if it is a login shell.  Setting or unsetting it
within a shell has no effect.  See also \fBshlvl\fR.
.TP 8
.B logout \fR(+)
Set by the shell to `normal' before a normal logout, `automatic' before
an automatic logout, and `hangup' if the shell was killed by a hangup
signal (see \fBSignal handling\fR).  See also the \fBautologout\fR
shell variable.
.TP 8
.B mail
A list of files and directories to check for incoming mail, optionally
preceded by a numeric word.  Before each prompt, if 10 minutes have
passed since the last check, the shell checks each file and says `You
have new mail.' (or, if \fBmail\fR contains multiple files, `You have
new mail in \fIname\fR.') if the filesize is greater than zero in size
and has a modification time greater than its access time.
.PP
.RS +8
.PD
.PP
If you are in a login shell, then no mail file is reported unless it has
been modified after the time the shell has started up, to prevent
redundant notifications.  Most login programs will tell you whether or not
you have mail when you log in.
.PP
If a file specified in \fBmail\fR is a directory, the shell will count each
file within that directory as a separate message, and will report `You have
\fIn\fR mails.' or `You have \fIn\fR mails in \fIname\fR.' as appropriate.
This functionality is provided primarily for those systems which store mail
in this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.
.PP
If the first word of \fBmail\fR is numeric it is taken as a different mail
checking interval, in seconds.
.PP
Under very rare circumstances, the shell may report `You have mail.' instead
of `You have new mail.'
.RE
.TP 8
.B matchbeep \fR(+)
If set to `never', completion never beeps.
If set to `nomatch', it beeps only when there is no match.
If set to `ambiguous', it beeps when there are multiple matches.
If set to `notunique', it beeps when there is one exact and other longer matches.
If unset, `ambiguous' is used.
.TP 8
.B nobeep \fR(+)
If set, beeping is completely disabled.
See also \fBvisiblebell\fR.
.TP 8
.B noclobber
If set, restrictions are placed on output redirection to insure that files
are not accidentally destroyed and that `>>' redirections refer to existing
files, as described in the \fBInput/output\fR section.
.TP 8
.B noding
If set, disable the printing of `DING!' in the \fBprompt\fR time
specifiers at the change of hour.
.TP 8
.B noglob
If set, \fBFilename substitution\fR and \fBDirectory stack substitution\fR
(q.v.) are inhibited.  This is most useful in shell scripts which do not deal
with filenames, or after a list of filenames has been obtained and further
expansions are not desirable.
.TP 8
.B nokanji \fR(+)
If set and the shell supports Kanji (see the \fBversion\fR shell variable),
it is disabled so that the meta key can be used.
.TP 8
.B nonomatch
If set, a \fBFilename substitution\fR or \fBDirectory stack substitution\fR
(q.v.) which does not match any
existing files is left untouched rather than causing an error.
It is still an error for the substitution to be
malformed, e.g., `echo [' still gives an error.
.TP 8
.B nostat \fR(+)
A list of directories (or glob-patterns which match directories; see
\fBFilename substitution\fR) that should not be \fIstat\fR(2)ed during a
completion operation.  This is usually used to exclude directories which
take too much time to \fIstat\fR(2), for example \fI/afs\fR.
.TP 8
.B notify
If set, the shell announces job completions asynchronously.
The default is to present job completions just before printing a prompt.
.TP 8
.B oid \fR(+)
The user's real organization ID.  (Domain/OS only)
.TP 8
.B owd \fR(+)
The old working directory, equivalent to the `\-' used by \fIcd\fR and \fIpushd\fR.
See also the \fBcwd\fR and \fBdirstack\fR shell variables.
.TP 8
.B padhour
If set, enable the printing of padding '0' for hours, in 24 and 12 hour
formats.  E.G.: 07:45:42 vs. 7:45:42.
.TP 8
.B parseoctal
To retain compatibily with older versions numeric variables starting with
0 are not interpreted as octal. Setting this variable enables proper octal
parsing.
.TP 8
.B path
A list of directories in which to look for executable commands.
A null word specifies the current directory.
If there is no \fBpath\fR variable then only full path names will execute.
\fBpath\fR is set by the shell at startup from the \fBPATH\fR environment
variable or, if \fBPATH\fR does not exist, to a system-dependent default
something like `(/usr/local/bin /usr/bsd /bin /usr/bin .)'.
The shell may put `.' first or last in \fBpath\fR or omit it entirely
depending on how it was compiled; see the \fBversion\fR shell variable.
A shell which is given neither the \fB\-c\fR nor the \fB\-t\fR option
hashes the contents of the directories in \fBpath\fR after
reading \fI~/.tcshrc\fR and each time \fBpath\fR is reset.
If one adds a new command to a directory in \fBpath\fR while the shell
is active, one may need to do a \fIrehash\fR for the shell to find it.
.TP 8
.B printexitvalue \fR(+)
If set and an interactive program exits with a non-zero status, the shell
prints `Exit \fBstatus\fR'.
.TP 8
.B prompt
The string which is printed before reading each command from the terminal.
\fBprompt\fR may include any of the following formatting sequences (+), which
are replaced by the given information:
.PP
.RS +8
.PD 0
.TP 4
%/
The current working directory.
.TP 4
%~
The current working directory, but with one's home directory
represented by `~' and other users' home directories represented by
`~user' as per \fBFilename substitution\fR.  `~user' substitution
happens only if the shell has already used `~\fIuser\fR' in a pathname
in the current session.
.TP 4
%c[[0]\fIn\fR], %.[[0]\fIn\fR]
The trailing component of the current working directory, or \fIn\fR
trailing components if a digit \fIn\fR is given.
If \fIn\fR begins with `0', the number of skipped components precede
the trailing component(s) in the format `/<\fIskipped\fR>trailing'.
If the \fBellipsis\fR shell variable is set, skipped components
are represented by an ellipsis so the whole becomes `...trailing'.
`~' substitution is done as in `%~' above, but the `~' component
is ignored when counting trailing components.
.TP 4
%C
Like %c, but without `~' substitution.
.TP 4
%h, %!, !
The current history event number.
.TP 4
%M
The full hostname.

Like `%t', but in 24-hour format (but see the \fBampm\fR shell variable).
.TP 4
%p
The `precise' time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format, with seconds.
.TP 4
%P
Like `%p', but in 24-hour format (but see the \fBampm\fR shell variable).
.TP 4
\e\fIc\fR
\fIc\fR is parsed as in \fIbindkey\fR.
.TP 4
^\fIc\fR
\fIc\fR is parsed as in \fIbindkey\fR.

`>' (or the first character of the \fBpromptchars\fR shell variable)
for normal users, `#' (or the second character of \fBpromptchars\fR)
for the superuser.
.TP 4
%{\fIstring\fR%}
Includes \fIstring\fR as a literal escape sequence.
It should be used only to change terminal attributes and
should not move the cursor location.  This
cannot be the last sequence in \fBprompt\fR.
.TP 4
%?
The return code of the command executed just before the prompt.
.TP 4
%R
In \fBprompt2\fR, the status of the parser.
In \fBprompt3\fR, the corrected string.
In \fBhistory\fR, the history string.
.PD
.PP
`%B', `%S', `%U' and `%{\fIstring\fR%}' are available in only
eight-bit-clean shells; see the \fBversion\fR shell variable.
.PP
The bold, standout and underline sequences are often used to distinguish a
superuser shell.  For example,
.IP "" 4
> set prompt = "%m [%h] %B[%@]%b [%/] you rang? "
.br
tut [37] \fB[2:54pm]\fR [/usr/accts/sys] you rang? _
.PP
If `%t', `%@', `%T', `%p', or `%P' is used, and \fBnoding\fR is not set,
then print `DING!' on the change of hour (i.e, `:00' minutes) instead of
the actual time.
.PP
Set by default to `%# ' in interactive shells.
.RE
.TP 8
.B prompt2 \fR(+)
The string with which to prompt in \fIwhile\fR and \fIforeach\fR loops and

.TP 8
.B prompt3 \fR(+)
The string with which to prompt when confirming automatic spelling correction.
The same format sequences may be used as in \fBprompt\fR (q.v.);
note the variable meaning of `%R'.
Set by default to `CORRECT>%R (y|n|e|a)? ' in interactive shells.
.TP 8
.B promptchars \fR(+)
If set (to a two-character string), the `%#' formatting sequence in the
\fBprompt\fR shell variable is replaced with the first character for
normal users and the second character for the superuser.
.TP 8
.B pushdtohome \fR(+)
If set, \fIpushd\fR without arguments does `pushd ~', like \fIcd\fR.
.TP 8
.B pushdsilent \fR(+)
If set, \fIpushd\fR and \fIpopd\fR do not print the directory stack.
.TP 8
.B recexact \fR(+)
If set, completion completes on an exact match even if a longer match is
possible.
.TP 8
.B recognize_only_executables \fR(+)
If set, command listing displays only files in the path that are
executable.  Slow.
.TP 8
.B rmstar \fR(+)
If set, the user is prompted before `rm *' is executed.
.TP 8
.B rprompt \fR(+)
The string to print on the right-hand side of the screen (after
the command input) when the prompt is being displayed on the left.
It recognizes the same formatting characters as \fBprompt\fR.
It will automatically disappear and reappear as necessary, to ensure that
command input isn't obscured, and will appear only if the prompt,
command input, and itself will fit together on the first line.
If \fBedit\fR isn't set, then \fBrprompt\fR will be printed after
the prompt and before the command input.
.TP 8
.B savedirs \fR(+)
If set, the shell does `dirs \-S' before exiting.
If the first word is set to a number, at most that many directory stack
entries are saved.
.TP 8
.B savehist
If set, the shell does `history \-S' before exiting.
If the first word is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved.
(The number must be less than or equal to \fBhistory\fR.)
If the second word is set to `merge', the history list is merged with
the existing history file instead of replacing it (if there is one) and
sorted by time stamp and the most recent events are retained.  (+)
.TP 8
.B sched \fR(+)
The format in which the \fIsched\fR builtin command prints scheduled events;
if not given, `%h\\t%T\\t%R\\n' is used.
The format sequences are described above under \fBprompt\fR;
note the variable meaning of `%R'.
.TP 8
.B shell
The file in which the shell resides.  This is used in forking
shells to interpret files which have execute bits set, but
which are not executable by the system.  (See the description
of \fBBuiltin and non-builtin command execution\fR.)  Initialized to the
(system-dependent) home of the shell.
.TP 8
.B shlvl \fR(+)
The number of nested shells.
Reset to 1 in login shells.
See also \fBloginsh\fR.
.TP 8
.B status
The status returned by the last command, unless the variable
.B anyerror
is set, and any error in a pipeline or a backquote expansion will be
propagated (this is the default
.B csh
behavior, and the current
.B tcsh
default). If it terminated
abnormally, then 0200 is added to the status.  Builtin commands
which fail return exit status `1', all other builtin commands
return status `0'.
.TP 8
.B symlinks \fR(+)
Can be set to several different values to control symbolic link (`symlink')
resolution:
.RS +8
.PP
If set to `chase', whenever the current directory changes to a directory
containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to the real name of the directory
to which the link points.  This does not work for the user's home directory;
this is a bug.
.PP
If set to `ignore', the shell tries to construct a current directory
relative to the current directory before the link was crossed.
This means that \fIcd\fRing through a symbolic link and then `cd ..'ing
returns one to the original directory.  This affects only builtin commands
and filename completion.
.PP
If set to `expand', the shell tries to fix symbolic links by actually expanding
arguments which look like path names.  This affects any command, not just
builtins.  Unfortunately, this does not work for hard-to-recognize filenames,
such as those embedded in command options.  Expansion may be prevented by
quoting.  While this setting is usually the most convenient, it is sometimes
misleading and sometimes confusing when it fails to recognize an argument
which should be expanded.  A compromise is to use `ignore' and use the
editor command \fInormalize-path\fR (bound by default to ^X-n) when necessary.
.PP
Some examples are in order.  First, let's set up some play directories:
.IP "" 4
> cd /tmp
.br
> mkdir from from/src to
.br
> ln \-s from/src to/dst
.PP
Here's the behavior with \fBsymlinks\fR unset,
.IP "" 4
> cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/to/dst
.br
> cd ..; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/from
.PP
here's the behavior with \fBsymlinks\fR set to `chase',
.IP "" 4
> cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/from/src
.br
> cd ..; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/from
.PP
here's the behavior with \fBsymlinks\fR set to `ignore',
.IP "" 4
> cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/to/dst
.br
> cd ..; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/to
.PP
and here's the behavior with \fBsymlinks\fR set to `expand'.
.IP "" 4
> cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/to/dst
.br
> cd ..; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/to
.br

> cd ".."; echo $cwd
.br
/tmp/from
.br
> /bin/echo ..
.br
/tmp/to
.br
> /bin/echo ".."
.br
\&..
.PP
Note that `expand' expansion 1) works just like `ignore' for builtins
like \fIcd\fR, 2) is prevented by quoting, and 3) happens before
filenames are passed to non-builtin commands.
.RE
.TP 8

.IP "" 4
set watch = (george ttyd1 any console $user any)
.PP

oneself (or a trespasser) on any terminal.

Logins and logouts are checked every 10 minutes by default, but the first
word of \fBwatch\fR can be set to a number to check every so many minutes.
For example,
.IP "" 4
set watch = (1 any any)
.PP

builtin command triggers a \fBwatch\fR report at any time.  All current logins
are reported (as with the \fIlog\fR builtin) when \fBwatch\fR is first set.

You need to include only the variables you want to change from
the default.
.PP
File names can also be colorized based on filename extension.
This is specified in the \fBLS_COLORS\fR variable using the syntax
\fB"*ext=string"\fR.  For example, using ISO 6429 codes, to color
all C\-language source files blue you would specify \fB"*.c=34"\fR.
This would color all files ending in \fB.c\fR in blue (34) color.
.PP
Control characters can be written either in C\-style\-escaped
notation, or in stty\-like ^\-notation.  The C\-style notation
adds \fB^[\fR for Escape, \fB\_\fR for a normal space character,
and \fB?\fR for Delete.  In addition, the \fB^[\fR escape character
can be used to override the default interpretation of \fB^[\fR,
\fB^\fR, \fB:\fR and \fB=\fR.
.PP
Each file will be written as \fB<lc>\fR \fB<color-code>\fR
\fB<rc>\fR \fB<filename>\fR \fB<ec>\fR.  If the \fB<ec>\fR
code is undefined, the sequence \fB<lc>\fR \fB<no>
\fB<rc>\fR will be used instead.  This is generally more convenient
to use, but less general.  The left, right and end codes are
provided so you don't have to type common parts over and over
again and to support weird terminals; you will generally not
need to change them at all unless your terminal does not use
ISO 6429 color sequences but a different system.
.PP
If your terminal does use ISO 6429 color codes, you can
compose the type codes (i.e., all except the \fBlc\fR, \fBrc\fR,
and \fBec\fR codes) from numerical commands separated by semicolons.  The
most common commands are:

A few terminal programs do not recognize the default end code

.PP
Read-only variables.  See \fBVariable substitution\fR.
.SH BUGS
When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory
it started in if this is different from the current directory.  This can
be misleading (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories internally.
.PP
Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable.  Command sequences
of the form `a ; b ; c' are also not handled gracefully when stopping is
attempted.  If you suspend `b', the shell will then immediately execute
`c'.  This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from an
\fIalias\fR.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands in ()'s to force it
to a subshell, i.e., `( a ; b ; c )'.
.PP
Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps
this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal interface.
In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting things could be
done with output control.
.PP
Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell procedures;
shell procedures should be provided rather than aliases.
.PP
Control structures should be parsed rather than being recognized as
built-in commands.  This would allow control commands to be placed anywhere,
to be combined with `|', and to be used with `&' and `;' metasyntax.
.PP
\fIforeach\fR doesn't ignore here documents when looking for its \fIend\fR.
.PP
It should be possible to use the `:' modifiers on the output of command
substitutions.
.PP
The screen update for lines longer than the screen width is very poor
if the terminal cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type `dumb').
.PP
\fBHPATH\fR and \fBNOREBIND\fR don't need to be environment variables.
.PP
Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*' or `[]' or which use `{}' or `~'
are not negated correctly.
.PP
The single-command form of \fIif\fR does output redirection even if
the expression is false and the command is not executed.
.PP
\fIls\-F\fR includes file identification characters when sorting filenames
and does not handle control characters in filenames well.  It cannot be
interrupted.
.PP
Command substitution supports multiple commands and conditions, but not
cycles or backward \fIgoto\fRs.
.PP

.SH THE T IN TCSH
In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6.  The PDP-10 was a later re-implementation.  It
was re-christened the DECsystem-10 in 1970 or so when DEC brought out the
second model, the KI10.
.PP
TENEX was created at Bolt, Beranek & Newman (a Cambridge, Massachusetts
think tank) in
1972 as an experiment in demand-paged virtual memory operating systems.  They
built a new pager for the DEC PDP-10 and created the OS to go with it.  It was
extremely successful in academia.
.PP
In 1975, DEC brought out a new model of the PDP-10, the KL10; they intended to
have only a version of TENEX, which they had licensed from BBN, for the new
box.  They called their version TOPS-20 (their capitalization is trademarked).
A lot of TOPS-10 users (`The OPerating System for PDP-10') objected; thus DEC
found themselves supporting two incompatible systems on the same hardware--but
then there were 6 on the PDP-11!
.PP
TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3, had command completion
via a user-code-level subroutine library called ULTCMD.  With version 3, DEC
moved all that capability and more into the monitor (`kernel' for you Unix
types), accessed by the COMND% JSYS (`Jump to SYStem' instruction, the
supervisor call mechanism [are my IBM roots also showing?]).
.PP
The creator of tcsh was impressed by this feature and several others of TENEX
and TOPS-20, and created a version of csh which mimicked them.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The system limits argument lists to ARG_MAX characters.
.PP
The number of arguments to a command which involves filename expansion is
limited to 1/6th the number of characters allowed in an argument list.
.PP
Command substitutions may substitute no more characters than are allowed in
an argument list.
.PP
To detect looping, the shell restricts the number of \fIalias\fR
substitutions on a single line to 20.

.Op Fl ks
.Op Fl f Ar prefix
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Ar file args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility splits
.Ar file
into pieces using the patterns
.Ar args .
If
.Ar file
is
a dash
.Pq Sq Fl ,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar prefix
Give created files names beginning with
.Ar prefix .
The default is
.Dq Pa xx .
.It Fl k
Do not remove output files if an error occurs or a
.Dv HUP ,
.Dv INT
or
.Dv TERM
signal is received.
.It Fl n Ar number
Use
.Ar number
of decimal digits after the
.Ar prefix
to form the file name.
The default is 2.
.It Fl s
Do not write the size of each output file to standard output as it is
created.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar args
operands may be a combination of the following patterns:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Cm / Ar regexp Cm / Op Oo Cm + | - Oc Ar offset
.Sm on
.Xc
Create a file containing the input from the current line to (but not including)
the next line matching the given basic regular expression.
An optional
.Ar offset
from the line that matched may be specified.
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Cm % Ar regexp Cm % Op Oo Cm + | - Oc Ar offset
.Sm on
.Xc
Same as above but a file is not created for the output.
.It Ar line_no
Create containing the input from the current line to (but not including)
the specified line number.
.It Cm { Ns Ar num Ns Cm }
Repeat the previous pattern the specified number of times.
If it follows a line number pattern, a new file will be created for each
.Ar line_no
lines,
.Ar num
times.
The first line of the file is line number 1 for historic reasons.
.El
.Pp
After all the patterns have been processed, the remaining input data
(if there is any) will be written to a new file.
.Pp
Requesting to split at a line before the current line number or past the
end of the file will result in an error.

.Sh NAME
.Nm csreq
.Nd Expert tool for manipulating Code Signing Requirement data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" text dump
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar -r requirement-input
.Ar -t
.\" create binary form
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar -r requirement-input
.Ar -b outputfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manipulates Code Signing Requirement data.
It reads one requirement from a file or command arguments, converts it into
internal form, checks it, and then optionally outputs it in a different form.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar path
Requests that the requirement read be written in binary form to the path given.
.It Fl r Ar requirement-input
Specifies the input requirement. See "specifying requirements" below. This is
exactly the same format as is accepted by the -r and -R options of the codesign(1)
command.
.It Fl t
Requests that the requirement read be written as text to standard output.
.It Fl v
Increases the verbosity of output. Multiple instances of -v produce increasing levels
of commentary output.
.El
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
reads a Code Requirement and writes it to standard output as canonical source text.
Note that with text input, this actually compiles the requirement into internal
form and then converts it back to text, giving you the system's view of the requirement code.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
reads a Code Requirement and writes its binary representation to a file. This is the
same form produced by the SecRequirementCopyData API, and is readily acceptable
as input to Code Signing verification APIs. It can also be used as input to subsequent
invocations of
.Nm
by passing the filename to the -r option.
.Sh SPECIFYING REQUIREMENTS
The
.Ar requirement
argument (-r) can be given in various forms. A plain text argument is taken
to be a path to a file containing the requirement. This program will accept
both binary files containing properly compiled requirements code, and source files
that are automatically compiled for use.
An argument of "-" requests that the requirement(s) are read from standard input.
Again, standard input can contain either binary form or text.
Finally, an argument that begins with an equal sign "=" is taken as a literal
requirements source text, and is compiled accordingly for use.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To compile an explicit requirement program and write its binary form to file "output":
.Dl csreq -r="identifier com.foo.test" -b output.csreq
.Pp
To display the requirement program embedded at offset 1234 of file "foo":
.Dl tail -b 1234 foo | csreq -r- -t
.Sh FILES
.\" .Bl -tag -width /Library/Keychains/System.keychain -compact

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
program exits 0 on success or 1 on failure. Errors in arguments yield exit code 2.

.Nm
command first appeared in

.TH cu 1 "Taylor UUCP 1.07"
.SH NAME
cu \- Call up another system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cu
[ options ] [ system | phone | "dir" ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cu
command is used to call up another system and act as a dial in
terminal.  It can also do simple file transfers with no error
checking.

.I cu
takes a single argument, besides the options.  If the argument is the
string "dir" cu will make a direct connection to the port.  This may
only be used by users with write access to the port, as it permits
reprogramming the modem.

Otherwise, if the argument begins with a digit, it is taken to be a
phone number to call.  Otherwise, it is taken to be the name of a
system to call.  The
.B \-z
or
.B \-\-system
option may be used to name a system beginning with a digit, and the
.B \-c
or
.B \-\-phone
option may be used to name a phone number that does not begin with a
digit.

.I cu
locates a port to use in the UUCP configuration files.  If a simple
system name is given, it will select a port appropriate for that
system.  The
.B \-p, \-\-port, \-l, \-\-line, \-s
and
.B \-\-speed
options may be used to control the port selection.

When a connection is made to the remote system,
.I cu
forks into two processes.  One reads from the port and writes to the
terminal, while the other reads from the terminal and writes to the
port.

.I cu
provides several commands that may be used during the conversation.
The commands all begin with an escape character, initially
.B ~
(tilde).  The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of
a line.  To send an escape character to the remote system at the start
of a line, it must be entered twice.  All commands are either a single
character or a word beginning with
.B %
(percent sign).

.I cu
recognizes the following commands:

.TP 5
.B ~.
Terminate the conversation.
.TP 5
.B ~! command
Run command in a shell.  If command is empty, starts up a shell.
.TP 5
.B ~$ command
Run command, sending the standard output to the remote system.
.TP 5
.B ~| command
Run command, taking the standard input from the remote system.
.TP 5
.B ~+ command
Run command, taking the standard input from the remote system and
sending the standard output to the remote system.
.TP 5
.B ~#, ~%break
Send a break signal, if possible.
.TP 5
.B ~c directory, ~%cd directory
Change the local directory.
.TP 5
.B ~> file
Send a file to the remote system.  This just dumps the file over the
communication line.  It is assumed that the remote system is expecting
it.
.TP 5
.B ~<
Receive a file from the remote system.  This prompts for the local
file name and for the remote command to execute to begin the file
transfer.  It continues accepting data until the contents of the
.B eofread
variable are seen.
.TP 5
.B ~p from to, ~%put from to
Send a file to a remote Unix system.  This runs the appropriate
commands on the remote system.
.TP 5
.B ~t from to, ~%take from to
Retrieve a file from a remote Unix system.  This runs the appropriate
commands on the remote system.
.TP 5
.B ~s variable value
Set a
.I cu
variable to the given value.  If value is not given, the variable is
set to
.B true.
.TP 5
.B ~! variable
Set a
.I cu
variable to
.B false.
.TP 5
.B ~z
Suspend the cu session.  This is only supported on some systems.  On
systems for which ^Z may be used to suspend a job, 
.B ~^Z
will also suspend the session.
.TP 5
.B ~%nostop
Turn off XON/XOFF handling.
.TP 5
.B ~%stop
Turn on XON/XOFF handling.
.TP 5
.B ~v
List all the variables and their values.
.TP 5
.B ~?
List all commands.

.I cu
also supports several variables.  They may be listed with the
.B ~v
command, and set with the
.B ~s
or
.B ~!
commands.

.TP 5
.B escape
The escape character.  Initially
.B ~
(tilde).
.TP 5
.B delay
If this variable is true,
.I cu
will delay for a second after recognizing the escape character before
printing the name of the local system.  The default is true.
.TP 5
.B eol
The list of characters which are considered to finish a line.  The
escape character is only recognized after one of these is seen.  The
default is carriage return, ^U, ^C, ^O, ^D, ^S, ^Q, ^R.
.TP 5
.B binary
Whether to transfer binary data when sending a file.  If this is
false, then newlines in the file being sent are converted to carriage
returns.  The default is false.
.TP 5
.B binary-prefix
A string used before sending a binary character in a file transfer, if
the
.B binary
variable is true.  The default is ^V.
.TP 5
.B echo-check
Whether to check file transfers by examining what the remote system
echoes back.  This probably doesn't work very well.  The default is
false.
.TP 5
.B echonl
The character to look for after sending each line in a file.  The
default is carriage return.
.TP 5
.B timeout
The timeout to use, in seconds, when looking for a character, either
when doing echo checking or when looking for the
.B echonl
character.  The default is 30.
.TP 5
.B kill
The character to use delete a line if the echo check fails.  The
default is ^U.
.TP 5
.B resend
The number of times to resend a line if the echo check continues to
fail.  The default is 10.
.TP 5
.B eofwrite
The string to write after sending a file with the
.B ~>
command.  The default is ^D.
.TP 5
.B eofread
The string to look for when receiving a file with the
.B ~<
command.  The default is $, which is intended to be a typical shell
prompt.
.TP 5
.B verbose
Whether to print accumulated information during a file transfer.  The
default is true.
.SH OPTIONS

.TH curl-config 1 "25 Oct 2007" "Curl 7.17.1" "curl-config manual"
.SH NAME
curl-config \- Get information about a libcurl installation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B curl-config [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B curl-config
displays information about the curl and libcurl installation.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--ca"
Displays the built-in path to the CA cert bundle this libcurl uses.
.IP "--cc"
Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.
.IP "--cflags"
Set of compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when compiling files that use
libcurl. Currently that is only the include path to the curl include files.
.IP "--checkfor [version]"
Specify the oldest possible libcurl version string you want, and this
script will return 0 if the current installation is new enough or it
returns 1 and outputs a text saying that the current version is not new
enough. (Added in 7.15.4)
.IP "--configure"
Displays the arguments given to configure when building curl.
.IP "--feature"
Lists what particular main features the installed libcurl was built with. At
the time of writing, this list may include SSL, KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume
any particular order. The keywords will be separated by newlines. There may be
none, one, or several keywords in the list.
.IP "--help"
Displays the available options.
.IP "--libs"
Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options you will need in order
to link your application with libcurl.
.IP "--prefix"
This is the prefix used when libcurl was installed. Libcurl is then installed
in $prefix/lib and its header files are installed in $prefix/include and so
on. The prefix is set with "configure --prefix".
.IP "--protocols"
Lists what particular protocols the installed libcurl was built to support. At
the time of writing, this list may include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FILE,
TELNET, LDAP, DICT. Do not assume any particular order. The protocols will
be listed using uppercase and are separated by newlines. There may be none,
one, or several protocols in the list. (Added in 7.13.0)
.IP "--static-libs"
Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options you will need in order
to link your application with libcurl statically. (Added in 7.17.1)
.IP "--version"
Outputs version information about the installed libcurl.
.IP "--vernum"
Outputs version information about the installed libcurl, in numerical mode.
This outputs the version number, in hexadecimal, with 8 bits for each part;
major, minor, patch. So that libcurl 7.7.4 would appear as 070704 and libcurl
12.13.14 would appear as 0c0d0e... Note that the initial zero might be
omitted. (This option was broken in the 7.15.0 release.)
.SH "EXAMPLES"
What linker options do I need when I link with libcurl?

  $ curl-config --libs

What compiler options do I need when I compile using libcurl functions?

  $ curl-config --cflags

How do I know if libcurl was built with SSL support?

  $ curl-config --feature | grep SSL

What's the installed libcurl version?

.TH curl 1 "30 Nov 2014" "Curl 7.40.0" "Curl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl \- transfer a URL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B curl [options]
.I [URL...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B curl
is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported
protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,
LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET
and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction.

curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user
authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer
resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
make your head spin!

curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
\fIlibcurl(3)\fP for details.
.SH URL
The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in
RFC 3986.

You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within
braces as in:

  http://site.{one,two,three}.com

or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

  ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt

  ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)

  ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each
other:

  http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html

You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched
in a sequential manner in the specified order.

You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or
letter:

  http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt

  http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt

When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you
probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from
interfering with it. This also goes for other characters treated special, like
for example '&', '?' and '*'.

Provide the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign and the
interface name. Like in

  http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/

If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what
protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other protocols
based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting
with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.

curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to
validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is instead
\fBvery\fP liberal with what it accepts.

curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that
getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects /
handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files
specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl
invokes.
.SH "PROGRESS METER"
curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating the
amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc.

curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke curl to
do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal, it
\fIdisables\fP the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
mixing progress meter and response data.

If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (>), -o [file] or
similar.

It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
any response data to the terminal.

If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, \fI-#\fP is your
friend.
.SH OPTIONS
Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an
additional value next to them.

The short "single-dash" form of the options, -d for example, may be used with
or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a recommended
separator. The long "double-dash" form, --data for example, requires a space
between it and its value.

Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used
immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all the
options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

In general, all boolean options are enabled with --\fBoption\fP and yet again
disabled with --\fBno-\fPoption. That is, you use the exact same option name
but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and show
the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was added in
7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled on/off on repeated use of the
same command line option.)
.IP "-#, --progress-bar"
Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard,
more informational, meter.
.IP "-:, --next"
Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and associated
options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each with their own
specific options, for example, such as different user names or custom requests
for each. (Added in 7.36.0)
.IP "-0, --http1.0"
(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its internally
preferred: HTTP 1.1.
.IP "--http1.1"
(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1. This is the internal default
version. (Added in 7.33.0)
.IP "--http2"
(HTTP) Tells curl to issue its requests using HTTP 2. This requires that the
underlying libcurl was built to support it. (Added in 7.33.0)
.IP "--no-npn"
Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built
with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is used by a libcurl that supports
HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.

(Added in 7.36.0)
.IP "--no-alpn"
Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built
with an SSL library that supports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports
HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.

(Added in 7.36.0)
.IP "-1, --tlsv1"
(SSL)
Forces curl to use TLS version 1.x when negotiating with a remote TLS server.
You can use options \fI--tlsv1.0\fP, \fI--tlsv1.1\fP, and \fI--tlsv1.2\fP to
control the TLS version more precisely (if the SSL backend in use supports such
a level of control).
.IP "-2, --sslv2"
(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a remote SSL
server. Sometimes curl is built without SSLv2 support. SSLv2 is widely
considered insecure.
.IP "-3, --sslv3"
(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with a remote SSL
server. Sometimes curl is built without SSLv3 support.
.IP "-4, --ipv4"
This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only, and not for
example try IPv6.
.IP "-6, --ipv6"
This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only, and not for
example try IPv4.
.IP "-a, --append"
(FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the target file
instead of overwriting it. If the remote file doesn't exist, it will be
created.  Note that this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including
OpenSSH).
.IP "-A, --user-agent <agent string>"
(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly
done CGIs fail if this field isn't set to "Mozilla/4.0". To encode blanks in
the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This can also be set
with the \fI-H, --header\fP option of course.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--anyauth"
(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the
most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by first
doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an
extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific
authentication method, which you can do with \fI--basic\fP, \fI--digest\fP,
\fI--ntlm\fP, and \fI--negotiate\fP.

Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
since it may require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to
rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
operation will fail.
.IP "-b, --cookie <name=data>"
(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data
previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.  The data should
be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

If no '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to
read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this session
if they match. Using this method also activates the "cookie parser" which will
make curl record incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this
in combination with the \fI-L, --location\fP option. The file format of the
file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla
cookie file format.

The file specified with \fI-b, --cookie\fP is only used as input. No cookies
will be written to the file. To store cookies, use the \fI-c, --cookie-jar\fP
option.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-B, --use-ascii"
(FTP/LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using
an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be
in text mode for win32 systems.
.IP "--basic"
(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host. This
is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to
override a previously set option that sets a different authentication method
(such as \fI--ntlm\fP, \fI--digest\fP, or \fI--negotiate\fP).

Used together with \fI-u, --user\fP and \fI-x, --proxy\fP.

See also \fI--proxy-basic\fP.
.IP "-c, --cookie-jar <file name>"
(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified
file as well as all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are
known, no data will be written. The file will be written using the Netscape
cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the
cookies will be written to stdout.

This command line option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl
record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the \fI-b,
--cookie\fP option.

If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation
won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a warning
displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly
lethal situation.

If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be
used.
.IP "-C, --continue-at <offset>"
Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset
is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting from the beginning
of the source file before it is transferred to the destination.  If used with
uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the
transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that out.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--ciphers <list of ciphers>"
(SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers
must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL:
\fIhttps://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html\fP

NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The full list of NSS
ciphers is in the NSSCipherSuite entry at this URL:
\fIhttps://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/mod_nss.git/plain/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives\fP

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--compressed"
(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl
supports, and save the uncompressed document.  If this option is used and the
server sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.
.IP "--connect-timeout <seconds>"
Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to take.  This only
limits the connection phase, so if curl connects within the given period it
will continue - if not it will exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option
accepts decimal values.

See also the \fI-m, --max-time\fP option.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--create-dirs"
When used in conjunction with the \fI-o\fP option, curl will create the
necessary local directory hierarchy as needed. This option creates the dirs
mentioned with the \fI-o\fP option, nothing else. If the \fI-o\fP file name
uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will be created.

To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try
\fI--ftp-create-dirs\fP.
.IP "--crlf"
Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).

(SMTP added in 7.40.0)
.IP "--crlfile <file>"
(HTTPS/FTPS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revocation
List that may specify peer certificates that are to be considered revoked.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

(Added in 7.19.7)
.IP "-d, --data <data>"
(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the
same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and
presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server
using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to
\fI-F, --form\fP.

\fI-d, --data\fP is the same as \fI--data-ascii\fP. \fI--data-raw\fP is almost
the same but does not have a special interpretation of the @ character. To
post data purely binary, you should instead use the \fI--data-binary\fP option.
To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use \fI--data-urlencode\fP.

If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line, the
data pieces specified will be merged together with a separating
&-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post
chunk that looks like \&'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to
read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data from
stdin. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a file
named 'foobar' would thus be done with \fI--data\fP @foobar. When --data is
told to read from a file like that, carriage returns and newlines will be
stripped out. If you don't want the @ character to have a special
interpretation use \fI--data-raw\fP instead.
.IP "-D, --dump-header <file>"
Write the protocol headers to the specified file.

This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that an HTTP
site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second
curl invocation by using the \fI-b, --cookie\fP option! The
\fI-c, --cookie-jar\fP option is a better way to store cookies.

When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered being "headers"
and thus are saved there.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--data-ascii <data>"
See \fI-d, --data\fP.
.IP "--data-binary <data>"
(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing
whatsoever.

If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename.  Data
is posted in a similar manner as \fI--data-ascii\fP does, except that newlines
and carriage returns are preserved and conversions are never done.

If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append
data as described in \fI-d, --data\fP.
.IP "--data-raw <data>"
(HTTP) This posts data similarly to \fI--data\fP but without the special
interpretation of the @ character. See \fI-d, --data\fP.
(Added in 7.43.0)
.IP "--data-urlencode <data>"
(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other --data options with the exception
that this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)

To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin with a \fIname\fP followed
by a separator and a content specification. The <data> part can be passed to
curl using one of the following syntaxes:
.RS
.IP "content"
This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful
so that the content doesn't contain any = or @ symbols, as that will then make
the syntax match one of the other cases below!
.IP "=content"
This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding =
symbol is not included in the data.
.IP "name=content"
This will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note that
the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.
.IP "@filename"
This will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines),
URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST.
.IP "name@filename"
This will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines),
URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal
sign appended, resulting in \fIname=urlencoded-file-content\fP. Note that the
name is expected to be URL-encoded already.
.RE
.IP "--delegation LEVEL"
Set \fILEVEL\fP to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate when it
comes to user credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos.
.RS
.IP "none"
Don't allow any delegation.
.IP "policy"
Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in the Kerberos
service ticket, which is a matter of realm policy.
.IP "always"
Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.
.RE
.IP "--digest"
(HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authentication scheme
that prevents the password from being sent over the wire in clear text. Use
this in combination with the normal \fI-u, --user\fP option to set user name
and password. See also \fI--ntlm\fP, \fI--negotiate\fP and \fI--anyauth\fP for
related options.

If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.
.IP "--disable-eprt"
(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing
active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPRT,
then LPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT right
away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP protocol, and may not
work on all servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
the traditional PORT command.

\fB--eprt\fP can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and \fB--no-eprt\fP
is an alias for \fB--disable-eprt\fP.

Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch to
passive mode you need to not use \fI-P, --ftp-port\fP or force it with
\fI--ftp-pasv\fP.
.IP "--disable-epsv"
(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when doing passive FTP
transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV,
but with this option, it will not try using EPSV.

\fB--epsv\fP can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and \fB--no-epsv\fP
is an alias for \fB--disable-epsv\fP.

Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to switch to
active mode you need to use \fI-P, --ftp-port\fP.
.IP "--dns-interface <interface>"
Tell curl to send outgoing DNS requests through <interface>. This option
is a counterpart to \fI--interface\fP (which does not affect DNS). The
supplied string must be an interface name (not an address).

This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one. (Added in
7.33.0)
.IP "--dns-ipv4-addr <ip-address>"
Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv4 DNS requests, so that
the DNS requests originate from this address. The argument should be a
single IPv4 address.

This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.  (Added in
7.33.0)
.IP "--dns-ipv6-addr <ip-address>"
Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv6 DNS requests, so that
the DNS requests originate from this address. The argument should be a
single IPv6 address.

This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.  (Added in
7.33.0)
.IP "--dns-servers <ip-address,ip-address>"
Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system default.
The list of IP addresses should be separated with commas. Port numbers
may also optionally be given as \fI:<port-number>\fP after each IP
address.

This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.  (Added in
7.33.0)
.IP "-e, --referer <URL>"
(HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also
be set with the \fI-H, --header\fP flag of course.  When used with
\fI-L, --location\fP you can append ";auto" to the --referer URL to make curl
automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The
\&";auto" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial --referer.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-E, --cert <certificate[:password]>"
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting a
file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be
in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using any other
engine.  If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried
for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a \&"certificate" file that
is the private key and the private certificate concatenated! See \fI--cert\fP
and \fI--key\fP to specify them independently.

If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option can tell
curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the NSS database defined
by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the
NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be
loaded. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please precede
it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.  If the
nickname contains ":", it needs to be preceded by "\\" so that it is not
recognized as password delimiter.  If the nickname contains "\\", it needs to
be escaped as "\\\\" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.

(iOS and Mac OS X only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then the
certificate string can either be the name of a certificate/private key in the
system or user keychain, or the path to a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and
private key. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please
precede it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--engine <name>"
Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher
operations. Use \fI--engine list\fP to print a list of build-time supported
engines. Note that not all (or none) of the engines may be available at
run-time.
.IP "--environment"
(RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using the names the
\fI-w\fP option supports, to allow easier extraction of useful information
after having run curl.
.IP "--egd-file <file>"
(SSL) Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket
is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the
\fI--random-file\fP option.
.IP "--cert-type <type>"
(SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM,
DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified, PEM is assumed.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--cacert <CA certificate>"
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The
file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM
format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this option
is typically used to alter that default file.

curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is
set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option
overrides that variable.

The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named
\'curl-ca-bundle.crt\', either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the
Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.

If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module
(libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--capath <CA certificate directory>"
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the
peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with ":" (e.g.
\&"path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is
built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed using the
c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using \fI--capath\fP can allow
OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more efficiently than using
\fI--cacert\fP if the \fI--cacert\fP file contains many CA certificates.

If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored, and if it is
used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--pinnedpubkey <pinned public key>"
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified public key file to verify the peer. The
file must contain a single public key in PEM or DER format.

When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate
indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and
if it does not exactly match the public key provided to this option, curl will
abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.

Added in 7.39.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit. Added in 7.43.0 for NSS and
wolfSSL/CyaSSL. Other SSL backends not supported.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--cert-status"
(SSL) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using the
Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.

If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g. expired)
response, if the response suggests that the server certificate has been revoked,
or no response at all is received, the verification fails.

This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS backends.
(Added in 7.41.0)
.IP "--false-start"

(SSL) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS handshake. False start is a
mode where a TLS client will start sending application data before verifying
the server's Finished message, thus saving a round trip when performing a full
handshake.

This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure Transport (on iOS 7.0
or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.
(Added in 7.42.0)
.IP "-f, --fail"
(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done
to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal
cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML
document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will
prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful
response codes will slip through, especially when authentication is involved
(response codes 401 and 407).
.IP "-F, --form <name=content>"
(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the
submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type
multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary
files etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with
an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get
attached in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just
get the contents for that text field from a file.

Example, to send your password file to the server, where
\&'password' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the
input:

\fBcurl\fP -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes
for both @ and < constructs.

You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner
similar to:

\fBcurl\fP -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com

or

\fBcurl\fP -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com

You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by setting
filename=, like this:

\fBcurl\fP -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com

If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by double-quotes like:

\fBcurl\fP -F "file=@\\"localfile\\";filename=\\"nameinpost\\"" url.com

or

\fBcurl\fP -F 'file=@"localfile";filename="nameinpost"' url.com

Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any double-quote
or backslash within the filename must be escaped by backslash.

See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

This option can be used multiple times.
.IP "--ftp-account [data]"
(FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name and password
has been provided, this data is sent off using the ACCT command. (Added in
7.13.0)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--ftp-alternative-to-user <command>"
(FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send this
command.  When connecting to Tumbleweed's Secure Transport server over FTPS
using a client certificate, using "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve
the username from the certificate. (Added in 7.15.5)
.IP "--ftp-create-dirs"
(FTP/SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that doesn't
currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of curl is to
fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to create missing
directories.
.IP "--ftp-method [method]"
(FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on an FTP(S)
server. The method argument should be one of the following alternatives:
.RS
.IP multicwd
curl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep
hierarchies this means very many commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should
be done. This is the default but the slowest behavior.
.IP nocwd
curl does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full
path to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.
.IP singlecwd
curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the file
\&"normally" (like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards
compliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.
.RE
.IP
(Added in 7.15.1)
.IP "--ftp-pasv"
(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the internal default
behavior, but using this option can be used to override a previous
\fI-P/-ftp-port\fP option. (Added in 7.11.0)

If this option is used several times, only the first one is used. Undoing an
enforced passive really isn't doable but you must then instead enforce the
correct \fI-P, --ftp-port\fP again.

Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and then PASV,
unless \fI--disable-epsv\fP is used.
.IP "--ftp-skip-pasv-ip"
(FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in its response
to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data connection. Instead curl
will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the control
connection. (Added in 7.14.2)

This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.
.IP "--ftp-pret"
(FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV). Certain
FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this non-standard command for
directory listings as well as up and downloads in PASV mode.
(Added in 7.20.x)
.IP "--ftp-ssl-ccc"
(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel)
Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest of the
control channel communication will be unencrypted. This allows
NAT routers to follow the FTP transaction. The default mode is
passive. See \fI--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode\fP for other modes.
(Added in 7.16.1)
.IP "--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode [active/passive]"
(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel)
Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the shutdown, but
instead wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to the
shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and
waits for a reply from the server.
(Added in 7.16.2)
.IP "--ftp-ssl-control"
(FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for transfer.  Allows secure
authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers for efficiency.  Fails the
transfer if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.  (Added in 7.16.0)
that can still be used but will be removed in a future version.
.IP "--form-string <name=string>"
(HTTP) Similar to \fI--form\fP except that the value string for the named
parameter is used literally. Leading \&'@' and \&'<' characters, and the
\&';type=' string in the value have no special meaning. Use this in preference
to \fI--form\fP if there's any possibility that the string value may
accidentally trigger the \&'@' or \&'<' features of \fI--form\fP.
.IP "-g, --globoff"
This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option,
you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being
interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal URL
contents but they should be encoded according to the URI standard.
.IP "-G, --get"
When used, this option will make all data specified with \fI-d, --data\fP,
\fI--data-binary\fP or \fI--data-urlencode\fP to be used in an HTTP GET
request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used. The data
will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.

If used in combination with -I, the POST data will instead be appended to the
URL with a HEAD request.

If this option is used several times, only the first one is used. This is
because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but you should then instead enforce
the alternative method you prefer.
.IP "-H, --header <header>"
(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a
server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should
add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl
would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal
one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally
do. You should not replace internally set headers without knowing perfectly
well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement
without content on the right side of the colon, as in: -H \&"Host:". If you
send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a
semicolon, such as \-H \&"X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".

curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper
end-of-line marker, you should thus \fBnot\fP add that as a part of the header
content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up
for you.

See also the \fI-A, --user-agent\fP and \fI-e, --referer\fP options.

Starting in 7.37.0, you need \fI--proxy-header\fP to send custom headers
intended for a proxy.

Example:

\&# curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" http://192.168.0.1/

\fBWARNING\fP: headers set with this option will be set in all requests - even
after redirects are followed, like when told with \fB-L, --location\fP. This
can lead to the header being sent to other hosts than the original host, so
sensitive headers should be used with caution combined with following
redirects.

This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.
.IP "--hostpubmd5 <md5>"
(SCP/SFTP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The string should
be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's public key, curl will refuse
the connection with the host unless the md5sums match. (Added in 7.17.1)
.IP "--ignore-content-length"
(HTTP)
Ignore the Content-Length header. This is particularly useful for servers
running Apache 1.x, which will report incorrect Content-Length for files
larger than 2 gigabytes.
.IP "-i, --include"
(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things
like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...
.IP "-I, --head"
(HTTP/FTP/FILE)
Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD
which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used
on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification
time only.
.IP "--interface <name>"
Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface
name, IP address or host name. An example could look like:

 curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-j, --junk-session-cookies"
(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will
make it discard all "session cookies". This will basically have the same effect
as if a new session is started. Typical browsers always discard session
cookies when they're closed down.
.IP "-J, --remote-header-name"
(HTTP) This option tells the \fI-O, --remote-name\fP option to use the
server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename
from the URL.

There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so
this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names.
.IP "-k, --insecure"
(SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections
and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using
the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections
considered "insecure" fail unless \fI-k, --insecure\fP is used.

See this online resource for further details:
\fBhttp://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\fP
.IP "-K, --config <config file>"
Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a
text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be
used as if they were written on the actual command line.

Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line,
separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option names can
optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes and
if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as separators. If the option
is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals character
between the option and its parameter.

If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be enclosed
within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are
available: \\\\, \\", \\t, \\n, \\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other
letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is a '#' character,
the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per
physical line in the config file.

Specify the filename to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read the file from
stdin.

Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify
it using the \fI--url\fP option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own
line. So, it could look similar to this:

url = "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/"

When curl is invoked, it always (unless \fI-q\fP is used) checks for a default
config file and uses it if found. The default config file is checked for in
the following places in this order:

1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and
then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on
Unix-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your
system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last
resort the '%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data'.

2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one
in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On Unix-like systems, it will
simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.

.nf
# --- Example file ---
# this is a comment
url = "curl.haxx.se"
output = "curlhere.html"
user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

# and fetch another URL too
url = "curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"
-O
referer = "http://nowhereatall.com/"
# --- End of example file ---
.fi

This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.
.IP "--keepalive-time <seconds>"
This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle before sending
keepalive probes and the time between individual keepalive probes. It is
currently effective on operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and
TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This
option has no effect if \fI--no-keepalive\fP is used. (Added in 7.18.0)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. If
unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.
.IP "--key <key>"
(SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this
separate file. For SSH, if not specified, curl tries the following candidates
in order: '~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--key-type <type>"
(SSL) Private key file type. Specify which type your \fI--key\fP provided
private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is
assumed.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--krb <level>"
(FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be entered and
should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or 'private'. Should you use
a level that is not one of these, 'private' will instead be used.

This option requires a library built with kerberos4 support. This is not
very common. Use \fI-V, --version\fP to see if your curl supports it.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-l, --list-only"
(FTP)
When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view. This is
especially useful if the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP
directory since the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or
format. When used like this, the option causes a NLST command to be sent to
the server instead of LIST.

Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not
include sub-directories and symbolic links.

(POP3)
When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST command
to be performed instead of RETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants
to see if a specific message id exists on the server and what size it is.

Note: When combined with \fI-X, --request <command>\fP, this option can be used
to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's unique
identifier rather than it's message id to make the request. (Added in 7.21.5)
.IP "-L, --location"
(HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a
different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code),
this option will make curl redo the request on the new place. If used together
with \fI-i, --include\fP or \fI-I, --head\fP, headers from all requested pages
will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to
the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't be
able to intercept the user+password. See also \fI--location-trusted\fP on how
to change this. You can limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the
\fI--max-redirs\fP option.

When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example
POST or PUT), it will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP response
was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code, curl will
re-send the following request using the same unmodified method.

You can tell curl to not change the non-GET request method to GET after a 30x
response by using the dedicated options for that: \fI--post301\fP,
\fI--post302\fP and \fI-post303\fP.
.IP "--libcurl <file>"
Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you will get a
libcurl-using C source code written to the file that does the equivalent
of what your command-line operation does!

If this option is used several times, the last given file name will be
used. (Added in 7.16.1)
.IP "--limit-rate <speed>"
Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use - for both downloads
and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you'd like
your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it
otherwise would be.

The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended.
Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it
megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

The given rate is the average speed counted during the entire transfer. It
means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts, but over
time it uses no more than the given rate.

If you also use the \fI-Y, --speed-limit\fP option, that option will take
precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the
speed-limit logic working.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--local-port <num>[-num]"
Set a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use for the
connection(s).  Note that port numbers by nature are a scarce resource that
will be busy at times so setting this range to something too narrow might
cause unnecessary connection setup failures. (Added in 7.15.2)
.IP "--location-trusted"
(HTTP/HTTPS) Like \fI-L, --location\fP, but will allow sending the name +
password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not
introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to a site to which
you'll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP
Basic authentication).
.IP "-m, --max-time <seconds>"
Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation to take.  This is
useful for preventing your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow
networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal
values, but the actual timeout will decrease in accuracy as the specified
timeout increases in decimal precision.  See also the \fI--connect-timeout\fP
option.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--login-options <options>"
Specify the login options to use during server authentication.

You can use the login options to specify protocol specific options that may
be used during authentication. At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support
login options. For more information about the login options please see
RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and IETF draft draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt (Added in
7.34.0).

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--mail-auth <address>"
(SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be used to specify the
authentication address (identity) of a submitted message that is being relayed
to another server.

(Added in 7.25.0)
.IP "--mail-from <address>"
(SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should get sent from.

(Added in 7.20.0)
.IP "--max-filesize <bytes>"
Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file
requested is larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl will
return with exit code 63.

\fBNOTE:\fP The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such
files this option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger
than this given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.
.IP "--mail-rcpt <address>"
(SMTP) Specify a single address, user name or mailing list name.

When performing a mail transfer, the recipient should specify a valid email
address to send the mail to. (Added in 7.20.0)

When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the recipient should be
specified as the user name or user name and domain (as per Section 3.5 of
RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recipient should be
specified using the mailing list name, such as "Friends" or "London-Office".
(Added in 7.34.0)
.IP "--max-redirs <num>"
Set maximum number of redirection-followings allowed. If \fI-L, --location\fP
is used, this option can be used to prevent curl from following redirections
\&"in absurdum". By default, the limit is set to 50 redirections. Set this
option to -1 to make it limitless.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--metalink"
This option can tell curl to parse and process a given URI as Metalink file
(both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are supported) and make use of the mirrors
listed within for failover if there are errors (such as the file or server not
being available). It will also verify the hash of the file after the download
completes. The Metalink file itself is downloaded and processed in memory and
not stored in the local file system.

Example to use a remote Metalink file:

\fBcurl\fP --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink

To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE protocol
(file://):

\fBcurl\fP --metalink file://example.metalink

Please note that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is no way to use
a local Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also note that if
\fI--metalink\fP and \fI--include\fP are used together, \fI--include\fP will be
ignored. This is because including headers in the response will break
Metalink parser and if the headers are included in the file described
in Metalink file, hash check will fail.

(Added in 7.27.0, if built against the libmetalink library.)
.IP "-n, --netrc"
Makes curl scan the \fI.netrc\fP (\fI_netrc\fP on Windows) file in the user's
home directory for login name and password. This is typically used for FTP on
Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable user authentication. See
\fIftp(1)\fP for details on the file format. Curl will not
complain if that file doesn't have the right permissions (it should not be
either world- or group-readable). The environment variable "HOME" is used to
find the home directory.

A quick and very simple example of how to setup a \fI.netrc\fP to allow curl
to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name \&'myself' and password
\&'secret' should look similar to:

.B "machine host.domain.com login myself password secret"
.IP "-N, --no-buffer"
Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations, curl
will use a standard buffered output stream that will have the effect that it
will output the data in chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data arrives.
Using this option will disable that buffering.

Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use
\fI--buffer\fP to enforce the buffering.
.IP "--netrc-file"
This option is similar to \fI--netrc\fP, except that you provide the path
(absolute or relative) to the netrc file that Curl should use.
You can only specify one netrc file per invocation. If several
\fI--netrc-file\fP options are provided, only the \fBlast one\fP will be used.
(Added in 7.21.5)

This option overrides any use of \fI--netrc\fP as they are mutually exclusive.
It will also abide by \fI--netrc-optional\fP if specified.

.IP "--netrc-optional"
Very similar to \fI--netrc\fP, but this option makes the .netrc usage
\fBoptional\fP and not mandatory as the \fI--netrc\fP option does.

.IP "--negotiate"
(HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

If you want to enable Negotiate (SPNEGO) for proxy authentication, then use
\fI--proxy-negotiate\fP.

This option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI support. Use \fI-V,
--version\fP to see if your curl supports GSS-API/SSPI and SPNEGO.

When using this option, you must also provide a fake \fI-u, --user\fP option to
activate the authentication code properly. Sending a '-u :' is enough as the
user name and password from the \fI-u\fP option aren't actually used.

If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.
.IP "--no-keepalive"
Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP connection, as by default
curl enables them.

Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use
\fI--keepalive\fP to enforce keepalive.
.IP "--no-sessionid"
(SSL) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By default all transfers
are done using the cache. Note that while nothing should ever get hurt by
attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL
implementations in the wild that may require you to disable this in order for
you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)

Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use
\fI--sessionid\fP to enforce session-ID caching.
.IP "--noproxy <no-proxy-list>"
Comma-separated list of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one is specified.
The only wildcard is a single * character, which matches all hosts, and
effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either
a domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself. For example,
local.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not
www.notlocal.com.  (Added in 7.19.4).
.IP "--ntlm"
(HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was
designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary
protocol, reverse-engineered by clever people and implemented in curl based
on their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed, you should
encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a public and documented
authentication method instead, such as Digest.

If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use
\fI--proxy-ntlm\fP.

This option requires a library built with SSL support. Use
\fI-V, --version\fP to see if your curl supports NTLM.

If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.
.IP "-o, --output <file>"
Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the <file>
specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL
being fetched. Like in:

  curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

or use several variables like:

  curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.

See also the \fI--create-dirs\fP option to create the local directories
dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will force the
output to be done to stdout.
.IP "-O, --remote-name"
Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file
part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)

The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL,
nothing else.

Consequentially, the file will be saved in the current working directory. If
you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change current
working directory before you invoke curl with the \fB-O, --remote-name\fP flag!

There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or other URL
encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as file name.

You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.
.IP "--oauth2-bearer"
(IMAP, POP3, SMTP)
Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH 2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token
is used in conjunction with the user name which can be specified as part of the
\fI--url\fP or \fI-u, --user\fP options.

The Bearer Token and user name are formatted according to RFC 6750.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--proxy-header <header>"
(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a
proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is the equivalent
option to \fI-H, --header\fP but is for proxy communication only like in
CONNECT requests when you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what is
sent to the actual remote host.

curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper
end-of-line marker, you should thus \fBnot\fP add that as a part of the header
content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things
up for you.

Headers specified with this option will not be included in requests that curl
knows will not be sent to a proxy.

This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.

(Added in 7.37.0)
.IP "-p, --proxytunnel"
When an HTTP proxy is used (\fI-x, --proxy\fP), this option will cause non-HTTP
protocols to attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to
do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy
CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the
remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.
.IP "-P, --ftp-port <address>"
(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with
FTP. This switch makes curl use active mode. In practice, curl then tells the
server to connect back to the client's specified address and port, while
passive mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect
to. <address> should be one of:
.RS
.IP interface
i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you want to use (Unix only)
.IP "IP address"
i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address
.IP "host name"
i.e "my.host.domain" to specify the machine
.IP "-"
make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the control
connection
.RE
.IP
If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. Disable the
use of PORT with \fI--ftp-pasv\fP. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT command
instead of PORT by using \fI--disable-eprt\fP. EPRT is really PORT++.

Starting in 7.19.5, you can append \&":[start]-[end]\&" to the right of the
address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you specify a
port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,
but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the port may not be
available.
.IP "--pass <phrase>"
(SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the private key

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--path-as-is"
Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the given URL
path. Normally curl will squash or merge them according to standards but with
this option set you tell it not to do that.

(Added in 7.42.0)
.IP "--post301"
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests
into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is
ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such
a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using \fI-L, --location\fP
(Added in 7.17.1)
.IP "--post302"
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests
into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is
ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such
a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using \fI-L, --location\fP
(Added in 7.19.1)
.IP "--post303"
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests
into GET requests when following a 303 redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is
ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such
a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using \fI-L, --location\fP
(Added in 7.26.0)
.IP "--proto <protocols>"
Tells curl to use the listed protocols for its initial retrieval. Protocols
are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and are each a protocol
name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available
modifiers are:
.RS
.TP 3
.B +
Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted (this is
the default if no modifier is used).
.TP
.B -
Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already permitted.
.TP
.B =
Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already permitted), though
subject to later modification by subsequent entries in the comma separated
list.
.RE
.IP
For example:
.RS
.TP 15
.B --proto -ftps
uses the default protocols, but disables ftps
.TP
.B  --proto -all,https,+http
only enables http and https
.TP
.B --proto =http,https
also only enables http and https
.RE
.IP
Unknown protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to safely rely on
being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without relying upon
support for that protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.

This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the same
as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the option.

(Added in 7.20.2)
.IP "--proto-redir <protocols>"
Tells curl to use the listed protocols after a redirect. See --proto for
how protocols are represented.

(Added in 7.20.2)
.IP "--proxy-anyauth"
Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when communicating with
the given proxy. This might cause an extra request/response round-trip. (Added
in 7.13.2)
.IP "--proxy-basic"
Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating with the given
proxy. Use \fI--basic\fP for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is
the default authentication method curl uses with proxies.
.IP "--proxy-digest"
Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating with the given
proxy. Use \fI--digest\fP for enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.
.IP "--proxy-negotiate"
Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when communicating
with the given proxy. Use \fI--negotiate\fP for enabling HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO)
with a remote host. (Added in 7.17.1)
.IP "--proxy-ntlm"
Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating with the given
proxy. Use \fI--ntlm\fP for enabling NTLM with a remote host.
.IP "--proxy-service-name <servicename>"
This option allows you to change the service name for proxy negotiation.

Examples: --proxy-negotiate proxy-name \fI--proxy-service-name\fP sockd would use
sockd/proxy-name.  (Added in 7.43.0).
.IP "--proxy1.0 <proxyhost[:port]>"
Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is
assumed at port 1080.

The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option (\fI-x, --proxy\fP),
is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will specify an HTTP 1.0
protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.
.IP "--pubkey <key>"
(SSH) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your public key in this
separate file.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

(As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public key from the
private key file, so passing this option is generally not required. Note that
this public key extraction requires libcurl to be linked against a copy of
libssh2 1.2.8 or higher that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)
.IP "-q"
If used as the first parameter on the command line, the \fIcurlrc\fP config
file will not be read and used. See the \fI-K, --config\fP for details on the
default config file search path.
.IP "-Q, --quote <command>"
(FTP/SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote
commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place (just after the initial PWD
command in an FTP transfer, to be exact). To make commands take place after a
successful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'.  To make commands be sent
after curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer
command(s), prefix the command with a '+' (this is only supported for
FTP). You may specify any number of commands. If the server returns failure
for one of the commands, the entire operation will be aborted. You must send
syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one
of the commands listed below to SFTP servers.  This option can be used
multiple times. When speaking to an FTP server, prefix the command with an
asterisk (*) to make curl continue even if the command fails as by default
curl will stop at first failure.

SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote commands
itself before sending them to the server.  File names may be quoted
shell-style to embed spaces or special characters.  Following is the list of
all supported SFTP quote commands:
.RS
.IP "chgrp group file"
The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by the file operand to
the group ID specified by the group operand. The group operand is a decimal
integer group ID.
.IP "chmod mode file"
The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the specified file. The
mode operand is an octal integer mode number.
.IP "chown user file"
The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the file operand to the
user ID specified by the user operand. The user operand is a decimal
integer user ID.
.IP "ln source_file target_file"
The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the target_file location
pointing to the source_file location.
.IP "mkdir directory_name"
The mkdir command creates the directory named by the directory_name operand.
.IP "pwd"
The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
.IP "rename source target"
The rename command renames the file or directory named by the source
operand to the destination path named by the target operand.
.IP "rm file"
The rm command removes the file specified by the file operand.
.IP "rmdir directory"
The rmdir command removes the directory entry specified by the directory
operand, provided it is empty.
.IP "symlink source_file target_file"
See ln.
.RE
.IP "-r, --range <range>"
(HTTP/FTP/SFTP/FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial document) from a
HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP server or a local FILE. Ranges can be specified
in a number of ways.
.RS
.TP 10
.B 0-499
specifies the first 500 bytes
.TP
.B 500-999
specifies the second 500 bytes
.TP
.B -500
specifies the last 500 bytes
.TP
.B 9500-
specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward
.TP
.B 0-0,-1
specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)
.TP
.B 500-700,600-799
specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)
.TP
.B 100-199,500-599
specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*)(H)
.RE
.IP
(*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a multipart
response!

Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and 'stop' fields of the
\&'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit character is given in the range,
the server's response will be unspecified, depending on the server's
configuration.

You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature
enabled, so that when you attempt to get a range, you'll instead get the whole
document.

FTP and SFTP range downloads only support the simple 'start-stop' syntax
(optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP use depends on the extended
FTP command SIZE.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-R, --remote-time"
When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the
remote file, and if that is available make the local file get that same
timestamp.
.IP "--random-file <file>"
(SSL) Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered as
random data. The data is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections.
See also the \fI--egd-file\fP option.
.IP "--raw"
(HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of content or transfer
encodings and instead makes them passed on unaltered, raw. (Added in 7.16.2)
.IP "--remote-name-all"
This option changes the default action for all given URLs to be dealt with as
if \fI-O, --remote-name\fP were used for each one. So if you want to disable
that for a specific URL after \fI--remote-name-all\fP has been used, you must
use "-o -" or \fI--no-remote-name\fP. (Added in 7.19.0)
.IP "--resolve <host:port:address>"
Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Using this, you
can make the curl requests(s) use a specified address and prevent the
otherwise normally resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
/etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number should be
the number used for the specific protocol the host will be used for. It means
you need several entries if you want to provide address for the same host but
different ports.

This option can be used many times to add many host names to resolve.

(Added in 7.21.3)
.IP "--retry <num>"
If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it
will retry this number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0
makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient error means either:
a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 5xx response code.

When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then
for all forthcoming retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches
10 minutes which then will be the delay between the rest of the retries.  By
using \fI--retry-delay\fP you disable this exponential backoff algorithm. See
also \fI--retry-max-time\fP to limit the total time allowed for
retries. (Added in 7.12.3)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--retry-delay <seconds>"
Make curl sleep this amount of time before each retry when a transfer has
failed with a transient error (it changes the default backoff time algorithm
between retries). This option is only interesting if \fI--retry\fP is also
used. Setting this delay to zero will make curl use the default backoff time.
(Added in 7.12.3)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--retry-max-time <seconds>"
The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will be
done as usual (see \fI--retry\fP) as long as the timer hasn't reached this
given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't reached the limit, the request
will be made and while performing, it may take longer than this given time
period. To limit a single request\'s maximum time, use \fI-m, --max-time\fP.
Set this option to zero to not timeout retries. (Added in 7.12.3)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-s, --silent"
Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.  Makes Curl
mute. It will still output the data you ask for, potentially even to the
terminal/stdout unless you redirect it.
.IP "--sasl-ir"
Enable initial response in SASL authentication.
(Added in 7.31.0)
.IP "--service-name <servicename>"
This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

Examples: --negotiate \fI--service-name\fP sockd would use
sockd/server-name.  (Added in 7.43.0).
.IP "-S, --show-error"
When used with \fI-s\fP it makes curl show an error message if it fails.
.IP "--ssl"
(FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection.  Reverts to a
non-secure connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.  See also
\fI--ftp-ssl-control\fP and \fI--ssl-reqd\fP for different levels of
encryption required. (Added in 7.20.0)

This option was formerly known as \fI--ftp-ssl\fP (Added in 7.11.0). That
option name can still be used but will be removed in a future version.
.IP "--ssl-reqd"
(FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.  Terminates the
connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.20.0)

This option was formerly known as \fI--ftp-ssl-reqd\fP (added in 7.15.5). That
option name can still be used but will be removed in a future version.
.IP "--ssl-allow-beast"
(SSL) This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the SSL3
and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option isn't used, the SSL layer
may use workarounds known to cause interoperability problems with some older
SSL implementations. WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by
using this flag you ask for exactly that.  (Added in 7.25.0)
.IP "--socks4 <host[:port]>"
Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is
assumed at port 1080. (Added in 7.15.2)

This option overrides any previous use of \fI-x, --proxy\fP, as they are
mutually exclusive.

Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4 proxy
with \fI-x, --proxy\fP using a socks4:// protocol prefix.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--socks4a <host[:port]>"
Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is
assumed at port 1080. (Added in 7.18.0)

This option overrides any previous use of \fI-x, --proxy\fP, as they are
mutually exclusive.

Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4a proxy
with \fI-x, --proxy\fP using a socks4a:// protocol prefix.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--socks5-hostname <host[:port]>"
Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the proxy resolve the host name). If
the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080. (Added in
7.18.0)

This option overrides any previous use of \fI-x, --proxy\fP, as they are
mutually exclusive.

Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5
hostname proxy with \fI-x, --proxy\fP using a socks5h:// protocol prefix.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. (This option
was previously wrongly documented and used as --socks without the number
appended.)
.IP "--socks5 <host[:port]>"
Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name locally. If the
port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

This option overrides any previous use of \fI-x, --proxy\fP, as they are
mutually exclusive.

Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 proxy
with \fI-x, --proxy\fP using a socks5:// protocol prefix.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. (This option
was previously wrongly documented and used as --socks without the number
appended.)

This option (as well as \fI--socks4\fP) does not work with IPV6, FTPS or LDAP.
.IP "--socks5-gssapi-service <servicename>"
The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This option
allows you to change it.

Examples: --socks5 proxy-name \fI--socks5-gssapi-service\fP sockd would use
sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name \fI--socks5-gssapi-service\fP
sockd/real-name would use sockd/real-name for cases where the proxy-name does
not match the principal name.  (Added in 7.19.4).
.IP "--socks5-gssapi-nec"
As part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is negotiated. RFC 1961
says in section 4.3/4.4 it should be protected, but the NEC reference
implementation does not.  The option \fI--socks5-gssapi-nec\fP allows the
unprotected exchange of the protection mode negotiation. (Added in 7.19.4).
.IP "--stderr <file>"
Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name
is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-t, --telnet-option <OPT=val>"
Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.
.IP "-T, --upload-file <file>"
This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file
part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you
must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove to Curl that there
is no file name or curl will think that your last directory name is the remote
file name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to fail. If
this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will be used.

Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file.
Alternately, the file name "." (a single period) may be specified instead
of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking mode to allow reading server output
while stdin is being uploaded.

You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T + URL pair
specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T
argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by using
the same URL globbing style supported in the URL, like this:

curl -T "{file1,file2}" http://www.uploadtothissite.com

or even

curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/
.IP "--tcp-nodelay"
Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP man page for
details about this option. (Added in 7.11.2)
.IP "--tftp-blksize <value>"
(TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block size that
curl will try to use when transferring data to or from a TFTP server. By
default 512 bytes will be used.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

(Added in 7.20.0)
.IP "--tlsauthtype <authtype>"
Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only supported option is "SRP",
for TLS-SRP (RFC 5054). If \fI--tlsuser\fP and \fI--tlspassword\fP are
specified but \fI--tlsauthtype\fP is not, then this option defaults to "SRP".
(Added in 7.21.4)
.IP "--tlspassword <password>"
Set password for use with the TLS authentication method specified with
\fI--tlsauthtype\fP. Requires that \fI--tlsuser\fP also be set.  (Added in
7.21.4)
.IP "--tlsuser <user>"
Set username for use with the TLS authentication method specified with
\fI--tlsauthtype\fP. Requires that \fI--tlspassword\fP also be set.  (Added in
7.21.4)
.IP "--tlsv1.0"
(SSL)
Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 when negotiating with a remote TLS server.
(Added in 7.34.0)
.IP "--tlsv1.1"
(SSL)
Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 when negotiating with a remote TLS server.
(Added in 7.34.0)
.IP "--tlsv1.2"
(SSL)
Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 when negotiating with a remote TLS server.
(Added in 7.34.0)
.IP "--tr-encoding"
(HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one of the
algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data while receiving it.

(Added in 7.21.6)
.IP "--trace <file>"
Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including
descriptive information, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have
the output sent to stdout.

This option overrides previous uses of \fI-v, --verbose\fP or
\fI--trace-ascii\fP.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--trace-ascii <file>"
Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including
descriptive information, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have
the output sent to stdout.

This is very similar to \fI--trace\fP, but leaves out the hex part and only
shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output that might be easier
to read for untrained humans.

This option overrides previous uses of \fI-v, --verbose\fP or \fI--trace\fP.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--trace-time"
Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl displays.
(Added in 7.14.0)
.IP "--unix-socket <path>"
(HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using the
network. (Added in 7.40.0)
.IP "-u, --user <user:password>"
Specify the user name and password to use for server authentication. Overrides
\fI-n, --netrc\fP and \fI--netrc-optional\fP.

If you simply specify the user name, curl will prompt for a password.

The user name and passwords are split up on the first colon, which makes it
impossible to use a colon in the user name with this option. The password can,
still.

When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should include the
Windows domain name in the user name, in order for the server to successfully
obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you don't then the initial authentication
handshake may fail.

When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the user name,
without the domain, if there is a single domain and forest in your setup
for example.

To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or UPN (User
Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\\user and user@example.com
respectively.

If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Kerberos V5,
Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can tell curl to select
the user name and password from your environment by specifying a single colon
with this option: "-u :".

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-U, --proxy-user <user:password>"
Specify the user name and password to use for proxy authentication.

If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either Negotiate or NTLM
authentication then you can tell curl to select the user name and password
from your environment by specifying a single colon with this option: "-U :".

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--url <URL>"
Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you want to specify
URL(s) in a config file.

This option may be used any number of times. To control where this URL is
written, use the \fI-o, --output\fP or the \fI-O, --remote-name\fP options.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Be more verbose/talkative during the operation. Useful for debugging and
seeing what's going on "under the hood". A line starting with '>' means
"header data" sent by curl, '<' means "header data" received by curl that is
hidden in normal cases, and a line starting with '*' means additional info
provided by curl.

Note that if you only want HTTP headers in the output, \fI-i, --include\fP
might be the option you're looking for.

If you think this option still doesn't give you enough details, consider using
\fI--trace\fP or \fI--trace-ascii\fP instead.

This option overrides previous uses of \fI--trace-ascii\fP or \fI--trace\fP.

Use \fI-s, --silent\fP to make curl quiet.
.IP "-w, --write-out <format>"
Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. The format
is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of
variables. The format can be specified as a literal "string", or you can have
curl read the format from a file with "@filename" and to tell curl to read the
format from stdin you write "@-".

The variables present in the output format will be substituted by the value or
text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All variables are specified
as %{variable_name} and to output a normal % you just write them as
%%. You can output a newline by using \\n, a carriage return with \\r and a tab
space with \\t.

.B NOTE:
The %-symbol is a special symbol in the win32-environment, where all
occurrences of % must be doubled when using this option.

The variables available are:
.RS
.TP 15
.B content_type
The Content-Type of the requested document, if there was any.
.TP
.B filename_effective
The ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only meaningful if curl
is told to write to a file with the \fI--remote-name\fP or \fI--output\fP
option. It's most useful in combination with the \fI--remote-header-name\fP
option. (Added in 7.25.1)

connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final transaction was
started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple
redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)
.TP
.B time_starttransfer
The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just
about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the

displayed with millisecond resolution.
.TP
.B url_effective
The URL that was fetched last. This is most meaningful if you've told curl
to follow location: headers.
.RE
.IP
If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-x, --proxy <[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]>"
Use the specified proxy.

The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or
socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol
specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP proxies. (The
protocol support was added in curl 7.21.7)

If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be
1080.

This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy to
use. If there's an environment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy to
\&"" to override it.

All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be
converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific operations might
not be available. This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as
one with the \fI-p, --proxytunnel\fP option.

User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded
by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such as @ by using %40
or pass in a colon with %3a.

The proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the proxy environment
variables, including the protocol prefix (http://) and the embedded user +
password.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-X, --request <command>"
(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the
HTTP server.  The specified request method will be used instead of the method
otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for
details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT and
DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and
more.

Normally you don't need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT
requests are rather invoked by using dedicated command line options.

This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not
alter the way curl behaves. So for example if you want to make a proper HEAD
request, using -X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the \fI-I, --head\fP
option.

The method string you set with -X will be used for all requests, which if you
for example use \fB-L, --location\fP may cause unintended side-effects when
curl doesn't change request method according to the HTTP 30x response codes -
and similar.

(FTP)
Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when doing file lists
with FTP.

(POP3)
Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or RETR. (Added in
7.26.0)

(IMAP)
Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST. (Added in 7.30.0)

(SMTP)
Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "--xattr"
When saving output to a file, this option tells curl to store certain file
metadata in extended file attributes. Currently, the URL is stored in the
xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP, the content type is stored in
the mime_type attribute. If the file system does not support extended
attributes, a warning is issued.

.IP "-y, --speed-time <time>"
If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second during a speed-time
period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is used, the default
speed-limit will be 1 unless set with \fI-Y\fP.

This option controls transfers and thus will not affect slow connects etc. If
this is a concern for you, try the \fI--connect-timeout\fP option.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-Y, --speed-limit <speed>"
If a download is slower than this given speed (in bytes per second) for
speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set with \fI-y\fP and is 30
if not set.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-z, --time-cond <date expression>|<file>"
(HTTP/FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the given time and
date, or one that has been modified before that time. The <date expression>
can be all sorts of date strings or if it doesn't match any internal ones, it
is taken as a filename and tries to get the modification date (mtime) from
<file> instead. See the \fIcurl_getdate(3)\fP man pages for date expression
details.

Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for a document
that is older than the given date/time, default is a document that is newer
than the specified date/time.

If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
.IP "-h, --help"
Usage help. This lists all current command line options with a short
description.
.IP "-M, --manual"
Manual. Display the huge help text.
.IP "-V, --version"
Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl and other 3rd party
libraries linked with the executable.

The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows all protocols that libcurl
reports to support.

The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features libcurl
reports to offer. Available features include:
.RS
.IP "IPv6"
You can use IPv6 with this.
.IP "krb4"
Krb4 for FTP is supported.
.IP "SSL"
SSL versions of various protocols are supported, such as HTTPS, FTPS, POP3S
and so on.
.IP "libz"
Automatic decompression of compressed files over HTTP is supported.
.IP "NTLM"
NTLM authentication is supported.
.IP "Debug"
This curl uses a libcurl built with Debug. This enables more error-tracking
and memory debugging etc. For curl-developers only!
.IP "AsynchDNS"
This curl uses asynchronous name resolves. Asynchronous name resolves can be
done using either the c-ares or the threaded resolver backends.
.IP "SPNEGO"
SPNEGO authentication is supported.
.IP "Largefile"
This curl supports transfers of large files, files larger than 2GB.
.IP "IDN"
This curl supports IDN - international domain names.
.IP "GSS-API"
GSS-API is supported.
.IP "SSPI"
SSPI is supported.
.IP "TLS-SRP"
SRP (Secure Remote Password) authentication is supported for TLS.
.IP "HTTP2"
HTTP/2 support has been built-in.
.IP "Metalink"
This curl supports Metalink (both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854)), which
describes mirrors and hashes.  curl will use mirrors for failover if
there are errors (such as the file or server not being available).
.RE
.SH FILES
.I ~/.curlrc
.RS
Default config file, see \fI-K, --config\fP for details.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case. The
lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it is only
available in lower case.

Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as using
the \fI--proxy\fP option.

.IP "http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]"
Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.
.IP "HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]"
Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.
.IP "[url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]"
Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the protocol is a
protocol that curl supports and as specified in a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP,
SMTP, LDAP etc.
.IP "ALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]"
Sets the proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is set.
.IP "NO_PROXY <comma-separated list of hosts>"
list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy. If set to a asterisk
\&'*' only, it matches all hosts.
.SH "PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES"
Since curl version 7.21.7, the proxy string may be specified with a
protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.

If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string doesn't match
a supported one, the proxy will be treated as an HTTP proxy.

The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:
.IP "socks4://"
Makes it the equivalent of \fI--socks4\fP
.IP "socks4a://"
Makes it the equivalent of \fI--socks4a\fP
.IP "socks5://"
Makes it the equivalent of \fI--socks5\fP
.IP "socks5h://"
Makes it the equivalent of \fI--socks5-hostname\fP
.SH EXIT CODES
There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding error
messages that may appear during bad conditions. At the time of this writing,
the exit codes are:
.IP 1
Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.
.IP 2

.IP 3
URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.
.IP 4
A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request was not
enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time. To make curl able to do
this, you probably need another build of libcurl!

Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.
.IP 7
Failed to connect to host.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by
.Ar list )
from each
.Ar file
and writes them to the standard output.
If no
.Ar file
arguments are specified, or a file argument is a single dash
.Pq Sq Fl ,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
The items specified by
.Ar list
can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited
by a special character.
Column numbering starts from 1.
.Pp
The
.Ar list
option argument
is a comma or whitespace separated set of numbers and/or
number ranges.
Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
.Pq Sq \- ,
and a second number
and select the fields or columns from the first number to the second,
inclusive.
Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from 1 to the last number.
Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from the last number to the end of the line.
Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.
If a field or column is specified multiple times, it will appear only
once in the output.
It is not an error to select fields or columns not present in the
input line.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies byte positions.
.It Fl c Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies character positions.
.It Fl d Ar delim
Use
.Ar delim
as the field delimiter character instead of the tab character.
.It Fl f Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies fields, separated in the input by the field delimiter character
(see the
.Fl d
option.)
Output fields are separated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter
character.
.It Fl n
Do not split multi-byte characters.
Characters will only be output if at least one byte is selected, and,
after a prefix of zero or more unselected bytes, the rest of the bytes
that form the character are selected.
.It Fl s
Suppress lines with no field delimiter characters.
Unless specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL
and
.Ev LC_CTYPE
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .

.SH NAME
dappprof \- profile user and lib function usage. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dappprof
[\-acehoTU] [\-u lib] { \-p PID | command }
.SH DESCRIPTION
dappprof prints details on user and library call times for processes
as a summary style aggragation. By default the user fuctions are
traced, options can be used to trace library activity. Output can
include function counts, elapsed times and on cpu times.

The elapsed times are interesting, to help identify functions
that take some time to complete (during which the process may
have slept). CPU time helps us identify syscalls that
are consuming CPU cycles to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.SH NAME
dapptrace \- trace user and library function usage. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dapptrace
[\-acdeFlhoU] [\-u lib] { \-p PID | command }
.SH DESCRIPTION
dapptrace prints details on user and library function calls. By
default it traces user functions only, options can be used to
trace library activity.

Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which
can identify both function calls that are slow to complete, and those
which are consuming CPU cycles.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.Dt darwinup 1
.Os Darwin
.Sh NAME
.Nm darwinup
.Nd Install, uninstall, and manage roots
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfnv
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Ar subcommand 
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
allows you to manage roots, or
archives, of files that replace parts of your system. This is useful
for installing a new version of a library or tool on your system while 
allowing you to uninstall the files and revert back to the originals 
safely and easily.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It \-d
Do not run helpful automation. See HELPFUL AUTOMATION below.
.It \-f
Force. Some operations will fail gracefully due to potentially unsafe 
situations, such as a root that installs a file where a directory is.
In order to have darwinup continue through such a situation, you can
pass the -f option.
.It \-n
Dry run. Darwinup will go through an operation, including analyzing
the root(s) and printing the state/change symbol, but no files will
be modified on your system and no records will be added to the depot.
This option implies -d.
.It \-p Op Ar path
Prefix path. Normally, darwinup will operate on the boot partition. You
can use the -p option to have darwinup work on another partition. You
can provide any arbitrary path, it does not need to be a mount point.
.It \-r
Restart. Gracefully restart after all operations are complete by telling
Finder to restart. 
.It \-v
Verbose. This option causes darwinup to print extra information. You can
pass 2 or 3 v's for even more information, but that is usually only needed
for development and debugging of darwinup itself.
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
Note that the
.Ar path
and
.Ar archive
options listed below support globbing and multiple items. See the EXAMPLES 
section below for more details.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It files Ar archives
List the files and directories in the 
.Ar archive .
.It install Ar path
Install the root at 
.Ar path .
.It list Op Ar archive
List archives that are installed. You may optionally provide an
archive specification to limit which archives get listed. 
.It rename Ar archive Ar name
Rename an archive.
.It uninstall Ar archives
Uninstall the specified archive.
.It upgrade Ar path
Find the last archive that was installed with the same name (basename of 
path), and replace it with the root at 
.Ar path .
.It verify Ar archive
List all of the information about 
.Ar archive .
This includes status letters
detailing how the archive differs from whats on disk
.El
.Sh STATE/CHANGE SYMBOLS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It ? 
Unknown state. Probably a bug.
.It !
Missing file during uninstall. Darwinup expected a file or directory to 
exist, but it did not. This could be a bug in darwinup, but most likely 
another tool or software update removed a file that darwinup had been 
tracking. It can also be caused by an installation failing due to an
object changing type (see FORCING OPERATIONS below), and the subsequent 
rollback finding the root only partially installed. Since these all 
happen during uninstall, they are typically safe to ignore, since darwinup 
was going to delete the object anyway.
.It A
Added. No previous file or directory existed so the file or directory was
added to your system.
.It E
External change. The file you are installing is different than the 
last file you installed, but it is identical to what was actually found
on disk. This probably means something manually installed a root or software
update without darwinup knowing about it. This is usually harmless. 
.It M 
Mode change. Only changes to permission or ownership were needed to
uninstall the file or directory. 
.It R
Removed. No previous file or directory existed, so the uninstall process
removed the file. 
.It U
Updated. During installation, the file or directory replaces an existing 
object at the same path. During uninstallation, the previous version of
the file was restored.
.It I
Ignored. A file specified in the removal list was not removed. This usually
indicates that the file was a directory and the path in the removal list lacked
a trailing
.Pa /
character.
.El
.Sh SUPPORTED PATHS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It /path/to/file-or-directory
You can install archive files or directories by specifying a relative or 
absolute path. If the path is a directory, all files below it will be 
installed as a single root. If the path points to a file, it must be one of
the suported archive file types as described in the usage statement. 
.It user@host:/path/to/file-or-directory
You can install files or directories from another host via rsync/ssh. 
The files/directories will be downloaded to your machine and then installed 
like any other root.
.It http[s]://host/path/to/file
You can install files from an archive hosted on an HTTP/HTTPS server. The
archive file will be downloaded using curl to your machine and then
installed like any other archive file. You can not point darwinup at a
directory hosted via HTTP or HTTPS, only archive files such as tarballs.  
.El
.Sh ARCHIVE SPECIFICATIONS
When running a subcommand which takes an 
.Ar archive
argument, you can use one or more of the following items to specify which
archive to operate on. You can mix and match any of them as needed. 
You can use the list subcommand with these specifications to see what will 
match.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Ar serial
You can specify an archive with its serial number, which can be found using
the list subcommand.
.It Ar uuid
You can specify an archive with its UUID, which can be found using the
list subcommand.
.It Ar name
You can specify an archive with its name, which can be found using the
list subcommand.
.It newest
The newest keyword will match the one archive which was most recently
installed. This should always be the first archive listed.
.It oldest
The oldest keyword will match the one archive which was installed the
longest time ago. This should always be the last archive listed. 
.It superseded
The superseded keyword will match zero or more archives. An archive is
superseded if every file it contains is contained in an archive that was
(and still is) installed after it. A file in an archive can also be superseded
by external changes, such as operating system updates. When uninstalling a
superseded archive, you should never see any status symbols, since being
superseded means there is a newer file on disk. 
.It all
The all keyword will match all archives. If you specify extra verbosity 
with -vv, then rollback archives will also be matched by the all keyword. This
means that 
.Nm darwinup -vv uninstall all
will attempt to uninstall rollback archives, which will print a message
about not being able to uninstall rollback archives. This is normal and
not a problem. 
.El
.Sh FORCING OPERATIONS
There are 2 cases where darwinup will require you to pass the force (-f)
option before proceeding with an operation.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Object Type Change
If you install an archive which contains a file with the same path as a 
directory on your system, or vice versa, darwinup will give you a error
about not doing that unless you really want to force it. If you do force
the operation, darwinup will delete the existing object and replace it with
the object from the root. This can happen when a directory full of files
gets packaged up in some opaque file, like xibs/nibs. If you expect this
"type change", then it is probably safe to force the operation. 
.It Uninstall a root from an older base system
Darwinup remembers the version (build) of the operating system when a root
is installed. The reason for this is darwinup saves the old (replaced)
files during the installation procedure. Those backups may have come from
the older operating system, and thus are not necessarily compatible with
the current build of the operating system. So if you try to uninstall an
archive that had been installed on a different version of the operating
system, darwinup will stop and provide a message asking you to force the
operation if you really want to. If the files you are uninstalling are all
superseded, then you should not get this error as the backup copies will
not be used anyway. 
.El
.Sh HELPFUL AUTOMATION
Darwinup tries to detect common situations and run external tools that you
would otherwise have to remember to run yourself. The "dry run" (-n) and 
"disable automation" (-d) options prevent any of the following from 
happening.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Dyld Cache
If a root modifies any file, then darwinup will run 
update_dyld_shared_cache unless the -d option is specified.
.It Kernel Extensions
If a root modifies a file under /System/Library/Extensions, then darwinup
will update the mtime of /System/Library/Extensions to ensure that the 
kext cache is updated during the next boot. 
.El
.Sh REMOVING FILES
.Nm
supports removing files from disk as part of installing a root. These files must
be enumerated in a list that is included in the root at the path
.Pa /.DarwinMetadata/removals .
The list is a simple text file consisting of paths to remove, separated by new
lines. Directories may be present in this list. If a directory is to be removed,
its path must include a trailing '/' character, and all of its descendants will
be removed. When files are removed as part of root installation, they will be
restored when the root is uninstalled with the
.Ar uninstall
command.
.Pp
It is permissible for the root to contain files that are specified in its
removal list. This is primarily useful for replacing entire directory
hierarchies as singular entities.
.Pp
.Em IMPORTANT :
Replacing a directory hierarchy can only be done safely is the root creator has
full knowledge of the contents of a given directory hierarchy and knows how to
completely populate it such that all dependencies will be satisfied. For
example, a project which installs content into
.Pa /usr/include
should
.Em not
specify that path in its removal list since many other projects populate that
directory. The result of the removal operation in such a case would be the only
the contents of the root would exist in
.Pa /usr/include
after the installation completes.
.Nm
cannot and does not protect against this scenario, so exercise extreme caution
when constructing roots with removal lists.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Neither the
.Pa .DarwinMetadata
directory nor its contents will be installed into the destination path.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Install files from a tarball
$ darwinup install library-1.2.3.tar.gz
.It Install several directories from /tmp/
$ darwinup install /tmp/*/*~dst/
.It Uninstall everything
$ darwinup uninstall all
.It See what archives have been superseded and then uninstall them
$ darwinup list superseded
$ darwinup uninstall superseded
.It Uninstall several archives by serial, the oldest one, and one named myroot
$ darwinup uninstall 9 16 myroot oldest
.It Install a root from src.macosforge.org

.Op Cm + Ns Ar output_fmt
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar dst
.Op Fl t Ar minutes_west
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When invoked without arguments, the
.Nm
utility displays the current date and time.
Otherwise, depending on the options specified,
.Nm
will set the date and time or print it in a user-defined way.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility displays the date and time read from the kernel clock.
When used to set the date and time,
both the kernel clock and the hardware clock are updated.
.Pp
Only the superuser may set the date,
and if the system securelevel (see
.Xr securelevel 8 )
is greater than 1,
the time may not be changed by more than 1 second.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar dst
Set the kernel's value for daylight saving time.
If
.Ar dst
is non-zero, future calls
to
.Xr gettimeofday 2
will return a non-zero for
.Fa tz_dsttime .
.It Fl f
Use
.Ar input_fmt
as the format string to parse the
.Ar new_date
provided rather than using the default
.Sm off
.Oo Oo Oo 
.Ar mm Oc
.Ar dd Oc
.Ar HH Oc
.Ar MM 
.Oo Oo
.Ar cc Oc
.Ar yy Oc Oo 
.Ar .ss Oc 
.Sm on
format.
Parsing is done using
.Xr strptime 3 .
.It Fl j
Do not try to set the date.
This allows you to use the
.Fl f
flag in addition to the
.Cm +
option to convert one date format to another.
.It Fl n
By default, if the
.Xr timed 8
daemon is running,
.Nm
sets the time on all of the machines in the local group.
The
.Fl n
option suppresses this behavior and causes the time to be set only on the
current machine.
.It Fl r Ar seconds
Print the date and time represented by
.Ar seconds ,
where
.Ar seconds
is the number of seconds since the Epoch
(00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970;
see
.Xr time 3 ) ,
and can be specified in decimal, octal, or hex.
.It Fl t Ar minutes_west
Set the system's value for minutes west of
.Tn GMT .
.Ar minutes_west
specifies the number of minutes returned in
.Fa tz_minuteswest
by future calls to
.Xr gettimeofday 2 .
.It Fl u
Display or set the date in
.Tn UTC
(Coordinated Universal) time.
.It Fl v
Adjust (i.e., take the current date and display the result of the
adjustment; not actually set the date) the second, minute, hour, month
day, week day, month or year according to
.Ar val .
If
.Ar val
is preceded with a plus or minus sign,
the date is adjusted forwards or backwards according to the remaining string,
otherwise the relevant part of the date is set.
The date can be adjusted as many times as required using these flags.
Flags are processed in the order given.
.Pp
When setting values
(rather than adjusting them),
seconds are in the range 0-59, minutes are in the range 0-59, hours are
in the range 0-23, month days are in the range 1-31, week days are in the
range 0-6 (Sun-Sat),
months are in the range 1-12 (Jan-Dec)
and years are in the range 80-38 or 1980-2038.
.Pp
If
.Ar val
is numeric, one of either
.Ar y ,
.Ar m ,
.Ar w ,
.Ar d ,
.Ar H ,
.Ar M
or
.Ar S
must be used to specify which part of the date is to be adjusted.
.Pp
The week day or month may be specified using a name rather than a
number.
If a name is used with the plus
(or minus)
sign, the date will be put forwards
(or backwards)
to the next
(previous)
date that matches the given week day or month.
This will not adjust the date,
if the given week day or month is the same as the current one.
.Pp
When a date is adjusted to a specific value or in units greater than hours,
daylight savings time considerations are ignored.
Adjustments in units of hours or less honor daylight saving time.
So, assuming the current date is March 26, 0:30 and that the DST adjustment
means that the clock goes forward at 01:00 to 02:00, using
.Fl v No +1H
will adjust the date to March 26, 2:30.
Likewise, if the date is October 29, 0:30 and the DST adjustment means that
the clock goes back at 02:00 to 01:00, using
.Fl v No +3H
will be necessary to reach October 29, 2:30.
.Pp
When the date is adjusted to a specific value that does not actually exist
(for example March 26, 1:30 BST 2000 in the Europe/London timezone),
the date will be silently adjusted forwards in units of one hour until it
reaches a valid time.
When the date is adjusted to a specific value that occurs twice
(for example October 29, 1:30 2000),
the resulting timezone will be set so that the date matches the earlier of
the two times.
.Pp
Adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because
a month is a unit of variable length depending on the current date.
This kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive way.
First of all,
.Nm
tries to preserve the day of the month.
If it is impossible because the target month is shorter than the present one,
the last day of the target month will be the result.
For example, using
.Fl v No +1m
on May 31 will adjust the date to June 30, while using the same option
on January 30 will result in the date adjusted to the last day of February.
This approach is also believed to make the most sense for shell scripting.
Nevertheless, be aware that going forth and back by the same number of
months may take you to a different date.
.Pp
Refer to the examples below for further details.
.El
.Pp
An operand with a leading plus
.Pq Sq +
sign signals a user-defined format string
which specifies the format in which to display the date and time.
The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications
described in the
.Xr strftime 3
manual page, as well as any arbitrary text.
A newline
.Pq Ql \en
character is always output after the characters specified by
the format string.
The format string for the default display is
.Dq +%+ .
.Pp
If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as
a value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.
The canonical representation for setting the date and time is:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar cc
Century
(either 19 or 20)
prepended to the abbreviated year.
.It Ar yy
Year in abbreviated form
(e.g., 89 for 1989, 06 for 2006).
.It Ar mm
Numeric month, a number from 1 to 12.
.It Ar dd
Day, a number from 1 to 31.
.It Ar HH
Hour, a number from 0 to 23.
.It Ar MM
Minutes, a number from 0 to 59.
.It Ar ss
Seconds, a number from 0 to 61
(59 plus a maximum of two leap seconds).
.El
.Pp
Everything but the minutes is optional.
.Pp
Time changes for Daylight Saving Time, standard time, leap seconds,
and leap years are handled automatically.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TZ
The timezone to use when displaying dates.
The normal format is a pathname relative to
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo .
For example, the command
.Dq TZ=America/Los_Angeles date
displays the current time in California.
See
.Xr environ 7
for more information.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/messages -compact
.It Pa /var/log/messages

.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, 1 if unable to set the date, and 2
if able to set the local date, but unable to set it globally.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.Dl "date ""+DATE: %Y-%m-%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S"""
.Pp

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
utility writes the pathnames of log files that are no longer in use (for example, no longer involved in active transactions), to the standard output, one pathname per line. These log files should be written to backup media to provide for recovery in the case of catastrophic failure (which also requires a snapshot of the database files), but they may then be deleted from the system to reclaim disk space.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Fl a
Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of relative to the database home directories.
.It Fl d
Remove log files that are no longer needed; no filenames are written. Automatic log file removal is likely to make catastrophic recovery impossible.
.It Fl h
Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory is used.
.It Fl l
Write out the pathnames of all the database log files, whether or not they are involved in active transactions.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl s
Write the pathnames of all the database files that need to be archived in order to recover the database from catastrophic failure. If any of the database files have not been accessed during the lifetime of the current log files, db_archive will not include them in this output.
.Pp
It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers have since been deleted from the system. In this case, db_archive will ignore them. When db_recover is run, any files to which the log refers that are not present during recovery are assumed to have been deleted and will not be recovered.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.It Fl v
Run in verbose mode, listing the checkpoints in the log files as they are reviewed.
.El
.Pp
Log cursor handles (returned by the DB_ENV->log_cursor method) may have open file descriptors for log files in the database environment. Also, the Berkeley DB interfaces to the database environment logging subsystem (for example, DB_ENV->log_put and DB_TXN->abort) may allocate log cursors and have open file descriptors for log files as well. On operating systems where filesystem related system calls (for example, rename and unlink on Windows/NT) can fail if a process has an open file descriptor for the affected file, attempting to move or remove the log files listed by db_archive may fail. All Berkeley DB internal use of log cursors operates on active log files only and furthermore, is short-lived in nature. So, an application seeing such a failure should be restructured to close any open log cursors it may have, and otherwise to retry the operation until it succeeds. (Although the latter is not likely to be necessary; it is hard to imagine a reason to move or rename a log file in which transactions are being logged or aborted.)
.Pp
The db_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, db_archive should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_archive to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
.Pp
The DB_ENV->log_archive method is the underlying method used by the db_archive utility. See the db_archive utility source code for an example of using DB_ENV->log_archive in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environment.
.Pp
The 
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
utility reads the database file file and writes it to the standard output using a portable flat-text format understood by the db_load utility. The file argument must be a file produced using the Berkeley DB library functions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Fl d
Dump the specified database in a format helpful for debugging the Berkeley DB library routines.
.Bl -tag -width
.It a
Display all information.
.It h
Display only page headers.
.It r
Do not display the free-list or pages on the free list. This mode is used by the recovery tests.
.El
.Pp
.Em The output format of the -d option is not standard and may change, without notice, between releases of the Berkeley DB library.
.It Fl f
Write to the specified file instead of to the standard output.
.It Fl h
Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory is used.
.It Fl k
Dump record numbers from Queue and Recno databases as keys.
.It Fl l
List the databases stored in the file.
.It Fl N
Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl p
If characters in either the key or data items are printing characters (as defined by isprint(3)), use printing characters in file to represent them. This option permits users to use standard text editors and tools to modify the contents of databases.
.Pp
Note: different systems may have different notions about what characters are considered 
.Em printing characters,
and databases dumped in this manner may be less portable to external systems.
.It Fl R
Aggressively salvage data from a possibly corrupt file. The -R flag differs from the -r option in that it will return all possible data from the file at the risk of also returning already deleted or otherwise nonsensical items. Data dumped in this fashion will almost certainly have to be edited by hand or other means before the data is ready for reload into another database
.It Fl r
Salvage data from a possibly corrupt file. When used on a uncorrupted database, this option should return equivalent data to a normal dump, but most likely in a different order.
.It Fl s
Specify a single database to dump. If no database is specified, all databases in the database file are dumped.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.El
.Pp
Dumping and reloading Hash databases that use user-defined hash functions will result in new databases that use the default hash function. Although using the default hash function may not be optimal for the new database, it will continue to work correctly.
.Pp
Dumping and reloading Btree databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison functions will result in new databases that use the default prefix and comparison functions. 
.Em \&In this case, it is quite likely that the database will be damaged beyond repair permitting neither record storage or retrieval.
.Pp
The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources for the db_load utility to load the database using the correct hash, prefix, and comparison functions.
.Pp
The 
.Nm
utility output format is documented in the Dump Output Formats section of the Berkeley DB Reference Guide.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, 
.Nm
should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
.Nm 
to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
.Pp
Even when using a Berkeley DB database environment, the
.Nm
utility does not use any kind of database locking if it is invoked with the -d, -R, or -r arguments. If used with one of these arguments, the
.Nm
utility may only be safely run on databases that are not being modified by any other process; otherwise, the output may be corrupt.
.Pp
The 
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
utility reads from the standard input and loads it into the database file. The database file is created if it does not already exist.
.Pp
The input to
.Nm
must be in the output format specified by the db_dump utility, utilities, or as specified for the -T below.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Fl c
Specify configuration options ignoring any value they may have based on the input. The command-line format is name=value. See the Supported Keywords section below for a list of keywords supported by the -c option.
.It Fl f
Read from the specified input file instead of from the standard input.
.It Fl h
Specify a home directory for the database environment.
.Pp
If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened using the Db.DB_INIT_LOCK, Db.DB_INIT_LOG, Db.DB_INIT_MPOOL, Db.DB_INIT_TXN, and Db.DB_USE_ENVIRON flags to DB_ENV->open. (This means that db_load can be used to load data into databases while they are in use by other processes.) If the DB_ENV->open call fails, or if no home directory is specified, the database is still updated, but the environment is ignored; for example, no locking is done.
.It Fl n
Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an already existing database. If a key/data pair cannot be loaded into the database for this reason, a warning message is displayed on the standard error output, and the key/data pair are skipped.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl T
The -T option allows non-Berkeley DB applications to easily load text files into databases.
.Pp
If the database to be created is of type Btree or Hash, or the keyword keys is specified as set, the input must be paired lines of text, where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second line of the pair is its corresponding data item. If the database to be created is of type Queue or Recno and the keyword keys is not set, the input must be lines of text, where each line is a new data item for the database.
.Pp
A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (\) characters are special, is applied to the text input. Newline characters are interpreted as record separators. Backslash characters in the text will be interpreted in one of two ways: If the backslash character precedes another backslash character, the pair will be interpreted as a literal backslash. If the backslash character precedes any other character, the two characters following the backslash will be interpreted as a hexadecimal specification of a single character; for example, \0a is a newline character in the ASCII character set.
.Pp
For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by db_load.
.Pp
If the -T option is specified, the underlying access method type must be specified using the -t option.
.It Fl t
Specify the underlying access method. If no -t option is specified, the database will be loaded into a database of the same type as was dumped; for example, a Hash database will be created if a Hash database was dumped.
.Pp
Btree and Hash databases may be converted from one to the other. Queue and Recno databases may be converted from one to the other. If the -k option was specified on the call to db_dump then Queue and Recno databases may be converted to Btree or Hash, with the key being the integer record number.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.El
.Pp
The db_load utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, db_load should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_load to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
.Pp
The db_load utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more key/data pairs were not loaded into the database because the key already existed, and >1 if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm
utility can be used to load text files into databases. For example, the following command loads the standard UNIX /etc/passwd file into a database, with the login name as the key item and the entire password entry as the data item:
.Bd -ragged -offset 5
awk -F: '{print $1; print $0}' < /etc/passwd |
    sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | db_load -T -t hash passwd.db
.Ed
.Pp
Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are escaped to avoid interpretation as escape characters by db_load.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT      \" May not be needed
.Bl -tag -width "DB_HOME" \" ENV_VAR_1 is width of the string ENV_VAR_1
.It Ev DB_HOME
If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV->open.
.El
.Sh SUPPORTED KEYWORDS
The following keywords are supported for the -c command-line option to the
.Nm
utility. See DB->open for further discussion of these keywords and what values should be specified.
.Pp
The parenthetical listing specifies how the value part of the name=value pair is interpreted. Items listed as (boolean) expect value to be 1 (set) or 0 (unset). Items listed as (number) convert value to a number. Items listed as (string) use the string value without modification.
.Bl -tag -width

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
utility must be run after an unexpected application, Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the database to a consistent state. All committed transactions are guaranteed to appear after db_recover has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Fl c
Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal recovery.
.It Fl e
Retain the environment after running recovery. This option will rarely be used unless a DB_CONFIG file is present in the home directory. If a DB_CONFIG file is not present, then the regions will be created with default parameter values.
.It Fl h
Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory is used.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl t
Recover to the time specified rather than to the most current possible date. The timestamp argument should be in the form [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] where each pair of letters represents the following:
.Bl -tag -width
.It CC
The first two digits of the year (the century).
.It YY
The second two digits of the year. If "YY" is specified, but "CC" is not, a value for "YY" between 69 and 99 results in a "YY" value of 19. Otherwise, a "YY" value of 20 is used.
.It MM
The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
.It DD
The day of the month, from 1 to 31.
.It hh
The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
.It mm
The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
.It SS
The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
.El
If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current year. If the "SS" letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.It Fl v
Run in verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
In the case of catastrophic recovery, an archival copy -- or snapshot -- of all database files must be restored along with all of the log files written since the database file snapshot was made. (If disk space is a problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links). For further information on creating a database snapshot, see Archival Procedures. For further information on performing recovery, see Recovery Procedures.
.Pp
If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at the time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.
.Pp
If log files are missing, db_recover will identify the missing log file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be restored and recovery performed again.
.Pp
The db_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, db_recover should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_recover to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
.Pp
The db_recover utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

The
.Nm
utility upgrades the Berkeley DB version of one or more files and the databases they contain to the current release version.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Fl h
Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory is used.
.It Fl N
Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl s
This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases before the Berkeley DB 3.1 release.
.Pp
As part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1 release, the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed. To correctly upgrade the format requires that applications specify whether duplicate data items in the database are sorted or not. Specifying the -s flag means that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are assumed to be unsorted. Incorrectly specifying the value of this flag may lead to database corruption.
.Pp
Because the
.Nm
utility upgrades a physical file (including all the databases it contains), it is not possible to use
.Nm
to upgrade files where some of the databases it includes have sorted duplicate data items, and some of the databases it includes have unsorted duplicate data items. If the file does not have more than a single database, if the databases do not support duplicate data items, or if all the databases that support duplicate data items support the same style of duplicates (either sorted or unsorted),
.Nm
will work correctly as long as the -s flag is correctly specified. Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded using
.Nm ,
and must be upgraded manually using the db_dump and db_load utilities.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Em \&It is important to realize that Berkeley DB database upgrades are done in place, and so are potentially destructive. 
This means that if the system crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure runs out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and unrecoverable state. See Upgrading databases for more information.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,

The

If the file being verified contains databases with non-default comparison or hashing configurations, calling the

.Nm
to ignore database sort or hash ordering and allows

.It Fl N
Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.
.It Fl P
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line arguments.
.It Fl q
Suppress the printing of any error descriptions, simply exit success or failure.
.It Fl V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Em The
.Nm
utility does not perform any locking, even in Berkeley DB environments that are configured with a locking subsystem. As such, it should only be used on files that are not being modified by another thread of control.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, 
.Nm
should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause 
.Nm
to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
.Pp
The 
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

dbilogstrip \- filter to normalize DBI trace logs for diff'ing
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Read \s-1DBI\s0 trace file \f(CW\*(C`dbitrace.log\*(C'\fR and write out a stripped version to \f(CW\*(C`dbitrace_stripped.log\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  dbilogstrip dbitrace.log > dbitrace_stripped.log
.Ve
.PP
Run \f(CW\*(C`yourscript.pl\*(C'\fR twice, each with different sets of arguments, with
\&\s-1DBI_TRACE\s0 enabled. Filter the output and trace through \f(CW\*(C`dbilogstrip\*(C'\fR into a
separate file for each run. Then compare using diff. (This example assumes
you're using a standard shell.)
.PP

Replaces any hex addresses, e.g, \f(CW0x128f72ce\fR with \f(CW\*(C`0xN\*(C'\fR.

Replaces any references to process id or thread id, like \f(CW\*(C`pid#6254\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`pidN\*(C'\fR.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This tool is a command-line client for the DBI::ProfileData.  It
allows you to analyze the profile data file produced by
DBI::ProfileDumper and produce various useful reports.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This program accepts the following options:
.IP "\-\-number N" 4
.IX Item "--number N"
Produce this many items in the report.  Defaults to 10.  If set to
\&\*(L"all\*(R" then all results are shown.
.IP "\-\-sort field" 4
.IX Item "--sort field"
Sort results by the given field. Sorting by multiple fields isn't currently
supported (patches welcome).  The available sort fields are:
.RS 4
.IP "total" 4
.IX Item "total"
Sorts by total time run time across all runs.  This is the default
sort.
.IP "longest" 4
.IX Item "longest"
Sorts by the longest single run.
.IP "count" 4
.IX Item "count"
Sorts by total number of runs.
.IP "first" 4
.IX Item "first"
Sorts by the time taken in the first run.
.IP "shortest" 4
.IX Item "shortest"
Sorts by the shortest single run.
.IP "key1" 4
.IX Item "key1"
Sorts by the value of the first element in the Path, which should be numeric.
You can also sort by \f(CW\*(C`key2\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`key3\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\-\-reverse" 4
.IX Item "--reverse"
Reverses the selected sort.  For example, to see a report of the
shortest overall time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-sort total \-\-reverse
.Ve
.IP "\-\-match keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--match keyN=value"
Consider only items where the specified key matches the given value.
Keys are numbered from 1.  For example, let's say you used a
DBI::Profile Path of:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  [ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]
.Ve
.Sp
And called dbiprof as in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key2=execute
.Ve
.Sp
Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out prepares,
fetches, etc.
.Sp
If the value given starts and ends with slashes (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be
treated as a regular expression.  For example, to only include \s-1SELECT\s0
queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^SELECT/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the match expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-exclude keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--exclude keyN=value"
Remove items for where the specified key matches the given value.  For
example, to exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the method name:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-exclude key2=prepare
.Ve
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-match\*(C'\fR, If the value given starts and ends with slashes
(\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be treated as a regular expression.  For example,
to exclude \s-1UPDATE\s0 queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^UPDATE/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the exclude expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-case\-sensitive" 4
.IX Item "--case-sensitive"
Using this option causes \-\-match and \-\-exclude to work
case-sensitively.  Defaults to off.
.IP "\-\-delete" 4
.IX Item "--delete"
Sets the \f(CW\*(C`DeleteFiles\*(C'\fR option to DBI::ProfileData which causes the
files to be deleted after reading. See DBI::ProfileData for more details.
.IP "\-\-dumpnodes" 4
.IX Item "--dumpnodes"
Print the list of nodes in the form of a perl data structure.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-sort\*(C'\fR option if you want the list sorted.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the dbiprof version number and exit.

.IP "\-\-reverse" 4
.IX Item "--reverse"
Reverses the selected sort.  For example, to see a report of the
shortest overall time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-sort total \-\-reverse
.Ve
.IP "\-\-match keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--match keyN=value"
Consider only items where the specified key matches the given value.
Keys are numbered from 1.  For example, let's say you used a
DBI::Profile Path of:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  [ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]
.Ve
.Sp
And called dbiprof as in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key2=execute
.Ve
.Sp
Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out prepares,
fetches, etc.
.Sp
If the value given starts and ends with slashes (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be
treated as a regular expression.  For example, to only include \s-1SELECT\s0
queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^SELECT/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the match expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-exclude keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--exclude keyN=value"
Remove items for where the specified key matches the given value.  For
example, to exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the method name:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-exclude key2=prepare
.Ve
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-match\*(C'\fR, If the value given starts and ends with slashes
(\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be treated as a regular expression.  For example,
to exclude \s-1UPDATE\s0 queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^UPDATE/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the exclude expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-case\-sensitive" 4
.IX Item "--case-sensitive"
Using this option causes \-\-match and \-\-exclude to work
case-sensitively.  Defaults to off.
.IP "\-\-delete" 4
.IX Item "--delete"
Sets the \f(CW\*(C`DeleteFiles\*(C'\fR option to DBI::ProfileData which causes the
files to be deleted after reading. See DBI::ProfileData for more details.
.IP "\-\-dumpnodes" 4
.IX Item "--dumpnodes"
Print the list of nodes in the form of a perl data structure.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-sort\*(C'\fR option if you want the list sorted.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the dbiprof version number and exit.

This tool is a command-line client for the DBI::ProfileData.  It
allows you to analyze the profile data file produced by
DBI::ProfileDumper and produce various useful reports.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This program accepts the following options:
.IP "\-\-number N" 4
.IX Item "--number N"
Produce this many items in the report.  Defaults to 10.  If set to
\&\*(L"all\*(R" then all results are shown.
.IP "\-\-sort field" 4
.IX Item "--sort field"
Sort results by the given field. Sorting by multiple fields isn't currently
supported (patches welcome).  The available sort fields are:
.RS 4
.IP "total" 4
.IX Item "total"
Sorts by total time run time across all runs.  This is the default
sort.
.IP "longest" 4
.IX Item "longest"
Sorts by the longest single run.
.IP "count" 4
.IX Item "count"
Sorts by total number of runs.
.IP "first" 4
.IX Item "first"
Sorts by the time taken in the first run.
.IP "shortest" 4
.IX Item "shortest"
Sorts by the shortest single run.
.IP "key1" 4
.IX Item "key1"
Sorts by the value of the first element in the Path, which should be numeric.
You can also sort by \f(CW\*(C`key2\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`key3\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\-\-reverse" 4
.IX Item "--reverse"
Reverses the selected sort.  For example, to see a report of the
shortest overall time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-sort total \-\-reverse
.Ve
.IP "\-\-match keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--match keyN=value"
Consider only items where the specified key matches the given value.
Keys are numbered from 1.  For example, let's say you used a
DBI::Profile Path of:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  [ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]
.Ve
.Sp
And called dbiprof as in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key2=execute
.Ve
.Sp
Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out prepares,
fetches, etc.
.Sp
If the value given starts and ends with slashes (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be
treated as a regular expression.  For example, to only include \s-1SELECT\s0
queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^SELECT/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the match expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-exclude keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--exclude keyN=value"
Remove items for where the specified key matches the given value.  For
example, to exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the method name:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-exclude key2=prepare
.Ve
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-match\*(C'\fR, If the value given starts and ends with slashes
(\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be treated as a regular expression.  For example,
to exclude \s-1UPDATE\s0 queries where key1 is the statement:

.Ve
.Sp
By default the exclude expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-case\-sensitive" 4
.IX Item "--case-sensitive"
Using this option causes \-\-match and \-\-exclude to work
case-sensitively.  Defaults to off.
.IP "\-\-delete" 4
.IX Item "--delete"
Sets the \f(CW\*(C`DeleteFiles\*(C'\fR option to DBI::ProfileData which causes the
files to be deleted after reading. See DBI::ProfileData for more details.
.IP "\-\-dumpnodes" 4
.IX Item "--dumpnodes"
Print the list of nodes in the form of a perl data structure.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-sort\*(C'\fR option if you want the list sorted.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the dbiprof version number and exit.

This tool is just a front end for the DBI::ProxyServer package. All it
does is picking options from the command line and calling
\&\fIDBI::ProxyServer::main()\fR. See DBI::ProxyServer for details.
.PP
Available options include:
.IP "\fB\-\-chroot=dir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--chroot=dir"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only)  After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change root directory to the given
directory by doing a \fIchroot()\fR. This is useful for security, but it
restricts the environment a lot. For example, you need to load \s-1DBI\s0
drivers in the config file or you have to create hard links to Unix
sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example, with MySQL, a
config file might contain the following lines:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    my $rootdir = \*(Aq/var/dbiproxy\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockdir = \*(Aq/tmp\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockfile = \*(Aqmysql.sock\*(Aq;
\&    foreach $dir ($rootdir, "$rootdir$unixsockdir") {
\&        mkdir 0755, $dir;
\&    }
\&    link("$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile",
\&         "$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile");
\&    require DBD::mysql;
\&
\&    {
\&        \*(Aqchroot\*(Aq => $rootdir,
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't know \fIchroot()\fR, think of an \s-1FTP\s0 server where you can see a
certain directory tree only after logging in. See also the \-\-group and
\&\-\-user options.
.IP "\fB\-\-configfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--configfile=file"
Config files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides the
arguments of the new method. However, command line arguments in turn take
precedence over the config file. See the \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION FILE\*(R"\s0 section
in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for details on the config file.
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debug"
Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages of
level \*(L"debug\*(R" are created.
.IP "\fB\-\-facility=mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--facility=mode"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is
\&\fBdaemon\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-group=gid\fR" 4
.IX Item "--group=gid"
After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change the real and effective \s-1GID\s0 to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don't want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-user option.
.Sp
\&\s-1GID\s0's can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fB\-\-localaddr=ip\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localaddr=ip"
By default a daemon is listening to any \s-1IP\s0 number that a machine
has. This attribute allows to restrict the server to the given
\&\s-1IP\s0 number.
.IP "\fB\-\-localport=port\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localport=port"
This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It
must be given somehow, as there's no default.
.IP "\fB\-\-logfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--logfile=file"
Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or
to the event log (Windows \s-1NT\s0). On other operating systems you need to
specify a log file. The special value \*(L"\s-1STDERR\*(R"\s0 forces logging to
stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.
.IP "\fB\-\-mode=modename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mode=modename"
The server can run in three different modes, depending on the environment.
.Sp
If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then the
server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread will
execute the server's \fIRun()\fR method and then terminate. This mode is the
default, you can force it with \*(L"\-\-mode=threads\*(R".
.Sp
If threads are not available, but you have a working \fIfork()\fR, then the
server will behave similar by creating a new process for each connection.
This mode will be used automatically in the absence of threads or if
you use the \*(L"\-\-mode=fork\*(R" option.
.Sp
Finally there's a single-connection mode: If the server has accepted a
connection, he will enter the \fIRun()\fR method. No other connections are
accepted until the \fIRun()\fR method returns (if the client disconnects).
This operation mode is useful if you have neither threads nor \fIfork()\fR,
for example on the Macintosh. For debugging purposes you can force this
mode with \*(L"\-\-mode=single\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-pidfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pidfile=file"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only) If this option is present, a \s-1PID\s0 file will be created at the
given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.
.IP "\fB\-\-user=uid\fR" 4
.IX Item "--user=uid"
After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change the real and effective \s-1UID\s0 to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don't want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-group and the \-\-chroot options.
.Sp
\&\s-1UID\s0's can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Suppresses startup of the server; instead the version string will
be printed and the program exits immediately.

.SH "NAME"
dbiproxy \- A proxy server for the DBD::Proxy driver
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    dbiproxy <options> \-\-localport=<port>
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This tool is just a front end for the DBI::ProxyServer package. All it
does is picking options from the command line and calling
\&\fIDBI::ProxyServer::main()\fR. See DBI::ProxyServer for details.
.PP
Available options include:
.IP "\fB\-\-chroot=dir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--chroot=dir"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only)  After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change root directory to the given
directory by doing a \fIchroot()\fR. This is useful for security, but it
restricts the environment a lot. For example, you need to load \s-1DBI\s0
drivers in the config file or you have to create hard links to Unix
sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example, with MySQL, a
config file might contain the following lines:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    my $rootdir = \*(Aq/var/dbiproxy\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockdir = \*(Aq/tmp\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockfile = \*(Aqmysql.sock\*(Aq;
\&    foreach $dir ($rootdir, "$rootdir$unixsockdir") {
\&        mkdir 0755, $dir;
\&    }
\&    link("$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile",
\&         "$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile");
\&    require DBD::mysql;
\&
\&    {
\&        \*(Aqchroot\*(Aq => $rootdir,
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't know \fIchroot()\fR, think of an \s-1FTP\s0 server where you can see a
certain directory tree only after logging in. See also the \-\-group and
\&\-\-user options.
.IP "\fB\-\-configfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--configfile=file"
Config files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides the
arguments of the new method. However, command line arguments in turn take
precedence over the config file. See the \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION FILE\*(R"\s0 section
in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for details on the config file.
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debug"
Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages of
level \*(L"debug\*(R" are created.
.IP "\fB\-\-facility=mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--facility=mode"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is
\&\fBdaemon\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-group=gid\fR" 4
.IX Item "--group=gid"
After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change the real and effective \s-1GID\s0 to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don't want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-user option.
.Sp
\&\s-1GID\s0's can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fB\-\-localaddr=ip\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localaddr=ip"
By default a daemon is listening to any \s-1IP\s0 number that a machine
has. This attribute allows to restrict the server to the given
\&\s-1IP\s0 number.
.IP "\fB\-\-localport=port\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localport=port"
This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It
must be given somehow, as there's no default.
.IP "\fB\-\-logfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--logfile=file"
Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or
to the event log (Windows \s-1NT\s0). On other operating systems you need to
specify a log file. The special value \*(L"\s-1STDERR\*(R"\s0 forces logging to
stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.
.IP "\fB\-\-mode=modename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mode=modename"
The server can run in three different modes, depending on the environment.
.Sp
If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then the
server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread will
execute the server's \fIRun()\fR method and then terminate. This mode is the
default, you can force it with \*(L"\-\-mode=threads\*(R".
.Sp
If threads are not available, but you have a working \fIfork()\fR, then the
server will behave similar by creating a new process for each connection.
This mode will be used automatically in the absence of threads or if
you use the \*(L"\-\-mode=fork\*(R" option.
.Sp
Finally there's a single-connection mode: If the server has accepted a
connection, he will enter the \fIRun()\fR method. No other connections are
accepted until the \fIRun()\fR method returns (if the client disconnects).
This operation mode is useful if you have neither threads nor \fIfork()\fR,
for example on the Macintosh. For debugging purposes you can force this
mode with \*(L"\-\-mode=single\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-pidfile=file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pidfile=file"
(\s-1UNIX\s0 only) If this option is present, a \s-1PID\s0 file will be created at the
given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.
.IP "\fB\-\-user=uid\fR" 4
.IX Item "--user=uid"
After doing a \fIbind()\fR, change the real and effective \s-1UID\s0 to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don't want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-group and the \-\-chroot options.
.Sp
\&\s-1UID\s0's can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Suppresses startup of the server; instead the version string will
be printed and the program exits immediately.

dbmmanage \- Manage user authentication files in DBM format

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
 
.PP
\fBdbmmanage\fR [ \fIencoding\fR ] \fIfilename\fR add|adduser|check|delete|update \fIusername\fR [ \fIencpasswd\fR [ \fIgroup\fR[,\fIgroup\fR\&.\&.\&.] [ \fIcomment\fR ] ] ]

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
dbmmanage is used to create and update the DBM format files used to store usernames and password for basic authentication of HTTP users via mod_authn_dbm\&. Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just the users listed in the files created by dbmmanage\&. This program can only be used when the usernames are stored in a DBM file\&. To use a flat-file database see htpasswd\&.
 
.PP
Another tool to maintain a DBM password database is htdbm\&.
 
.PP
This manual page only lists the command line arguments\&. For details of the directives necessary to configure user authentication in httpd see the httpd manual, which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at http://httpd\&.apache\&.org/\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
\fIfilename\fR
The filename of the DBM format file\&. Usually without the extension \&.db, \&.pag, or \&.dir\&.  
.TP
\fIusername\fR
The user for which the operations are performed\&. The \fIusername\fR may not contain a colon (:)\&.  
.TP
\fIencpasswd\fR
This is the already encrypted password to use for the update and add commands\&. You may use a hyphen (-) if you want to get prompted for the password, but fill in the fields afterwards\&. Additionally when using the update command, a period (\&.) keeps the original password untouched\&.  
.TP
\fIgroup\fR
A group, which the user is member of\&. A groupname may not contain a colon (:)\&. You may use a hyphen (-) if you don't want to assign the user to a group, but fill in the comment field\&. Additionally when using the update command, a period (\&.) keeps the original groups untouched\&.  
.TP
\fIcomment\fR
This is the place for your opaque comments about the user, like realname, mailaddress or such things\&. The server will ignore this field\&.  
 
.SS "Encodings"
 
 
.TP
-d
crypt encryption (default, except on Win32, Netware)  
.TP
-m
MD5 encryption (default on Win32, Netware)  
.TP
-s
SHA1 encryption  
.TP
-p
plaintext (\fInot recommended\fR)  
  
.SS "Commands"
 
 
.TP
add
Adds an entry for \fIusername\fR to \fIfilename\fR using the encrypted password \fIencpasswd\fR\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat add rbowen foKntnEF3KSXA  
.TP
adduser
Asks for a password and then adds an entry for \fIusername\fR to \fIfilename\fR\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat adduser krietz  
.TP
check
Asks for a password and then checks if \fIusername\fR is in \fIfilename\fR and if it's password matches the specified one\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat check rbowen  
.TP
delete
Deletes the \fIusername\fR entry from \fIfilename\fR\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat delete rbowen  
.TP
import
Reads \fIusername\fR:\fIpassword\fR entries (one per line) from STDIN and adds them to \fIfilename\fR\&. The passwords already have to be crypted\&.  
.TP
update
Same as the adduser command, except that it makes sure \fIusername\fR already exists in \fIfilename\fR\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat update rbowen  
.TP
view
Just displays the contents of the DBM file\&. If you specify a \fIusername\fR, it displays the particular record only\&. dbmmanage passwords\&.dat view  
  
.SH "BUGS"
 
.PP
One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file formats in existence, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than one format may exist on your system\&. The three primary examples are SDBM, NDBM, the GNU project's GDBM, and Berkeley DB 2\&. Unfortunately, all these libraries use different file formats, and you must make sure that the file format used by \fIfilename\fR is the same format that dbmmanage expects to see\&. dbmmanage currently has no way of determining what type of DBM file it is looking at\&. If used against the wrong format, will simply return nothing, or may create a different DBM file with a different name, or at worst, it may corrupt the DBM file if you were attempting to write to it\&.
 
.PP
dbmmanage has a list of DBM format preferences, defined by the @AnyDBM::ISA array near the beginning of the program\&. Since we prefer the Berkeley DB 2 file format, the order in which dbmmanage will look for system libraries is Berkeley DB 2, then NDBM, then GDBM and then SDBM\&. The first library found will be the library dbmmanage will attempt to use for all DBM file transactions\&. This ordering is slightly different than the standard @AnyDBM::ISA ordering in Perl, as well as the ordering used by the simple dbmopen() call in Perl, so if you use any other utilities to manage your DBM files, they must also follow this preference ordering\&. Similar care must be taken if using programs in other languages, like C, to access these files\&.
 
.PP
One can usually use the file program supplied with most Unix systems to see what format a DBM file is in\&.

.SH NAME
dc \- an arbitrary precision calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
dc [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help]
   [-e scriptexpression] [--expression=scriptexpression]
   [-f scriptfile] [--file=scriptfile]
   [file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\*(Dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports
unlimited precision arithmetic.
It also allows you to define and call macros.
Normally \*(dc reads from the standard input;
if any command arguments are given to it, they are filenames,
and \*(dc reads and executes the contents of the files before reading
from standard input.
All normal output is to standard output;
all error output is to standard error.
.PP
A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.
Entering a number pushes it on the stack.
Arithmetic operations pop arguments off the stack and push the results.
.PP
To enter a number in
.IR dc ,
type the digits with an optional decimal point.
Exponential notation is not supported.
To enter a negative number,
begin the number with ``_''.
``-'' cannot be used for this,
as it is a binary operator for subtraction instead.
To enter two numbers in succession,
separate them with spaces or newlines.
These have no meaning as commands.
.SH OPTIONS
\*(Dc may be invoked with the following command-line options:
.TP
.B -V
.TP
.B --version
Print out the version of \*(dc that is being run and a copyright notice,
then exit.
.TP
.B -h
.TP
.B --help
Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line options
and the bug-reporting address,
then exit.
.TP
.B -e \fIscript\fP
.TP
.BI --expression= script
Add the commands in
.I script
to the set of commands to be run while processing the input.
.TP
.B -f \fIscript-file\fP
.TP
.BI --file= script-file
Add the commands contained in the file
.I script-file
to the set of commands to be run while processing the input.
.PP
If any command-line parameters remain after processing the above,
these parameters are interpreted as the names of input files to
be processed.
A file name of
.B -
refers to the standard input stream.
The standard input will processed if no file names are specified.
.PD
.SH
Printing Commands
.TP
.B p
Prints the value on the top of the stack,
without altering the stack.
A newline is printed after the value.
.TP
.B n
Prints the value on the top of the stack, popping it off,
and does not print a newline after.
.TP
.B P
Pops off the value on top of the stack.
If it it a string, it is simply printed without a trailing newline.
Otherwise it is a number, and the integer portion of its absolute
value is printed out as a "base (UCHAR_MAX+1)" byte stream.
Assuming that (UCHAR_MAX+1) is 256
(as it is on most machines with 8-bit bytes),
the sequence \fBKSK 0k1/ [_1*]sx d0>x [256~aPd0<x]dsxx sxLKk\fP
could also accomplish this function,
except for the side-effect of clobbering the x register.
.TP
.B f
Prints the entire contents of the stack
.ig
and the contents of all of the registers,
..
without altering anything.
This is a good command to use if you are lost or want
to figure out what the effect of some command has been.
.PD
.SH
Arithmetic
.TP
.B +
Pops two values off the stack, adds them,
and pushes the result.
The precision of the result is determined only
by the values of the arguments,
and is enough to be exact.
.TP
.B -
Pops two values,
subtracts the first one popped from the second one popped,
and pushes the result.
.TP
.B *
Pops two values, multiplies them, and pushes the result.
The number of fraction digits in the result depends on
the current precision value and the number of fraction
digits in the two arguments.
.TP
.B /
Pops two values,
divides the second one popped from the first one popped,
and pushes the result.
The number of fraction digits is specified by the precision value.
.TP
.B %
Pops two values,
computes the remainder of the division that the
.B /
command would do,
and pushes that.
The value computed is the same as that computed by
the sequence \fBSd dld/ Ld*-\fP .
.TP
.B ~
Pops two values,
divides the second one popped from the first one popped.
The quotient is pushed first, and the remainder is pushed next.
The number of fraction digits used in the division
is specified by the precision value.
(The sequence \fBSdSn lnld/ LnLd%\fP could also accomplish
this function, with slightly different error checking.)
.TP
.B ^
Pops two values and exponentiates,
using the first value popped as the exponent
and the second popped as the base.
The fraction part of the exponent is ignored.
The precision value specifies the number of fraction
digits in the result.
.TP
.B |
Pops three values and computes a modular exponentiation.
The first value popped is used as the reduction modulus;
this value must be a non-zero number,
and should be an integer.
The second popped is used as the exponent;
this value must be a non-negative number,
and any fractional part of this exponent will be ignored.
The third value popped is the base which gets exponentiated,
which should be an integer.
For small integers this is like the sequence \fBSm^Lm%\fP,
but, unlike \fB^\fP, this command will work with arbitrarily large exponents.
.TP
.B v
Pops one value,
computes its square root,
and pushes that.
The precision value specifies the number of fraction digits in the result.
.PP
Most arithmetic operations are affected by the ``precision value'',
which you can set with the
.B k
command.
The default precision value is zero,
which means that all arithmetic except for
addition and subtraction produces integer results.
.SH
Stack Control
.TP
.B c
Clears the stack, rendering it empty.
.TP
.B d
Duplicates the value on the top of the stack,
pushing another copy of it.
Thus, ``4d*p'' computes 4 squared and prints it.
.TP
.B r
Reverses the order of (swaps) the top two values on the stack.
.SH
Registers
.PP
\*(Dc provides at least 256 memory registers,
each named by a single character.
You can store a number or a string in a register and retrieve it later.
.TP
.BI s r
Pop the value off the top of the stack and store
it into register
.IR r .
.TP
.BI l r
Copy the value in register
.I r
and push it onto the stack.
This does not alter the contents of
.IR r .
.PP
Each register also contains its own stack.
The current register value is the top of the register's stack.
.TP
.BI S r
Pop the value off the top of the (main) stack and
push it onto the stack of register
.IR r .
The previous value of the register becomes inaccessible.
.TP
.BI L r
Pop the value off the top of register
.IR r 's
stack and push it onto the main stack.
The previous value
in register
.IR r 's
stack, if any,
is now accessible via the
.BI l r
command.
.ig
.PP
The
.B f
command prints a list of all registers that have contents stored in them,
together with their contents.
Only the current contents of each register
(the top of its stack)
is printed.
..
.SH
Parameters
.PP
\*(Dc has three parameters that control its operation:
the precision, the input radix, and the output radix.
The precision specifies the number
of fraction digits to keep in the result of most arithmetic operations.
The input radix controls the interpretation of numbers typed in;
all numbers typed in use this radix.
The output radix is used for printing numbers.
.PP
The input and output radices are separate parameters;
you can make them unequal,
which can be useful or confusing.
The input radix must be between 2 and 16 inclusive.
The output radix must be at least 2.
The precision must be zero or greater.
The precision is always measured in decimal digits,
regardless of the current input or output radix.
.TP
.B i
Pops the value off the top of the stack
and uses it to set the input radix.
.TP
.B o
Pops the value off the top of the stack
and uses it to set the output radix.
.TP
.B k
Pops the value off the top of the stack
and uses it to set the precision.
.TP
.B I
Pushes the current input radix on the stack.
.TP
.B O
Pushes the current output radix on the stack.
.TP
.B K
Pushes the current precision on the stack.
.SH
Strings
.PP
\*(Dc can operate on strings as well as on numbers.
The only things you can do with strings are
print them and execute them as macros
(which means that the contents of the string are processed as
\*(dc commands).
All registers and the stack can hold strings,
and \*(dc always knows whether any given object is a string or a number.
Some commands such as arithmetic operations demand numbers
as arguments and print errors if given strings.
Other commands can accept either a number or a string;
for example, the
.B p
command can accept either and prints the object
according to its type.
.TP
.BI [ characters ]
Makes a string containing
.I characters
(contained between balanced
.B [
and
.B ]
characters),
and pushes it on the stack.
For example,
.B [foo]P
prints the characters
.B foo
(with no newline).
.TP
.B a
The top-of-stack is popped.
If it was a number, then the low-order byte of this number
is converted into a string and pushed onto the stack.
Otherwise the top-of-stack was a string,
and the first character of that string is pushed back.
.TP
.B x
Pops a value off the stack and executes it as a macro.
Normally it should be a string;
if it is a number,
it is simply pushed back onto the stack.
For example,
.B [1p]x
executes the macro
.B 1p
which pushes
.B 1
on the stack and prints
.B 1
on a separate line.
.PP
Macros are most often stored in registers;
.B [1p]sa
stores a macro to print
.B 1
into register
.BR a ,
and
.B lax
invokes this macro.
.TP
.BI > r
Pops two values off the stack and compares them
assuming they are numbers,
executing the contents of register
.I r
as a macro if the original top-of-stack
is greater.
Thus,
.B 1 2>a
will invoke register
.BR a 's
contents and
.B 2 1>a
will not.
.TP
.BI !> r
Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is
not greater than (less than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.
.TP
.BI < r
Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is less.
.TP
.BI !< r
Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is
not less than (greater than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.
.TP
.BI = r
Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are equal.
.TP
.BI != r
Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are not equal.
.ig
This can also be validly used to compare two strings for equality.
..
.TP
.B ?
Reads a line from the terminal and executes it.
This command allows a macro to request input from the user.
.TP
.B q
exits from a macro and also from the macro which invoked it.
If called from the top level,
or from a macro which was called directly from the top level,
the
.B q
command will cause \*(dc to exit.
.TP
.B Q
Pops a value off the stack and uses it as a count
of levels of macro execution to be exited.
Thus,
.B 3Q
exits three levels.
The
.B Q
command will never cause \*(dc to exit.
.SH
Status Inquiry
.TP
.B Z
Pops a value off the stack,
calculates the number of digits it has
(or number of characters, if it is a string)
and pushes that number.
.TP
.B X
Pops a value off the stack,
calculates the number of fraction digits it has,
and pushes that number.
For a string,
the value pushed is
.\" -1.
0.
.TP
.B z
Pushes the current stack depth:
the number of objects on the stack before the execution of the
.B z
command.
.SH
Miscellaneous
.TP
.B !
Will run the rest of the line as a system command.
Note that parsing of the !<, !=, and !> commands take precedence,
so if you want to run a command starting with <, =, or > you will
need to add a space after the !.
.TP
.B #
Will interpret the rest of the line as a comment.
.TP
.BI : r
Will pop the top two values off of the stack.
The old second-to-top value will be stored in the array
.IR r ,
indexed by the old top-of-stack value.
.TP
.BI ; r
Pops the top-of-stack and uses it as an index into
the array
.IR r .
The selected value is then pushed onto the stack.
.P
Note that each stacked instance of a register has its own
array associated with it.
Thus \fB1 0:a 0Sa 2 0:a La 0;ap\fP will print 1,
because the 2 was stored in an instance of 0:a that
was later popped.

.Sh NAME
.Nm dd
.Nd convert and copy a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar operands ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies the standard input to the standard output.
Input data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.
If input reads are short, input from multiple reads are aggregated
to form the output block.
When finished,
.Nm
displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks
and truncated input records to the standard error output.
.Pp
The following operands are available:
.\" XXX
.Bl -tag -width of=file
.It Cm bs Ns = Ns Ar n
Set both input and output block size to
.Ar n
bytes, superseding the
.Cm ibs
and
.Cm obs
operands.
If no conversion values other than
.Cm noerror ,
.Cm notrunc
or
.Cm sync
are specified, then each input block is copied to the output as a
single block without any aggregation of short blocks.
.It Cm cbs Ns = Ns Ar n
Set the conversion record size to
.Ar n
bytes.
The conversion record size is required by the record oriented conversion
values.
.It Cm count Ns = Ns Ar n
Copy only
.Ar n
input blocks.
.It Cm files Ns = Ns Ar n
Copy
.Ar n
input files before terminating.
This operand is only applicable when the input device is a tape.
.It Cm ibs Ns = Ns Ar n
Set the input block size to
.Ar n
bytes instead of the default 512.
.It Cm if Ns = Ns Ar file
Read input from
.Ar file
instead of the standard input.
.It Cm iseek Ns = Ns Ar n
Seek on the input file
.Ar n
blocks.
This is synonymous with
.Cm skip Ns = Ns Ar n .
.It Cm obs Ns = Ns Ar n
Set the output block size to
.Ar n
bytes instead of the default 512.
.It Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file
Write output to
.Ar file
instead of the standard output.
Any regular output file is truncated unless the
.Cm notrunc
conversion value is specified.
If an initial portion of the output file is seeked past (see the
.Cm oseek
operand),
the output file is truncated at that point.
.It Cm oseek Ns = Ns Ar n
Seek on the output file
.Ar n
blocks.
This is synonymous with
.Cm seek Ns = Ns Ar n .
.It Cm seek Ns = Ns Ar n
Seek
.Ar n
blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.
On non-tape devices, an
.Xr lseek 2
operation is used.
Otherwise, existing blocks are read and the data discarded.
If the user does not have read permission for the tape, it is positioned
using the tape
.Xr ioctl 2
function calls.
If the seek operation is past the end of file, space from the current
end of file to the specified offset is filled with blocks of
.Dv NUL
bytes.
.It Cm skip Ns = Ns Ar n
Skip
.Ar n
blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.
On input which supports seeks, an
.Xr lseek 2
operation is used.
Otherwise, input data is read and discarded.
For pipes, the correct number of bytes is read.
For all other devices, the correct number of blocks is read without
distinguishing between a partial or complete block being read.
.It Cm conv Ns = Ns Ar value Ns Op , Ns Ar value ...
Where
.Cm value
is one of the symbols from the following list.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm unblock"
.It Cm ascii , oldascii
The same as the
.Cm unblock
value except that characters are translated from
.Tn EBCDIC
to
.Tn ASCII
before the
records are converted.
(These values imply
.Cm unblock
if the operand
.Cm cbs
is also specified.)
There are two conversion maps for
.Tn ASCII .
The value
.Cm ascii
specifies the recommended one which is compatible with
.At V .
The value
.Cm oldascii
specifies the one used in historic
.At
and
.No pre- Ns Bx 4.3 reno
systems.
.It Cm block
Treats the input as a sequence of newline or end-of-file terminated variable
length records independent of input and output block boundaries.
Any trailing newline character is discarded.
Each input record is converted to a fixed length output record where the
length is specified by the
.Cm cbs
operand.
Input records shorter than the conversion record size are padded with spaces.
Input records longer than the conversion record size are truncated.
The number of truncated input records, if any, are reported to the standard
error output at the completion of the copy.
.It Cm ebcdic , ibm , oldebcdic , oldibm
The same as the
.Cm block
value except that characters are translated from
.Tn ASCII
to
.Tn EBCDIC
after the
records are converted.
(These values imply
.Cm block
if the operand
.Cm cbs
is also specified.)
There are four conversion maps for
.Tn EBCDIC .
The value
.Cm ebcdic
specifies the recommended one which is compatible with
.At V .
The value
.Cm ibm
is a slightly different mapping, which is compatible with the
.At V
.Cm ibm
value.
The values
.Cm oldebcdic
and
.Cm oldibm
are maps used in historic
.At
and
.No pre- Ns Bx 4.3 reno
systems.
.It Cm lcase
Transform uppercase characters into lowercase characters.
.It Cm noerror
Do not stop processing on an input error.
When an input error occurs, a diagnostic message followed by the current
input and output block counts will be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message.
If the
.Cm sync
conversion is also specified, any missing input data will be replaced
with
.Dv NUL
bytes (or with spaces if a block oriented conversion value was
specified) and processed as a normal input buffer.
If the
.Cm sync
conversion is not specified, the input block is omitted from the output.
On input files which are not tapes or pipes, the file offset
will be positioned past the block in which the error occurred using
.Xr lseek 2 .
.It Cm notrunc
Do not truncate the output file.
This will preserve any blocks in the output file not explicitly written
by
.Nm .
The
.Cm notrunc
value is not supported for tapes.
.It Cm osync
Pad the final output block to the full output block size.
If the input file is not a multiple of the output block size
after conversion, this conversion forces the final output block
to be the same size as preceding blocks for use on devices that require
regularly sized blocks to be written.
This option is incompatible with use of the
.Cm bs Ns = Ns Ar n
block size specification.
.It Cm sparse
If one or more output blocks would consist solely of
.Dv NUL
bytes, try to seek the output file by the required space instead of
filling them with
.Dv NUL Ns s ,
resulting in a sparse file.
.It Cm swab
Swap every pair of input bytes.
If an input buffer has an odd number of bytes, the last byte will be
ignored during swapping.
.It Cm sync
Pad every input block to the input buffer size.
Spaces are used for pad bytes if a block oriented conversion value is
specified, otherwise
.Dv NUL
bytes are used.
.It Cm ucase
Transform lowercase characters into uppercase characters.
.It Cm unblock
Treats the input as a sequence of fixed length records independent of input
and output block boundaries.
The length of the input records is specified by the
.Cm cbs
operand.
Any trailing space characters are discarded and a newline character is
appended.
.El
.El
.Pp
Where sizes are specified, a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number of
bytes is expected.
If the number ends with a
.Dq Li b ,
.Dq Li k ,
.Dq Li m ,
.Dq Li g ,
or
.Dq Li w ,
the
number is multiplied by 512, 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), 1073741824 (1G)
or the number of bytes in an integer, respectively.
Two or more numbers may be separated by an
.Dq Li x
to indicate a product.
.Pp
When finished,
.Nm
displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks,
truncated input records and odd-length byte-swapping blocks to the
standard error output.
A partial input block is one where less than the input block size
was read.
A partial output block is one where less than the output block size
was written.
Partial output blocks to tape devices are considered fatal errors.
Otherwise, the rest of the block will be written.
Partial output blocks to character devices will produce a warning message.
A truncated input block is one where a variable length record oriented
conversion value was specified and the input line was too long to
fit in the conversion record or was not newline terminated.
.Pp
Normally, data resulting from input or conversion or both are aggregated
into output blocks of the specified size.
After the end of input is reached, any remaining output is written as
a block.
This means that the final output block may be shorter than the output
block size.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
(see the
.Cm status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 )
signal, the current input and output block counts will
be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message.
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINT
signal, the current input and output block counts will
be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message and
.Nm
will exit.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be a superset of the
.St -p1003.2
standard.
The
.Cm files
operand and the
.Cm ascii ,
.Cm ebcdic ,
.Cm ibm ,
.Cm oldascii ,
.Cm oldebcdic
and
.Cm oldibm
values are extensions to the
\*[Px]
standard.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Defaults
allows users to read, write, and delete Mac OS X user defaults from a command-line shell. Mac OS X applications and other programs use the defaults system to record user preferences and other information that must be maintained when the applications aren't running (such as default font for new documents, or the position of an Info panel). Much of this information is accessible through an application's Preferences panel, but some of it isn't, such as the position of the Info panel. You can access this information with
.Nm
.Pp
.Sy Note:
Since applications do access the defaults system while they're running, you shouldn't modify the defaults of a running application. If you change a default in a domain that belongs to a running application, the application won't see the change and might even overwrite the default.
.Pp
User defaults belong to
.Ar domains ,
which typically correspond to individual applications. Each domain has a dictionary of keys and values representing its defaults; for example, "Default\ Font" = "Helvetica". Keys are always strings, but values can be complex data structures comprising arrays, dictionaries, strings, and binary data. These data structures are stored as XML Property Lists.
.Pp
Though all applications, system services, and other programs have their own domains, they also share a domain named
.Sy NSGlobalDomain .
If a default isn't specified in the application's domain, but is specified in
.Sy NSGlobalDomain ,
then the application uses the value in that domain.
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "read domain"
.It Sy read
Prints all of the user's defaults, for every domain, to standard output.
.It Sy read Ar domain
Prints all of the user's defaults for
.Ar domain
to standard output.
.It Sy read Ar domain key
Prints the value for the default of
.Ar domain
identified by
.Ar key .
.It Sy read-type Ar domain key
Prints the plist type for the given
.Ar domain
identified by
.Ar key .
.It Sy write Ar domain key 'value'
Writes
.Ar value
as the value for
.Ar key
in
.Ar domain .
.Ar value
must be a property list, and must be enclosed in single quotes.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults write com.companyname.appname "Default Color" '(255, 0, 0)'
.Ed
.Pp
sets the value for Default Color to an array containing the strings 255, 0, 0 (the red, green, and blue components). Note that the key is enclosed in quotation marks because it contains a space.
.It Sy write Ar domain 'plist'
Overwrites the defaults information in
.Ar domain
with that given as
.Ar plist .
.Ar plist
must be a property list representation of a dictionary, and must be enclosed in single quotes.
For example: 
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults write com.companyname.appname '{ "Default Color" = (255, 0, 0);
				"Default Font" = Helvetica; }';
.Ed
.Pp
erases any previous defaults for com.companyname.appname and writes the values for the two names into the defaults system.
.It Sy delete Ar domain
Removes all default information for
.Ar domain .
.It Sy delete Ar domain key
Removes the default named
.Ar key
from
.Ar domain .
.It Sy domains
Prints the names of all domains in the user's defaults system.
.TP
.It Sy find Ar word
Searches for
.Ar word
in the domain names, keys, and values of the user's defaults, and prints out a list of matches.
.It Sy help
Prints a list of possible command formats.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
\fBSpecifying domains:\fR
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "filepath"
.It Ar domain
If no flag is specified, \fIdomain\fR is a domain name of the form com.companyname.appname.
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults read com.apple.TextEdit
.Ed
.It Fl app Ar application
The name of an application may be provided instead of a domain using the \fB-app\fR flag. Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults read -app TextEdit
.Ed
.It Ar filepath
Domains may also be specified as a path to an arbitrary plist file, with or without the '.plist' extension. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults read ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist
.Ed
.Pp
normally gives the same result as the two previous examples.
In the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults write ~/Desktop/TestFile foo bar
.Ed
.Pp
will write the key 'foo' with the value 'bar' into the plist file 'TestFile.plist' that is on the user's desktop. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, the key-value pair will be added, overwriting the value of 'foo' if it already existed.
.Pp
WARNING: The defaults command will be changed in an upcoming major release to only operate on preferences domains. General plist manipulation utilities will be folded into a different command-line program.
.It Fl g | globalDomain | Sy NSGlobalDomain
Specify the global domain. '\fB-g\fR' and '\fB-globalDomain\fR' may be used as synonyms for 
.Sy NSGlobalDomain .
.El
.Pp
\fBSpecifying value types for preference keys:\fR
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-int[eger]"  
.It " "
If no type flag is provided,
.Nm
will assume the value is a string. For best results, use one of the type flags, listed below. 
.It Fl string
Allows the user to specify a string as the value for the given preference key.
.It Fl data
Allows the user to specify a bunch of raw data bytes as the value for the given preference key. 
The data must be provided in hexidecimal.
.It Fl int[eger]
Allows the user to specify an integer as the value for the given preference key.
.It Fl float
Allows the user to specify a floating point number as the value for the given preference key.
.It Fl bool[ean]
Allows the user to specify a boolean as the value for the given preference key.
Value must be TRUE, FALSE, YES, or NO.
.It Fl date
Allows the user to specify a date as the value for the given preference key.
.It Fl array
Allows the user to specify an array as the value for the given preference key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults write somedomain preferenceKey -array element1 element2 element3
.Ed
.Pp
The specified array overwrites the value of the key if the key was present at the time of the write. If the key was not present, it is created with the new value.
.Pp
.It Fl array-add
Allows the user to add new elements to the end of an array for a key which has an array as its value. Usage is the same as -array above. If the key was not present, it is created with the specified array as its value.
.Pp
.It Fl dict
Allows the user to add a dictionary to the defaults database for a domain.  Keys and values are specified in order:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
defaults write somedomain preferenceKey -dict key1 value1 key2 value2
.Ed
.Pp
The specified dictionary overwrites the value of the key if the key was present at the time of the write. If the key was not present, it is created with the new value.
.Pp
.It Fl dict-add
Allows the user to add new key/value pairs to a dictionary for a key which has a dictionary as its value. Usage is the same as -dict above. If the key was not present, it is created with the specified dictionary as its value.
.El
.Pp
\fBSpecifying a host for preferences:\fR
.Pp
Operations on the defaults database normally apply to any host the user may log in on, but may be restricted to apply only to a specific host. 
.Bl -tag -width   
.It " "
If no host is provided, preferences operations will apply to any host the user may log in on.
.It Fl currentHost
Restricts preferences operations to the host the user is currently logged in on.
.It Fl host Ar hostname
Restricts preferences operations to \fIhostname\fR.
.El
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
Defaults can be structured in very complex ways, making it difficult for the user to enter them with this command.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df

.Oc
.Op Fl ailn
.Op Fl t

.Oo
.Fl b | h | H | k |
.Fl m | P
.Oc
.Op Fl ailn
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Op Fl T Ar type
.Op Ar file | filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm df
utility
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block counts.
If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl t
option below).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the MNT_IGNORE
flag.
.It Fl b
Use (the default) 512-byte blocks.
This is only useful as a way to override an
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl g
Use 1073741824-byte (1-Gbyte) blocks rather than the default.
Note that this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl H
"Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to three or less using base 10 for sizes.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes. This option is now the default to conform to
.St -susv3
Use
.Fl P
to suppress this output.
.It Fl k
Use 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks, rather than the default.
Note that this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl l
Only display information about locally-mounted filesystems.
.It Fl m
Use 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks rather than the default.  Note that
this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl P
Use (the default) 512-byte blocks.
This is only useful as a way to override an
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl T
Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
For example, the
.Nm df
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
df -T nonfs,mfs
.Ed
.Pp
lists all filesystems except those of type
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MFS .
The
.Xr lsvfs 1
command can be used to find out the types of filesystems
that are available on the system.
.It Fl t
If used with no arguments,
this option is a no-op
(Mac OS X already prints the total allocated-space figures).
If used with an argument, it acts like
.Fl T ,
but this usage is deprecated and should not be relied upon.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, the block counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl n
and
.Fl t
flags are ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
The "capacity" percentage is normally rounded up to the next higher integer.
In legacy mode, it is rounded down to the next lower integer.
.Pp
When the
.Fl P
option and the
.Fl k
option are used together,
sizes are reported in 1024-blocks.
In legacy mode, when the
.Fl P
option and
.Fl k
option are used together,
the last option specified dictates the reported block size.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option is normally a no-op
(Mac OS X already prints the total allocated-space figures).
In legacy mode, it is equivalent to
.Fl T .
.Pp

This command is used to manipulate \s-1DH\s0 parameter files.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded
form compatible with the PKCS#3 DHparameter structure. The \s-1PEM\s0 form is the
default format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64 encoded with
additional header and footer lines.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or standard input if
this option is not specified.
.IP "\fB\-out\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename parameters to. Standard output is used
if this option is not present. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same
as the input filename.
.IP "\fB\-dsaparam\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dsaparam"
If this option is used, \s-1DSA\s0 rather than \s-1DH\s0 parameters are read or created;
they are converted to \s-1DH\s0 format.  Otherwise, \*(L"strong\*(R" primes (such
that (p\-1)/2 is also prime) will be used for \s-1DH\s0 parameter generation.
.Sp
\&\s-1DH\s0 parameter generation with the \fB\-dsaparam\fR option is much faster,
and the recommended exponent length is shorter, which makes \s-1DH\s0 key
exchange more efficient.  Beware that with such DSA-style \s-1DH\s0
parameters, a fresh \s-1DH\s0 key should be created for each use to
avoid small-subgroup attacks that may be possible otherwise.
.IP "\fB\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-check"
check if the parameters are valid primes and generator.
.IP "\fB\-2\fR, \fB\-5\fR" 4
.IX Item "-2, -5"
The generator to use, either 2 or 5. 2 is the default. If present then the
input file is ignored and parameters are generated instead.
.IP "\fB\-rand\fR \fIfile(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.IP "\fInumbits\fR" 4
.IX Item "numbits"
this option specifies that a parameter set should be generated of size
\&\fInumbits\fR. It must be the last option. If not present then a value of 512
is used. If this option is present then the input file is ignored and 
parameters are generated instead.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option inhibits the output of the encoded version of the parameters.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
this option prints out the \s-1DH\s0 parameters in human readable form.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
this option converts the parameters into C code. The parameters can then
be loaded by calling the \fBget_dh\fR\fInumbits\fR\fB()\fR function.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

.SH NAME
\fBdiffstat\fP \- make histogram from diff-output
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdiffstat\fP\fI [options] [file-specifications]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads the output of \fBdiff\fP and displays a histogram
of the insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file.
Diffstat is a program that is useful for reviewing large, complex patch files.
It reads from one or more input files which contain output from \fBdiff\fP,
producing a histogram of the total lines changed for each file referenced.
.PP
If the input filename ends with .bz2, .gz, .lzma, .z or .Z,
diffstat will read the
uncompressed data via a pipe from the corresponding program.
It also can infer the compression type from files piped via the standard input.
.PP
Diffstat recognizes the most popular types of output from diff:
.RS
.TP
unified
preferred by the \fBpatch\fP utility.
.TP
context
best for readability, but not very compact.
.TP
default
not good for much, but simple to generate.
.RE
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP detects the lines that are output by \fBdiff\fP to
tell which files are compared, and then counts the markers in the
first column that denote the type of change (insertion, deletion
or modification).
These are shown in the histogram as "+", "\-" and "!" characters.
.PP
If no filename is given on the command line,
\fBdiffstat\fP reads the differences from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
ignore lines matching "Binary files XXX and YYY differ" in the diff
.TP
.B \-c
prefix each line of output with "#", making it a comment-line for shell
scripts.
.TP
.B \-C
add SGR color escape sequences to highlight the histogram.
.TP
.BI \-D " destination"
specify a directory containing files which can be referred to as
the result of applying the differences.
\fBdiffstat\fP will count the lines in the corresponding files
(after adjusting the names by the \fB\-p\fP option)
to obtain the total number of lines in each file.
.IP
The remainder, after subtracting modified and deleted lines,
is shown as "unchanged lines".
.TP
.BI \-e " file"
redirect standard error to \fIfile\fR.
.TP
.BI \-f " format"
specify the format of the histogram.
.RS
.TP 3
0
for concise, which shows only the value and a single histogram code for each of
insert (+),
delete (\-) or
modify (!)
.TP 3
1
for normal output,
.TP 3
2
to fill in the histogram with dots,
.TP 3
4
to print each value with the histogram.
.RE
.IP
Any nonzero value gives a histogram.
The dots and individual values can be combined,
e.g., \fB\-f6\fP gives both.
.TP
.B \-h
prints the usage message and exits.
.TP
.B \-k
suppress the merging of filenames in the report.
.TP
.B \-l
lists only the filenames.
No histogram is generated.
.TP
.B \-m
merge insert/delete counts from each "chunk" of the patch file to
approximate a count of the modified lines.
.TP
.BI \-n " number"
specify the minimum width used for filenames.
If you do not specify this, \fBdiffstat\fP uses the length of the longest
filename, after stripping common prefixes.
.TP
.BI \-N " number"
specify the maximum width used for filenames.
Names longer than this limit are truncated on the left.
If you do not specify this, \fBdiffstat\fP next checks the \fB\-n\fP option.
.TP
.BI \-o " file"
redirect standard output to \fIfile\fR.
.TP
.BI \-p " number"
override the logic that strips common pathnames, simulating the \fBpatch\fP
"\-p" option.
.TP
.B \-q
suppress the "0 files changed" message for empty diffs.
.TP
.B \-r " code"
provides optional rounding of the data shown in histogram,
rather than truncating with error adjustments.
.RS
.TP 3
0
is the default.
No rounding is performed,
but accumulated errors are added to following columns.
.TP 3
1
rounds the data
.TP 3
2
rounds the data and adjusts the histogram to ensure that
it displays something if there are any differences even if
those would normally be rounded to zero.
.RE
.TP
.B \-R
Assume patch was created with old and new files swapped.
.TP
.BI \-s
show only the summary line, e.g., number of insertions and deletions.
.TP
.BI \-S " source"
this is like the \fB\-D\fP option, but specifies a location where
the original files (before applying differences) can be found.
.TP
.B \-t
overrides the histogram,
generates output of comma separated values.
.TP
.B \-u
suppress the sorting of filenames in the report.
.TP
.B \-v
show progress,
e.g., if the output is redirected to a file,
write progress messages to the standard error.
.TP
.B \-V
prints the current version number and exits.
.TP
.BI \-w " number"
specify the maximum width of the histogram.
The histogram will never be shorter than 10 columns,
just in case the filenames get too large.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP runs in a portable UNIX\*R environment.
.PP
You can override the compiled-in paths of programs used for decompressing
input files by setting environment variables corresponding to their name:
.sp
.RS
.nf
DIFFSTAT_BZCAT_PATH
DIFFSTAT_BZIP2_PATH
DIFFSTAT_COMPRESS_PATH
DIFFSTAT_GZIP_PATH
DIFFSTAT_LZCAT_PATH
DIFFSTAT_PCAT_PATH
DIFFSTAT_UNCOMPRESS_PATH
DIFFSTAT_XZ_PATH
DIFFSTAT_ZCAT_PATH
.fi
.RE
.PP
However, \fBdiffstat\fP assumes that the resulting program uses the
same command-line options, e.g., "\-c" to decompress to the standard output.
.SH FILES
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP is a single binary module, which uses no auxiliary files.
.SH BUGS
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP makes a lot of assumptions about the format of a \fBdiff\fP file.
.PP
There is no way to obtain a filename from the standard diff between
two files with no options.
Context diffs work,
as well as unified diffs.
.PP
There's no easy way to determine the degree of overlap between the
"before" and "after" displays of modified lines.
\fBdiffstat\fP simply counts the number of inserted and deleted lines
to approximate modified lines for the \fB\-m\fP option.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdig\fR
(domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use
\fBdig\fR
to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than
\fBdig\fR.
.PP
Although
\fBdig\fR
is normally used with command\-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command\-line arguments and options is printed when the
\fB\-h\fR
option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementation of
\fBdig\fR
allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line.
.PP
Unless it is told to query a specific name server,
\fBdig\fR
will try each of the servers listed in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR.
.PP
When no command line arguments or options are given,
\fBdig\fR
will perform an NS query for "." (the root).
.PP
It is possible to set per\-user defaults for
\fBdig\fR
via
\fI${HOME}/.digrc\fR. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command line arguments.
.PP
The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domains names. Either use the
\fB\-t\fR
and
\fB\-c\fR
options to specify the type and class, use the
\fB\-q\fR
the specify the domain name, or use "IN." and "CH." when looking up these top level domains.
.SH "SIMPLE USAGE"
.PP
A typical invocation of
\fBdig\fR
looks like:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
 dig @server name type 
.fi
.RE
.sp
where:
.PP
\fBserver\fR
.RS 4
is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon\-delimited notation. When the supplied
\fIserver\fR
argument is a hostname,
\fBdig\fR
resolves that name before querying that name server. If no
\fIserver\fR
argument is provided,
\fBdig\fR
consults
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR
and queries the name servers listed there. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.
.RE
.PP
\fBname\fR
.RS 4
is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.
.RE
.PP
\fBtype\fR
.RS 4
indicates what type of query is required \(em ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.
\fItype\fR
can be any valid query type. If no
\fItype\fR
argument is supplied,
\fBdig\fR
will perform a lookup for an A record.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fB\-b\fR
option sets the source IP address of the query to
\fIaddress\fR. This must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::". An optional port may be specified by appending "#<port>"
.PP
The default query class (IN for internet) is overridden by the
\fB\-c\fR
option.
\fIclass\fR
is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records.
.PP
The
\fB\-f\fR
option makes
\fBdig \fR
operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from the file
\fIfilename\fR. The file contains a number of queries, one per line. Each entry in the file should be organized in the same way they would be presented as queries to
\fBdig\fR
using the command\-line interface.
.PP
The
\fB\-m\fR
option enables memory usage debugging.
.PP
If a non\-standard port number is to be queried, the
\fB\-p\fR
option is used.
\fIport#\fR
is the port number that
\fBdig\fR
will send its queries instead of the standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non\-standard port number.
.PP
The
\fB\-4\fR
option forces
\fBdig\fR
to only use IPv4 query transport. The
\fB\-6\fR
option forces
\fBdig\fR
to only use IPv6 query transport.
.PP
The
\fB\-t\fR
option sets the query type to
\fItype\fR. It can be any valid query type which is supported in BIND 9. The default query type is "A", unless the
\fB\-x\fR
option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required,
\fItype\fR
is set to
ixfr=N. The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was
\fIN\fR.
.PP
The
\fB\-q\fR
option sets the query name to
\fIname\fR. This useful do distinguish the
\fIname\fR
from other arguments.
.PP
Reverse lookups \(em mapping addresses to names \(em are simplified by the
\fB\-x\fR
option.
\fIaddr\fR
is an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation, or a colon\-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need to provide the
\fIname\fR,
\fIclass\fR
and
\fItype\fR
arguments.
\fBdig\fR
automatically performs a lookup for a name like
11.12.13.10.in\-addr.arpa
and sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886 method using the IP6.INT domain specify the
\fB\-i\fR
option. Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not attempted.
.PP
To sign the DNS queries sent by
\fBdig\fR
and their responses using transaction signatures (TSIG), specify a TSIG key file using the
\fB\-k\fR
option. You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the
\fB\-y\fR
option;
\fIhmac\fR
is the type of the TSIG, default HMAC\-MD5,
\fIname\fR
is the name of the TSIG key and
\fIkey\fR
is the actual key. The key is a base\-64 encoded string, typically generated by
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR(8). Caution should be taken when using the
\fB\-y\fR
option on multi\-user systems as the key can be visible in the output from
\fBps\fR(1)
or in the shell's history file. When using TSIG authentication with
\fBdig\fR, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate
\fBkey\fR
and
\fBserver\fR
statements in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.SH "Mac OS X NOTICE"
The
\fBdig\fR
command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac OS X.
The results of name or address queries printed by
\fBdig\fR
may differ from those found by other processes that use the Mac OS X native name and address resolution mechanisms.
The results of DNS queries may also differ from queries that use the Mac OS X DNS routing library.
.SH "QUERY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdig\fR
provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies.
.PP
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the string
no
to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
\fB+keyword=value\fR. The query options are:
.PP
\fB+[no]tcp\fR
.RS 4
Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The default behavior is to use UDP unless an AXFR or IXFR query is requested, in which case a TCP connection is used.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]vc\fR
.RS 4
Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate syntax to
\fI+[no]tcp\fR
is provided for backwards compatibility. The "vc" stands for "virtual circuit".
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]ignore\fR
.RS 4
Ignore truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP. By default, TCP retries are performed.
.RE
.PP
\fB+domain=somename\fR
.RS 4
Set the search list to contain the single domain
\fIsomename\fR, as if specified in a
\fBdomain\fR
directive in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR, and enable search list processing as if the
\fI+search\fR
option were given.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]search\fR
.RS 4
Use [do not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or domain directive in
\fIresolv.conf\fR
(if any). The search list is not used by default.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]showsearch\fR
.RS 4
Perform [do not perform] a search showing intermediate results.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]defname\fR
.RS 4
Deprecated, treated as a synonym for
\fI+[no]search\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]aaonly\fR
.RS 4
Sets the "aa" flag in the query.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]aaflag\fR
.RS 4
A synonym for
\fI+[no]aaonly\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]adflag\fR
.RS 4
Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query. This requests the server to return whether all of the answer and authority sections have all been validated as secure according to the security policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records have been validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT\-OUT range. AD=0 indicate that some part of the answer was insecure or not validated.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cdflag\fR
.RS 4
Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cl\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the record.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]ttlid\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the TTL when printing the record.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]recurse\fR
.RS 4
Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query. This bit is set by default, which means
\fBdig\fR
normally sends recursive queries. Recursion is automatically disabled when the
\fI+nssearch\fR
or
\fI+trace\fR
query options are used.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]nssearch\fR
.RS 4
When this option is set,
\fBdig\fR
attempts to find the authoritative name servers for the zone containing the name being looked up and display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]trace\fR
.RS 4
Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When tracing is enabled,
\fBdig\fR
makes iterative queries to resolve the name being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers, showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the lookup.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cmd\fR
.RS 4
Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output identifying the version of
\fBdig\fR
and the query options that have been applied. This comment is printed by default.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]short\fR
.RS 4
Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the answer in a verbose form.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]identify\fR
.RS 4
Show [or do not show] the IP address and port number that supplied the answer when the
\fI+short\fR
option is enabled. If short form answers are requested, the default is not to show the source address and port number of the server that provided the answer.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]comments\fR
.RS 4
Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The default is to print comments.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]stats\fR
.RS 4
This query option toggles the printing of statistics: when the query was made, the size of the reply and so on. The default behavior is to print the query statistics.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]qr\fR
.RS 4
Print [do not print] the query as it is sent. By default, the query is not printed.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]question\fR
.RS 4
Print [do not print] the question section of a query when an answer is returned. The default is to print the question section as a comment.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]answer\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply. The default is to display it.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]authority\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the authority section of a reply. The default is to display it.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]additional\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the additional section of a reply. The default is to display it.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]all\fR
.RS 4
Set or clear all display flags.
.RE
.PP
\fB+time=T\fR
.RS 4
Sets the timeout for a query to
\fIT\fR
seconds. The default timeout is 5 seconds. An attempt to set
\fIT\fR
to less than 1 will result in a query timeout of 1 second being applied.
.RE
.PP
\fB+tries=T\fR
.RS 4
Sets the number of times to try UDP queries to server to
\fIT\fR
instead of the default, 3. If
\fIT\fR
is less than or equal to zero, the number of tries is silently rounded up to 1.
.RE
.PP
\fB+retry=T\fR
.RS 4
Sets the number of times to retry UDP queries to server to
\fIT\fR
instead of the default, 2. Unlike
\fI+tries\fR, this does not include the initial query.
.RE
.PP
\fB+ndots=D\fR
.RS 4
Set the number of dots that have to appear in
\fIname\fR
to
\fID\fR
for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the
\fBsearch\fR
or
\fBdomain\fR
directive in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB+bufsize=B\fR
.RS 4
Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to
\fIB\fR
bytes. The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0 respectively. Values outside this range are rounded up or down appropriately. Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be sent.
.RE
.PP
\fB+edns=#\fR
.RS 4
Specify the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255. Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent.
\fB+noedns\fR
clears the remembered EDNS version.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]multiline\fR
.RS 4
Print records like the SOA records in a verbose multi\-line format with human\-readable comments. The default is to print each record on a single line, to facilitate machine parsing of the
\fBdig\fR
output.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]onesoa\fR
.RS 4
Print only one (starting) SOA record when performing an AXFR. The default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]fail\fR
.RS 4
Do not try the next server if you receive a SERVFAIL. The default is to not try the next server which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]besteffort\fR
.RS 4
Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed. The default is to not display malformed answers.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]dnssec\fR
.RS 4
Requests DNSSEC records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK bit (DO) in the OPT record in the additional section of the query.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]sigchase\fR
.RS 4
Chase DNSSEC signature chains. Requires dig be compiled with \-DDIG_SIGCHASE.
.RE
.PP
\fB+trusted\-key=####\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a file containing trusted keys to be used with
\fB+sigchase\fR. Each DNSKEY record must be on its own line.
.sp
If not specified,
\fBdig\fR
will look for
\fI/etc/trusted\-key.key\fR
then
\fItrusted\-key.key\fR
in the current directory.
.sp
Requires dig be compiled with \-DDIG_SIGCHASE.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
When chasing DNSSEC signature chains perform a top\-down validation. Requires dig be compiled with \-DDIG_SIGCHASE.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]nsid\fR
.RS 4
Include an EDNS name server ID request when sending a query.
.RE
.SH "MULTIPLE QUERIES"
.PP
The BIND 9 implementation of
\fBdig \fR
supports specifying multiple queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the
\fB\-f\fR
batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of flags, options and query options.
.PP
In this case, each
\fIquery\fR
argument represent an individual query in the command\-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query type and class and any query options that should be applied to that query.
.PP
A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied on the command line. Any global query options (except the
\fB+[no]cmd\fR
option) can be overridden by a query\-specific set of query options. For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
dig +qr www.isc.org any \-x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr
.fi
.RE
.sp
shows how
\fBdig\fR
could be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query for
www.isc.org, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1 and a query for the NS records of
isc.org. A global query option of
\fI+qr\fR
is applied, so that
\fBdig\fR
shows the initial query it made for each lookup. The final query has a local query option of
\fI+noqr\fR
which means that
\fBdig\fR
will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for
isc.org.
.SH "IDN SUPPORT"
.PP
If
\fBdig\fR
has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non\-ASCII domain names.
\fBdig\fR
appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the
\fBIDN_DISABLE\fR
environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when
\fBdig\fR
runs.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The dispatcher queue length is an indication of CPU saturation.
It is not an indicatior of utilisation - the CPUs may or may not be
utilised when the dispatcher queue reports a length of zero.

This script measures this activity by sampling at 1000 Hertz per CPU.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.Fl Fl help
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In its first form, 
.Nm
copies one or more source files or directories to a destination
directory.  If the destination directory does not exist it will be
created before the first source is copied.  If the destination
directory already exists then the source directories are merged
with the previous contents of the destination.
.Pp
In its second form, 
.Nm
copies a file to the supplied 
.Ar dst_file
pathname.
.Pp
The next two forms reflect
.Nm Ns 's
ability to create and extract
archives.  These archives can be either CPIO format (preferred for unix 
content) or PKZip (for Windows compatibility).
.Ar src_archive
(and
.Ns Ar dst_archive )
can be the single character '-', causing ditto to read (write) archive data
from stdin (or to stdout, respectively).
.Pp
.Nm
follows symbolic links provided as arguments but does not follow any links
as it traverses the source or destination hierarchies.
.Nm
overwrites existing files, symbolic links, and devices in the destination
when these are copied from a source.  The resulting files, links, and
devices will have the same mode, access time, modification time, owner,
and group as the source items from which they are copied.  Pipes, sockets,
and files with names beginning with .nfs or .afpDeleted will be ignored.
.Nm
does not modify the mode, owner, group, extended attributes, or ACLs of existing
directories in the
destination.  Files and symbolic links cannot overwrite directories or
vice-versa.
.Pp
.Nm 
can be used to "thin" Universal Mach-O binaries during a copy. 
.Nm
can also copy files selectively based on the contents of a BOM
("Bill of Materials") file.
.Nm
preserves file hard links (but not directory hard links) present in the source directories and preserves
setuid and setgid modes when run as the superuser. 
.Pp
.Nm
will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information
when copying unless instructed otherwise using
.Fl Fl norsrc
\&.
Similarly,
.Nm
will preserve extended attributes and Access Control Lists (ACLs) unless
.Fl Fl noextattr
or
.Fl Fl noacl
is passed.
.Ev DITTONORSRC
can be set in the environment as an alias to
.Fl Fl norsrc 
.Fl Fl noextattr 
.Fl Fl noacl
on the command line.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "XXkeepParent"
.It Fl h
Print full usage.
.It Fl v
Print a line of output to stderr for each source directory copied.
.It Fl V
Print a line of output to stderr for every file, symbolic link, and device copied.
.It Fl X
When copying one or more source directories, do not descend into directories
that have a different device ID.
.It Fl c
Create an archive at the destination path.  The default format is CPIO, unless
.Fl k
is given.
CPIO archives should be stored in files with names ending in .cpio.
Compressed CPIO archives should be stored in files with names ending in
\&.cpgz.
.It Fl z
Create compressed CPIO archives, using
.Xr gzip 1
compression.
.It Fl j
Create compressed CPIO archives, using
.Xr bzip2 1
compression.
.It Fl x
Extract the archives given as source arguments. The format is assumed to
be CPIO, unless
.Fl k
is given.  Compressed CPIO is automatically handled.
.It Fl k
Create or extract from a PKZip archive instead of the default CPIO.
PKZip archives should be stored in filenames ending in .zip.
.It Fl Fl keepParent
When creating an archive, embed the parent directory name
.Ar src
in
.Ar dst_archive Ns .
.It Fl Fl arch Ar arch
Thin Universal binaries to the specified
architecture.  If multiple
.Fl Fl arch
options are specified then the resulting destination file will contain
each of the specified architectures (if they are present in the source
file).
.Ar arch
should be specified as "i386", "x86_64", etc.
.It Fl Fl bom Ar bom
Copy only files, links, devices, and directories that are present in the
specified BOM.
.It Fl Fl rsrc
Preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.
.Nm
will store this data in Carbon-compatible ._ AppleDouble files on
filesystems that do not natively support resource forks.  As of Mac OS X 10.4,
.Fl Fl rsrc
is default behavior.
.It Fl Fl norsrc
Do not preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.  If both
.Fl Fl norsrc
and
.Fl Fl rsrc
are passed, whichever is passed last will take precedence.  Both options
override
.Ev DITTONORSRC Ns . Unless explicitly specified,
.Fl Fl norsrc
also implies
.Fl Fl noextattr
and
.Fl Fl noacl
to match the behavior of Mac OS X 10.4.
.It Fl Fl extattr
Preserve extended attributes (requires
.Fl Fl rsrc Ns ).
As of Mac OS X 10.5,
.Fl Fl extattr
is the default.
.It Fl Fl noextattr
Do not preserve extended attributes (requires 
.Fl Fl norsrc  Ns ).
.It Fl Fl qtn
Preserve quarantine information.
As of Mac OS X 10.5,
.Fl Fl qtn
is the default.
.It Fl Fl noqtn
Do not preserve quarantine information.
.It Fl Fl acl
Preserve Access Control Lists (ACLs).
As of Mac OS X 10.5,
.Fl Fl acl
is the default.
.It Fl Fl noacl
Do not preserve ACLs.
.It Fl Fl nocache
Do not perform copies using the Mac OS X Unified Buffer Cache. Files read
and written will not be cached, although if the file is already present
in the cache, the cached information will be used.
.It Fl Fl hfsCompression
When copying files or extracting content from an archive, if the destination 
is an HFS+ volume that supports compression, all the content will be compressed
if appropriate. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, and is only
intended to be used in installation and backup scenarios that involve system 
files. Since files using HFS+ compression are not readable on versions of 
Mac OS X earlier than 10.6, this flag should not be used when dealing with
non-system files or other user-generated content that will be used on a 
version of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6. 
.It Fl Fl nohfsCompression
Do not compress files with HFS+ compression when copying or extracting content
from an archive unless the content is already compressed with HFS+ compression. 
This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later. 
.Fl Fl nohfsCompression
is the default.
.It Fl Fl preserveHFSCompression
When copying files to an HFS+ volume that supports compression, ditto will 
preserve the compression of any source files that were using HFS+ compression. 
This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later. 
.Fl Fl preserveHFSCompression
is the default.
.It Fl Fl nopreserveHFSCompression
Do not preserve HFS+ compression when copying files that are already compressed with
HFS+ compression. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.
.It Fl Fl sequesterRsrc
When creating a PKZip archive, preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data
in the subdirectory __MACOSX.  PKZip extraction will automatically find
these resources.
.It Fl Fl zlibCompressionLevel Ar num
Sets the compression level to use when creating a PKZip archive. The compression
level can be set from 0 to 9, where 0 represents no compression, and 9 
represents optimal (slowest) compression. By default, ditto will use the default compression
level as defined by zlib.
.It Fl Fl password
When extracting a password-encrypted ZIP archive, you must specify --password to allow ditto 
to prompt for a password to use to extract the contents of the file. If this option is not 
provided, and a password-encrypted file is encountered, ditto will emit an error message.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Dl ditto src_directory dst_directory
copies the contents of src_directory into dst_directory, creating
dst_directory if it does not already exist.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl ditto src_directory dir/dst_directory
copies the contents of src_directory into dir/dst_directory, creating
dir and dst_directory if they don't already exist.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl ditto src-1 ... src-n dst_directory
copies the contents of all of the src directories into dst_directory,
creating dst_directory if it does not already exist.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl ditto --arch ppc universal_file thin_file
copies the contents of universal_file into thin_file, thinning executable
code to ppc-only on the fly.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl ditto -c --norsrc Scripts -|ssh rhost ditto -x --norsrc - ./Scripts
copies Scripts, skipping any resources or meta-data, to rhost.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl pax -f archive.cpio
will list the files in the CPIO archive archive.cpio.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl pax -zf archive.cpgz
will list the files in the compressed CPIO archive archive.cpgz.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent src_directory archive.zip
will create a PKZip archive similarly to the Finder's Compress functionality.
.Pp
The command:
.Dl unzip -l archive.zip
will list the files in the PKZip archive archive.zip.
.Sh "ERRORS"
.Nm 
returns 0 if everything is copied, otherwise non-zero.
.Nm
almost never gives up, preferring to report errors along the way.
Diagnostic messages will be printed to standard error.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width DITTOABORT
.It Ev DITTOABORT
If the environment variable
.Ev DITTOABORT
is set,
.Nm
will call
.Xr abort 3
if it encounters a fatal error.
.It Ev DITTONORSRC
If
.Ev DITTONORSRC
is set but
.Fl Fl rsrc Ns ,
.Fl Fl extattr Ns ,
and
.Fl Fl acl 
are not specified,
.Nm
will not preserve those additional types of metadata.
.El
.Sh "BUGS"
.Nm 
doesn't copy directories into directories in the same way as
.Xr cp 1 Ns .
In particular,
.Dl ditto foo bar
will copy the contents of foo into bar, whereas 
.Dl cp -r foo bar
copies foo itself into bar. Though this is not a bug, some may
consider this bug-like behavior.
.Fl Fl keepParent
for non-archive copies will eventually alleviate this problem.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is a network diagnostic tool, much like
.Xr ping 8
or
.Xr traceroute 8 .
However, unlike those tools, most of its functionality is not implemented in the
.Nm
executable itself, but in library code that is available to any application.
The library API that
.Nm
uses is documented in
.Pa /usr/include/dns_sd.h .
The
.Nm
command replaces the older
mDNS
command.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is primarily intended for interactive use.
Because its command-line arguments and output format are subject to change,
invoking it from a shell script will generally be fragile. Additionally,
the asynchronous nature of DNS Service Discovery does
not lend itself easily to script-oriented programming. For example,
calls like "browse" never complete; the action of performing a "browse"
sets in motion machinery to notify the client whenever instances of
that service type appear or disappear from the network. These
notifications continue to be delivered indefinitely, for minutes,
hours, or even days, as services come and go, until the client
explicitly terminates the call. This style of asynchronous interaction
works best with applications that are either multi-threaded, or use a
main event-handling loop to receive keystrokes, network data, and other
asynchronous event notifications as they happen.
.br
If you wish to perform DNS Service Discovery operations from a
scripting language, then the best way to do this is not to execute the
.Nm
command and then attempt to decipher the textual output, but instead to
directly call the DNS-SD APIs using a binding for your chosen language.
.br
For example, if you are programming in Ruby, then you can
directly call DNS-SD APIs using the dnssd package documented at
.Pa <http://rubyforge.org/projects/dnssd/> .
.br
Similar bindings for other languages are also in development.

return a list of domains recommended for registering(advertising) services.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl F
return a list of domains recommended for browsing services.
.Pp
Normally, on your home network, the only domain you are likely to see is "local". 
However if your network administrator has created Domain Enumeration records, 
then you may also see other recommended domains for registering and browsing.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl R Ar name type domain port Op Ar key=value ...
register (advertise) a service in the specified
.Ar domain 
with the given
.Ar name
and
.Ar type
as listening (on the current machine) on
.Ar port.
.Pp
.Ar name
can be arbitrary unicode text, containing any legal unicode characters
(including dots, spaces, slashes, colons, etc. without restriction),
up to 63 UTF-8 bytes long.
.Ar type
must be of the form "_app-proto._tcp" or "_app-proto._udp", where
"app-proto" is an application protocol name registered at
.Pa http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml .
.Pp
.Ar domain
is the domain in which to register the service.
In current implementations, only the local multicast domain "local" is
supported. In the future, registering will be supported in any arbitrary
domain that has a working DNS Update server [RFC 2136]. The
.Ar domain
"." is a synonym for "pick a sensible default" which today
means "local".
.Pp
.Ar port
is a number from 0 to 65535, and is the TCP or UDP port number upon
which the service is listening.
.Pp 
Additional attributes of the service may optionally be described by
key/value pairs, which are stored in the advertised service's DNS TXT
record. Allowable keys and values are listed with the service
registration at
.Pa http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml .
.It Nm Fl B Ar type domain
browse for instances of service
.Ar type
in
.Ar domain .
.Pp
For valid 
.Ar type Ns s
see
.Pa http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml .
as described above. Omitting the
.Ar domain
or using "." means "pick a sensible default."
.It Nm Fl L Ar name type domain
look up and display the information necessary to contact and use the
named service: the hostname of the machine where that service is
available, the port number on which the service is listening, and (if
present) TXT record attributes describing properties of the service.
.Pp
Note that in a typical application, browsing may only happen rarely, while lookup
(or "resolving") happens every time the service is used. For example, a
user browses the network to pick a default printer fairly rarely, but once
a default printer has been picked, that named service is resolved to its
current IP address and port number every time the user presses Cmd-P to
print.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl P Ar name type domain port host IP Op Ar key=value ...
create a proxy advertisement for a service running on(offered by) some other machine.
The two new options are Host, a name for the device and IP, the address of it.
.Pp
The service for which you create a proxy advertisement does not necessarily have to be on your local network. 
You can set up a local proxy for a website on the Internet.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl q Ar name rrtype rrclass
look up any DNS name, resource record type, and resource record class, 
not necessarily DNS-SD names and record types.
If rrtype is not specified, it queries for the IPv4 address of the name, 
if rrclass is not specified, IN class is assumed. If the name is not a fully 
qualified domain name, then search domains may be appended.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl Z Ar type domain
browse for service instances and display output in zone file format.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl G Ns \ v4/v6/v4v6 Ar name
look up the IP address information of the name.
If v4 is specified, the IPv4 address of the name is looked up, 
if v6 is specified the IPv6 address is looked up. If v4v6 is specified both the IPv4 and IPv6 
address is looked up. If the name is not a fully qualified domain name, 
then search domains may be appended.
.Pp
.It Nm Fl V
return the version of the currently running daemon/system service.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
To advertise the existence of LPR printing service on port 515 on this
machine, such that it will be discovered by the Mac OS X printing software
and other DNS-SD compatible printing clients, use:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl R Ns \ \&"My Test\&" _printer._tcp. \&. 515 pdl=application/postscript
.Pp
For this registration to be useful, you need to actually have LPR service
available on port 515. Advertising a service that does not exist is not
very useful, and will be confusing and annoying to other people on the
network.
.Pp
Similarly, to advertise a web page being served by an HTTP
server on port 80 on this machine, such that it will show up in the
Bonjour list in Safari and other DNS-SD compatible Web clients, use:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl R Ns \ \&"My Test\&" _http._tcp \&. 80 path=/path-to-page.html
.Pp
To find the advertised web pages on the local network (the same list that
Safari shows), use:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl B Ns \ _http._tcp
.Pp
While that command is running, in another window, try the
.Nm Fl R
example given above to advertise a web page, and you should see the
"Add" event reported to the
.Nm Fl B
window. Now press Ctrl-C in the
.Nm Fl R
window and you should see the "Remove" event reported to the
.Nm Fl B
window.
.Pp
In the example below, the www.apple.com web page is advertised as a service called "apple", 
running on a target host called apple.local, which resolves to 17.149.160.49.
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl P Ns \ apple _http._tcp \&"\&"\& 80 apple.local 17.149.160.49
.Pp
The Bonjour menu in the Safari web browser will now show "apple".
The same IP address can be reached by entering apple.local in the web browser.
In either case, the request will be resolved to the IP address and browser will show
contents associated with www.apple.com.
.Pp
If a client wants to be notified of changes in server state, it can
initiate a query for the service's particular record and leave it running.
For example, to monitor the status of an iChat user you can use:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl q Ns \ someone@ex1._presence._tcp.local txt
.Pp
Everytime status of that user(someone) changes, you will see a new TXT record result reported.
.Pp
You can also query for a unicast name like www.apple.com and monitor its status.
.Pp 
.Dl Nm Fl q Ns \ www.apple.com

.Sh DRIVE SELECTION CRITERIA
.Bd -ragged
Some functions of
.Nm
operate on a specific drive. Since any number of
drives may be available, and they may come and go at any time, the device
selection arguments provide a method for selecting among them.
.Pp
The candidate list starts out as a list of all attached drives. One or more
arguments of the form
.Sy -drive
.Ar drive(s)
may be specified. Each argument has the
effect of narrowing the candidate list, depending on what
.Ar drive(s)
is. It may be:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -width "verbose" -offset left -compact
.It
A positive decimal number, assumed to be a 1-based index into the
candidate list. The candidate list is trimmed to just that device.
.Pp
.It
One of the following keywords:
.Sy "internal",
.Sy "external",
.Sy "usb",
.Sy "firewire",
.Sy "atapi",
.Sy "scsi".
The candidate list is trimmed to devices which match the specified 
location / bus. Case is ignored in this comparison.
.Pp
.It
Any other string, assumed to be a vendor/product name. The 
candidate list is trimmed to devices whose vendor or product 
strings exactly match the argument. Case (but not whitespace) is 
ignored in this comparison.
.El
.Pp
Multiple
.Sy -drive
arguments may be specified; each argument narrows the
candidate list further. After all the
.Sy -drive
arguments have been processed, the candidate list is considered. If
it contains exactly one item, that drive is used. If it contains
zero items,
.Nm
prints an error message and exits. If it contains more than one item,
the selected function is executed on all drives remaining in the list.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBdsa\fR command processes \s-1DSA\s0 keys. They can be converted between various
forms and their components printed out. \fBNote\fR This command uses the
traditional SSLeay compatible format for private key encryption: newer
applications should use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the \fBpkcs8\fR
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option with a private key uses
an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded form of an \s-1ASN.1 SEQUENCE\s0 consisting of the values of
version (currently zero), p, q, g, the public and private key components
respectively as \s-1ASN.1\s0 INTEGERs. When used with a public key it uses a
SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure: it is an error if the key is not \s-1DSA.\s0
.Sp
The \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR form is the default format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64
encoded with additional header and footer lines. In the case of a private key
PKCS#8 format is also accepted.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be
prompted for.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the input file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output by
is not specified. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be
prompted for. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same as the input
filename.
.IP "\fB\-passout arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passout arg"
the output file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-aes128|\-aes192|\-aes256|\-camellia128|\-camellia192|\-camellia256|\-des|\-des3|\-idea\fR" 4
.IX Item "-aes128|-aes192|-aes256|-camellia128|-camellia192|-camellia256|-des|-des3|-idea"
These options encrypt the private key with the specified
cipher before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.
If none of these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This
means that using the \fBdsa\fR utility to read in an encrypted key with no
encryption option can be used to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by
setting the encryption options it can be use to add or change the pass phrase.
These options can only be used with \s-1PEM\s0 format output files.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the public, private key components and parameters.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.
.IP "\fB\-modulus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modulus"
this option prints out the value of the public key component of the key.
.IP "\fB\-pubin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubin"
by default a private key is read from the input file: with this option a
public key is read instead.
.IP "\fB\-pubout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubout"
by default a private key is output. With this option a public
key will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the input is
a public key.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN1 DER\s0 encoded
form compatible with \s-1RFC2459 \s0(\s-1PKIX\s0) DSS-Parms that is a \s-1SEQUENCE\s0 consisting
of p, q and g respectively. The \s-1PEM\s0 form is the default format: it consists
of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64 encoded with additional header and footer lines.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or standard input if
this option is not specified. If the \fBnumbits\fR parameter is included then
this option will be ignored.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename parameters to. Standard output is used
if this option is not present. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same
as the input filename.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option inhibits the output of the encoded version of the parameters.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
this option prints out the \s-1DSA\s0 parameters in human readable form.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
this option converts the parameters into C code. The parameters can then
be loaded by calling the \fB\f(BIget_dsaXXX()\fB\fR function.
.IP "\fB\-genkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "-genkey"
this option will generate a \s-1DSA\s0 either using the specified or generated
parameters.
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.IP "\fBnumbits\fR" 4
.IX Item "numbits"
this option specifies that a parameter set should be generated of size
\&\fBnumbits\fR. It must be the last option. If this option is included then
the input file (if any) is ignored.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
does various operations against the Directory Service cache including gathering statistics, initiating lookups, inspection, cache flush, etc.  This tool replaces most of the functionality of the lookupd tool previously available in the OS.  
.Pp
.Sh FLAGS
A list of flags and their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width -ident
.It Fl h
Lists the options for calling
.Nm
.It Fl q Ar category
Initiate a query using standard calls.  These calls will either return results from the cache or go fetch live data and place them in the cache.  By default if no specific query is requested via
.Fl a
then all results within that category will be returned.
.It Fl a Ar key Ar value
Optional flag to 
.Fl q
for a specific key with a value.
.It Fl cachedump
Dumps an overview of the cache by default.  Additional flags will provide more detailed information.
.It Fl buckets
Used in conjunction with
.Fl cachedump
to also print hash bucket usage of the current cache.
.It Fl entries Op Ar category
Used in conjunction with
.Fl cachedump
to dump detailed information about cache entries.  An optional category can be supplied to only see types of interest.  Dumping 'host' entries can only be done by administrative users.
.It Fl configuration
Prints current configuration information, such as the search policy from Directory Service and cache parameters.
.It Fl flushcache
Flushes the entire cache.  This should only be used in extreme cases.  Validation information is used within the cache along with other techniques to ensure the OS has valid information available to it.
.It Fl statistics
Prints statistics from the cache including an overview and detailed call statistics.  Some calls are not cached but are derived from other calls internally.  Cache hits and cache misses may not always be equal to external calls.  For example getaddrinfo is actually a combination of gethostbyname with other calls internally to the cache to maximize cache hit rate.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a general-purpose utility for operating on Directory Service directory nodes.  Its commands allow one to create, read, and manage Directory Service data.  If invoked without any commands,
.Nm
runs in an interactive mode, reading commands from standard input.  Interactive processing is terminated by the
.Ar quit
command.  Leading dashes ("-") are optional for all commands.
.Pp
.Nm
operates on a datasource specified on the command line.  This may be a node name or a Mac OS X Server (10.2 or later) host specified by DNS hostname or IP address.  Node names may be absolute paths beginning with a slash ("/"), or relative domain paths beginning with a dot (".") character, which specifies the local domain, or "..", specifying the local domain's parent.  If the hostname or IP address form is used then the user must specify the
.Fl u
option and either the
.Fl P
of
.Fl p
options to specify an administrative user and password on the remote host to authenticate with to the remote host. The exception to this is if "localhost" is specified.  Passing passwords on the command line is inherently insecure and can cause password exposure.  For better security do not provide the password as part of the command and you will be securely prompted.
.Pp
The datasource may also be specified as "localonly" in which case a separate DirectoryService daemon process is activated which contains only the Local plugin for use by dscl.  If no file path is provided then access goes only to the registered local nodes on the system. However, if the
.Fl f
option is specified then access is added to the local node "/Local/Target" which points to the database located at the provided filepath. One example is to provide the filepath of "/Volumes/Build100/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default" and then access to that database is provided via the nodename "/Local/Target".
.Pp
.Sh PATH SPECIFICATION
There are two modes of operation when specifying paths to operate on. The two modes correspond to whether the datasource is a node or a host. In the case of specifying a node, the top level of paths will be record types. Example top level paths would be:
.Pp
.Dl /Users/alice
.Dl /Groups/admin
.Pp
In the case of specifying a host as a data source, the top level of paths correspond to Open Directory plug-ins and Search Paths. One can specify the plug-in to traverse to a node name, after which the paths are equivalent to the former usage. The following might be the equivalent paths as the above paths:
.Pp
.Dl /NetInfo/root/Users/alice
.Dl /LDAPv3/10.0.1.42/Groups/admin
.Pp
If path components contain keys or values with embedded slash characters, the slash characters must be escaped with a leading backslash character.  Since the shell also processes escape characters, an extra backslash is required to correctly specify an escape.  For example, to read a mount record with the name "ldapserver:/Users" in the "/Mounts" path, the following path would be used:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Li "\& ." Fl read Li "/Mounts/ldaphost:\\e\\&/Users"
.Pp
All pathnames are case-sensitive.
.Sh COMMANDS
The action of each command is described below.  Some commands have aliases.  For example, "cat" and "." are aliases for "read".  Command aliases are listed in parentheses.
.Ss read (cat .)
Usage: read
.Op Ar path Op Ar key Li "..."
.Pp
Prints a directory.  The property key is followed by colon, then a space-separated list of the values for that property. If any value contains embedded spaces, the list will instead be displayed one entry per line, starting on the line after the key.
.Pp
If The 
.Fl raw
flag for raw output has been given, then
.Sx read
prints the full DirectoryService API constant for record and attribute types.
.Pp
If the
.Fl url
flag has been specified then printed record path attribute values are encoded in the style of URLs. This is useful if a script or program is trying to process the output since values will not have any spaces or other control characters.
.Ss readall
Usage: readall
.Op Ar path Op Ar key Li "..."
.Pp
.Sx readall
prints all the records of a given type.  The output of readall is formatted in the same way as
.Sx read
with a "-" on a line as a delimeter between records.
.Ss readpl
Usage: readpl
.Ar path Ar key Ar plist_path
.Pp
Prints the contents of
.Ar plist_path "."
The
.Ar plist_path
is followed by a colon, then a whitespace, and then the value for the path.
.Pp
If the
.Ar plist_path
is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of it are displayed in plist form after the
.Ar plist_path "."
If
.Ar plist_path
is the key for a string, number, bool, date, or data object, only the value is printed out after the
.Ar plist_path "."
.Ss readpli
Usage: readpli
.Ar path Ar key Ar value_index Ar plist_path
.Pp
Prints the contents of
.Ar plist_path
for the plist at
.Ar value_index
of the key.
The
.Ar plist_path
is followed by a colon, then a whitespace, and then the value for the path.
.Pp
If the
.Ar plist_path
is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of it are displayed in plist form after the
.Ar plist_path "."
If
.Ar plist_path
is the key for a string, number, bool, date, or data object, only the value is printed out after the
.Ar plist_path "."
.Ss list (ls)
Usage: list
.Ar path
.Pp
Lists the subdirectories of the given directory.  Subdirectories are listed one per line.  In the case of listing a search path, the names are preceded by an index number that can act as a shortcut and used in place of the name when specifying a path.
.Pp
When used in interactive mode, the path is optional.  With no path given, the current directory will be used.
.Ss search
.Ar path key val
.Pp
Searches for records that match a pattern.  The search is rooted at the given path.  The path may be a node path or a record type path.  Valid keys are Directory Service record attribute types.
.Ss create (mk)
Usage: create
.Ar record_path
.Oo Ar key
.Op Ar val Li "..."
.Oc
.Pp
Creates a record, property, or value.  If only a record path is given, the
.Sx create
command will create the record if it does not exist.  If a key is given, then a property with that key will be created.
.Pp
WARNING - If a property with the given key already exists, it will be destroyed and a new property will be created in its place.  To add values to an existing property, use the
.Sx append
or 
.Sx merge
commands.
.Pp
If values are included in the command, these values will be set for the given key.
.Pp
NOTE - Not all directory nodes support a property without a value. An error will be given if you attempt to create a property with no value in such a directory node.
.Ss createpl
Usage: createpl
.Ar record_path Ar key Ar plist_path Ar val1 Op Ar val2 Li "..."
.Pp
Creates a string, or array of strings at
.Ar plist_path "."
.Pp
If you are creating a value at the root of a plist that is an array, simply use "0" as the
.Ar plist_path "."
.Pp
If only
.Ar val1
is specified, a string will be created at
.Ar plist_path "."
If
.Ar val1 val2 Li "..."
are specified, an array of strings will be created at
.Ar plist_path "."
.Pp
WARNING - If a value with the given
.Ar plist_path
already exists, it will be destroyed and a new value will be created in its place.
.Ss createpli
Usage: createpli
.Ar record_path Ar key Ar value_index Ar plist_path Ar val1 Op Ar val2 Li "..."
.Pp
Creates a string, or array of strings at
.Ar plist_path
for the plist at
.Ar value_index
of the key.
.Pp
If you are creating a value at the root of a plist that is an array, simply use "0" as the
.Ar plist_path "."
.Pp
If only
.Ar val1
is specified, a string will be created at
.Ar plist_path "."
If
.Ar val1 val2 Li "..."
are specified, an array of strings will be created at
.Ar plist_path "."
.Pp
WARNING - If a value with the given
.Ar plist_path
already exists, it will be destroyed and a new value will be created in its place.
.Ss append
Usage: append
.Ar record_path key val Li "..."
.Pp
Appends one or more values to a property in a given record.  The property is created if it does not exist.
.Ss merge
Usage: merge
.Ar record_path key val Li "..."
.Pp
Appends one or more values to a property in a given directory if the property does not already have those values.  The property is created if it does not exist.
.Ss change
Usage: change
.Ar record_path key old_val new_val
.Pp
Replaces the given old value in the list of values of the given key with the new value in the specified record.
.Ss changei
Usage: changei
.Ar path key index val
.Pp
Replaces the value at the given index in the list of values of the given key with the new value in the specified record.  
.Ar index
is an integer value.  An index of 1 specifies the first value.  An index greater than the number of values in the list will result in an error.
.Ss diff
Usage: diff
.Ar path1 path2 key Li "..."
.Pp
Compares the data from path1 and path2 looking at the specified keys (or all if no keys are specified).
.Ss delete (rm)
Usage: delete
.Ar path
.Oo
.Ar key Op Ar val Li "..."
.Oc
.Pp
Delete a directory, property, or value.  If a directory path is given, the
.Sx delete
command will delete the directory.  This can only be used on record type and record paths.  If a key is given, then a property with that key will be deleted.  If one or more values are given, those values will be removed from the property with the given key.
.Ss deletepl
Usage: deletepl
.Ar record_path Ar key Ar plist_path Op val Li "..."
.Pp
Deletes a value in a plist.  If no values are given
.Sx deletepl
deletes the
.Ar plist_path "."
If one or more values are given,
.Sx deletepl
deletes the values within
.Ar plist_path "."
.Ss deletepli
Usage: deletepli
.Ar record_path Ar key Ar value_index Ar plist_path Op val Li "..."
.Pp
Deletes a value for the plist at
.Ar value_index
of the key.  If no values are given
.Sx deletepli
deletes the
.Ar plist_path "."
If one or more values are given,
.Sx deletepli
deletes the values within
.Ar plist_path "."
.Ss passwd
Usage: passwd
.Ar user_path
.Op Ar new_pasword | old_password new_pasword
.Pp
Changes a password for a user. The user must be specified by full path, not just a username.  If you are authenticated to the node (either by specifying the
.Fl u
and
.Fl P
flags or by using the auth command when in interactive node) then you can simply specify a new password.  If you are not authenticated or if FileVault is enabled then the user's old password must be specified.  If passwords are not specified while in interactive mode, you will be prompted for them.  Passing these passwords on the command line is inherently insecure and can cause password exposure.  For better security do not provide the password as part of the command and you will be securely prompted.
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.Ss cd
Usage: cd dir
.Pp
Sets the current directory.  Path names for other
.Nm
commands may be relative to the current directory.
.Ss pushd (pd)
Usage: pushd path
.Pp
Similar to the pushd command commonly found in Unix shells.  When a path is specified it sets the current directory while pushing the previous directory on to the directory stack.  If no path is specified it exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack.  It will also print the final directory stack.
.Ss popd
Usage: popd
.Pp
Pops the directory stack and returns to the new top directory.  It will also print the final directory stack.
.Ss auth (su)
Usage: auth
.Op Ar user Op Ar password
.Pp
Authenticate as the named user, or as "root" if no user is specified.  If a password is supplied, then that password is used for authentication, otherwise the command prompts for a password.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is run in host mode, then when this command is run the current directory must be in the subdirectories of a node.
.Ss authonly
Usage: authonly
.Op Ar user Op Ar password
.Pp
Used to verify the password of a named user, or of "root" if no user is specified.  If a password is supplied, then that password is used for authentication, otherwise the command prompts for a password.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is run in host mode, then when this command is run the current directory must be in the subdirectories of a node.
.Ss quit (q)
Usage: quit
.Pp
Ends processing of interactive commands and terminates the program.
.Ss command history
The up and down arrow keys will scan through the command history. 
.Ss tab completion
When pathnames are being typed, pressing the tab key will result in a search to auto-complete the typed partial subdirectory name. It will also attempt to correct capitilization in the process.

.It Fl f
Bindings will be established or dropped in conjunction with the addition or removal of the LDAP server configuration.
.It Fl v
This enables the logging to stdout of the details of the operations. This can be redirected to a file.
.It Fl i
You will be prompted for a password to use in conjunction with a specified username.
.It Fl s
This ensures that no clear text passwords will be sent to the LDAP server during authentication.  This will only be enabled if the server supports non-cleartext methods.
.It Fl e
This ensures that if the server is capable of supporting encryption methods (i.e., SSL or Kerberos) that encryption will be enforced at all times via policy.
.It Fl m
This ensures that man-in-the-middle capabilities will be enforced via Kerberos, if the server supports the capability.
.It Fl g
This ensures that packet signing capabilities will be enforced via Kerberos, if the server supports the capability.
.It Fl x
Connection to the LDAP server will only be made over SSL.
.It Fl S
Will skip updating the search policies.
.It Fl N
Will assume Yes for installing certificates
.It Fl h
Display usage statement.
.It Fl a Ar servername
This is either the fully qualified domain name or correct IP address of the LDAP server to be added to the DirectoryService LDAPv3 configuration.
.It Fl r Ar servername
This is either the fully qualified domain name or correct IP address of the LDAP server to be removed from the DirectoryService LDAPv3 configuration.
.It Fl n Ar configname
This is the UI configuration label that is to be given the LDAP server configuration.
.It Fl c Ar computerid
This is the name to be used for directory binding to the LDAP server. If none is given the first substring, before a period, of the hostname (the defined environment variable "HOST") is used.
.It Fl u Ar username
Username of a privileged network user to be used in authenticated directory binding.
.It Fl p Ar password
Password for the privileged network user.  This is a less secure method of providing a password, as it may be viewed via process list.  For stronger security leave the option off and you will be prompted for a password.
.It Fl l Ar username
Username of a local administrator.
.It Fl q Ar password
Password for the local administrator.  This is a less secure method of providing a password, as it may be viewed via process list.  For stronger security leave the option off and you will be prompted for a password.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
-a ldap.company.com
.Pp
The LDAP server config for the LDAP server myldap.company.com will be added. If authenticated directory binding is required by the LDAP server, then this call will fail. Otherwise, the following parameters configname, computerid, and local admin name will respectively pick up these defaults: ip address of the LDAP servername, substring up to first period of fully qualified hostname, and username of the user in the shell this tool was invoked.
.Pp
.Nm
-r ldap.company.com
.Pp
The LDAP server config for the LDAP server myldap.company.com will be removed but not unbound since no network user credentials were supplied.  The local admin name will be the username of the user in the shell this tool was invoked.

.Sh NAME
.Nm dsexport
.Nd export records from OpenDirectory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -N
.Op Fl r Ar record_list
.Op Fl e Ar exclude_attributes
.Op Fl a Ar address Fl u Ar username Op Fl p Ar password
.Ar output_file
.Ar node_path
.Ar record_type
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility exports records from Open Directory.
.Pp
The first argument is the path to the output file.
If the file already exists it will be overwritten.
.Pp
The second argument is the path to the OpenDirectory node from which the records will be read.
.Pp
The third argument is the type of record to export.
If the record type does not begin with
.Sq dsRecTypeStandard:
or
.Sq dsRecTypeNative: ,
the
.Nm
utility will determine if the node supports a standard attribute by the specified name;
otherwise,
.Nm
will assume that the record type is native.
A warning will be printed if the record type is converted.
Standard record types can be listed using the following command:
.Sq dscl -raw \&. -list / .
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -N 
Export all attributes, including native attributes.
By default,
.Nm
only exports standard attributes.
.It Fl r Ar record_list
Comma-separated list of records to export from the specified node.
The
.Fl r
option may be used multiple times to specify additional records to export.
If the
.Fl r
option is not specified,
.Nm
will attempt to export all records.
.It Fl e Ar exclude
Comma-separated list of attributes that should not be exported.
The
.Fl e
option may be used multiple times to specify additional attributes to exclude.
The following attributes are always excluded:
.Sq dsAttrTypeStandard:AppleMetaNodeLocation ,
.Sq dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordType ,
.Sq dsAttrTypeNative:objectClass .
.It Fl a Ar address
Address of the desired proxy machine.
.It Fl u Ar username
Username to use for the proxy connection
.It Fl p Ar password
Password to use for the proxy connection.
If the
.Fl p
option is not specified,
.Nm
will interactively prompt for the password.
.El
.Sh NOTES
When using an LDAP node, please be aware that
.Nm
can only export as many records as the LDAP server is willing to return.
If the LDAP server has several thousand users, you may want to raise the maximum number of search results that the server returns.
This can be done in Server Admin (my.server.com>OpenDirectory>Settings>Protocols tab).
By default this is set to 11000 results.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Export all user records from the local node to
.Sq export.out :
.Pp
.Dl $ dsexport export.out /Local/Default dsRecTypeStandard:Users
.Pp
Export the group records for
.Sq admin
and
.Sq staff
from the LDAPv3 node on a proxy machine
.Sq proxy.machine.com :
.Pp
.Dl $ dsexport export.out /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 dsRecTypeStandard:Groups -r admin,staff -a proxy.machine.com -u diradmin -p password
.Pp
Export augmented users from the LDAPv3 node, including native attributes but excluding the PasswordPlus attribute:
.Pp
.Dl $ dsexport augments.out /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 dsRecTypeStandard:Augments --N -e \&"dsAttrTypeStandard:PasswordPlus"

.Bl -tag -width abcefghij
.It Ar filepath
is the path of the file to be imported.
.It Ar nodepath
is the path of the Open Directory node where the records should be imported.
.It A flag that specifies how to handle conflicting records:
.Bl -tag -width abcdefg
.It O
overwrite of any existing records that have the same record name, UID or GID. All previous attribute values are deleted.
.It M
merge import data with existing records or create the record if it does not exist.
.It I
ignore the record if there is a conflicting name, UID or GID.
.It A
append the data to existing records, but do not create a record if it does not exist.
.It N
no duplicate checking should be done.  Note this could cause failures and/or a slower import process.

.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
A list of options and their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl -crypt
is used to signify that all user passwords are crypt-based. Entries in the import file can also be prefixed with {CRYPT} on a per record basis if not all users are crypt-based.  By default all passwords are assumed to be provided as listed in the import file.
.It Fl -force Ar attribute Ar value
forces a specific value for the named attribute for all records during the import. The new value will overwrite any value specified in the import file. This option may be specified multiple times for forcing more than one attribute.
.It Fl -groupid Ar value
is the GID used for any records that do not specify a primary GID.
.It Fl -grouppreset Ar value
designate a preset record to be applied to imported group records.
.It Fl -loglevel Ar value
changes the amount of logging detail output to the log file.
.It Fl -outputfile Ar value
Outputs a plist to the specified file with a list of changed users or groups and rejected records due to name conflicts.
Also includes a list of deleted records (overwrite mode), and lists of records that failed and succeeded during import.
The format of this file is likely to change in a future release of Mac OS X.
.It Fl -password Ar value
is the admin's password for import operations. Used to authenticate to the directory node during import. A secure prompt will be used for interactive input if not supplied via parameter.  Using the prompt method is the most secure method of providing password to 
.Nm .
.It Fl -recordformat Ar string
passes in the delimiters and attributes and record type to specify the order and names of attributes in the file to be imported. An example record format string: 
.Pp
0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 7 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName dsAttrTypeStandard:Password dsAttrTypeStandard:UniqueID dsAttrTypeStandard:PrimaryGroupID dsAttrTypeStandard:RealName dsAttrTypeStandard:NFSHomeDirectory dsAttrTypeStandard:UserShell
.Pp
A special value of IGNORE can be used for values that should be ignored in the import file on a record-by-record basis.
.It Fl -recordtype Ar type
Override the record type defined in the import file. For example, to import ComputerGroups as ComputerLists, use:
.Pp
.Fl -recordtype Ar dsRecTypeStandard:ComputerLists
.Pp
The opposite works for importing ComputerLists as ComputerGroups, and so on.
.It Fl -remotehost Ar hostname | ipaddress
connects to a remote host at the network address specified.  Commonly used to import to a remote Mac OS X Server.
.It Fl -remoteusername Ar value
specifies user name to use for the remote connection.
.It Fl -remotepassword Ar value
specifies password to use for the remote connection. A secure prompt will be used to ask for the password if
.Fl -remoteusername
is specified and
.Fl -remotepassword
is not.  Using the prompt method is the most secure method of providing password to 
.Nm .
.It Fl -startid Ar value
indicates the ID number to start with when the import tool generates user or group IDs for any import file that lacks an ID as part of the import data. 
.It Fl -template Ar StandardUser | StandardGroup
is used for delimited import of files that lack field descriptions.
.Pp
.Ar StandardUser
contains the following fields in the order: 
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
RecordName
.It
Password
.It
UniqueID

.El
.It Fl -username Ar value
is the admin username to use when importing records. If this is not specified the current user is the default name.  Also, if used in conjunction with 
.Fl -remotehost
then this admin user will be used for the Open Directory node whereas the username provided in
.Fl -remoteusername
will be used for the remote connection.  If this option is left off but
.Fl -remoteusername
is provided, then the remote username will be used for both the connection and for importing records.
.It Fl -userpreset Ar value
designate a preset record to be applied to imported user records.

.SH OVERVIEW
The \fIdtrace\fP command is a generic front-end to the DTrace facility.  The command implements a simple interface to invoke the D language compiler, the ability to retrieve buffered trace data from the DTrace kernel facility, and a set of basic routines to format and print traced data.
Due to the kernel facility it uses to operate, the \fIdtrace\fP command requires root privileges.
.br
.P
Users new to DTrace are encouraged to read:
\fIHow to Use Oracle Solaris DTrace from Oracle Solaris and OpenSolaris System\fP. Oracle, 2010. Available on the web at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/solaris-dtrace-wp-167895.pdf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIdtrace\fP command provides a generic interface to all of the essential services provided by the DTrace facility, including:
." If I wanted numbered lists, I'd use .IP n[step] 3 for the first and .IP n+[step] for each other entry
.IP \(bu 2
Options to list the set of probes and providers currently published by DTrace
.IP \(bu
Options to enable probes directly using any of the probe description specifiers (provider, module, function, name)
.IP \(bu
Options to run the D compiler and compile one or more D program files or programs written directly on the command-line
.IP \(bu
Options to generate anonymous tracing programs
.IP \(bu
Options to generate program stability reports
.IP \(bu
Options to modify DTrace tracing and buffering behavior and enable additional D compiler features
.SH OPTIONS
\fIdtrace\fP has the following options:
.TP 7
.B \-arch\fR \fIarch_name\fR
Set dtrace's target data model. See \fIarch\fR(1) for a list of currently supported architectures.
.TP
.B \-a
Claim anonymous tracing state and display the traced data.  You can combine the \fB\-a\fP option with the \fB\-e\fP option to force \fIdtrace\fP to exit immediately after consuming the anonymous tracing state rather than continuing to wait for new data.
.TP
.B \-A
Generate a plist(5) of directives for anonymous tracing.  If the \fB\-A\fP option is specified, \fIdtrace\fP compiles any D programs specified using the \fB\-s\fP option or on the command-line and constructs a plist(5) of dtrace directives to enable the specified probes for anonymous trcaing and then exits.  By default, \fIdtrace\fP attempts to store the plist to the file /System/Library/Extensions/dtrace_dof.kext/Contents/Info.plist.  This behavior can be modified using the \fB\-o\fP option to specify an alternate output file.
.TP
.B \-b
Set principal trace buffer size.  The trace buffer size can include any of the size suffixes \fBk\fP, \fBm\fP, \fBg\fP, or \fBt\fP.  If the buffer space cannot be allocated, \fIdtrace\fP attempts to reduce the buffer size or exit depending on the setting of the bufresize property.
.TP
.B \-c
Run the specified command \fIcmd\fR and exit upon its completion. If more than one \fB-c\fR option is present on the command line, \fBdtrace\fR exits when all commands
have exited, reporting the exit status for each child process as it terminates. The process-ID of the first command is made available to any D programs specified 
on the command line or using the \fB-s\fR option through the \fB$target\fR macro variable.
.TP
.B \-C
Run the C preprocessor of \fIclang\fP over D programs before compiling them.  Options can be passed to the C preprocessor using the \fB\-D\fP, \fB\-U\fP, \fB\-I\fP, and \fB\-H\fP options.  The degree of C standard conformance can be selected using the \fB\-X\fP option.  Refer to the description of the \fB\-X\fP option for a description of the set of tokens defined by the D compiler when invoking the C preprocessor.
.TP
.B \-D
Define the specified \fIname\fP when invoking \fIclang\fP (enabled using the \fB\-C\fP option).  If an equals sign (=) and additional \fIvalue\fP are specified, the name is assigned the corresponding value.  This options passes the \fB\-D\fP option to each \fIclang\fP invocation.
.TP
.B \-e
Exit after compiling any requests and consuming anonymous tracing state (\fB\-a\fP option) but prior to enabling any probes.  This option can be combined with the \fB\-a\fP option to print anonymous tracing data and exit, or it can be compiled with D compiler options to verify that programs compile without actually executing them and enabling the corresponding instrumentation.
.TP
.B \-f
Specify function name to trace or list (\fB\-l\fP option).  The corresponding argument can include any of the probe description forms \fIprovider\fP:\fImodule\fP:\fIfunction\fP, \fImodule\fP:\fIfunction\fP, or \fIfunction\fP.  Unspecified probe description fields are left blank and match any probes regardless of the values in those fields.  If no qualifiers other than \fIfunction\fP are specified in the description, all probes with the corresponding \fIfunction\fP are matched.  The \fB\-f\fP argument can be suffiexed with an optional D probe clause.  More than one \fB\-f\fP option may be specified on the command-line at a time.
.TP
.B \-F
Coalesce trace output by identifying function entry and return.  Function entry probe reports are indented and their output is prefixed with \->.  Function return probe reports are unindented and their output is prefixed with <-.
.TP
.B \-h
Generate a header file containing macro definitions for USDT probes. If the \fB\-o\fP option is present, the header file is saved using the pathname specified as the argument for this flag. If the \fB\-o\fP option is not present and the DTrace program is contained in a file whose name is filename.d, the header file is saved using the name filename.h.
.TP
.B \-H
Print the pathnames of included files when invoking \fIclang\fP (enabled using the \fB\-C\fP option).  This option passes the \fB\-H\fP option to each \fIclang\fP invocation, causing it to display the list of pathnames, one per line, to stderr.
.TP
.B \-i
Specify probe identifier to trace or list (\fB\-l\fP option).  Probe IDs are specified using decimal integers as shown by \fIdtrace\fP \fB\-l\fP.  The \fB\-i\fP argument can be suffixed with an optional D probe clause.  More than one \fB\-i\fP option may be specified on the command-line at a time.
.TP
.B \-I
Add the specified directory \fIpath\fP to the search path for #include files when invoking \fIclang\fP (enabled using the \fB\-C\fP option).  This option passes the \fB\-I\fP option to each \fIclang\fP invocation.  The specified directory is inserted into the search path ahead of the default directory list.
.TP
.B \-l
List all probes matching probe specifications appearing in \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-m\fP, \fB\-n\fP, or \fB\-P\fP options. No tracing is initiated for any probes.
.TP
.B \-L
Add the specified directory \fIpath\fP to the search path for DTrace libraries.  DTrace libraries are used to contain common definitions that may be used when writing D programs.  The specified \fIpath\fP is added after the default library search path.
.TP
.B \-m
Specify module name to trace or list (\fB\-l\fP option).  The corresponding argument can include any of the probe description forms \fIprovider\fP:\fImodule\fP or \fImodule\fP.  Unspecified probe description fields are left blank and match any probes regardless of the values in those fields.  If no qualifiers other than \fImodule\fP are specified in the description, all probes with a corresponding \fImodule\fP are matched.  The \fB\-m\fP argument can be suffixed with an optional D probe clause.  More than one \fB\-m\fP option may be specified on the command-line at a time.
.TP
.B \-n
Specify probe name to trace or list (\fB\-l\fP option).  The corresponding argument can include any of the probe description forms \fIprovider\fP:\fImodule\fP:\fIfunction\fP:\fIname\fP, \fImodule\fP:\fIfunction\fP:\fIname\fP, \fIfunction\fP:\fIname\fP, or \fIname\fP.  Unspecified probe description fields are left blank and match any probes regardless of the values in those fields.  If no qualifiers other than \fIname\fP are specified in the description, all probes with a corresponding name are matched.  The \fB\-n\fP argument can be suffixed with an optional D probe clause.  More than one \fB\-n\fP option may be specified on the command-line at a time.
.TP
.B \-o
Specify the \fIoutput\fP file for the \fB\-A\fP and \fB\-l\fP options, or for the traced data.  If the \fB\-A\fP option is present, and \fB\-o\fP is not present, the default output file is /kernel/drv/dtrace.conf.
.br
Note that with successive invocations of dtrace with the -o option, dtrace does not overwrite, but rather appends to the output file.
.TP
.B \-p
Grab the specified process-ID \fIpid\fR, cache its symbol tables, and exit upon its completion. If more than one \fB-p\fR option is present on the command line, \fBdtrace\fR
exits when all commands have exited, reporting the exit status for each process as it terminates. The first process-ID is made available to any D programs spe
cified on the command line or using the \fB-s\fR option through the \fB$target\fR macro variable. 
.TP
.B \-P
Specify provider name to trace or list (\fB\-l\fP option).  The remaining probe description fields module, function, and name are left blank and match any probes regardless of the values in those fields.  The \fB\-P\fP argument can be suffixed with an optional D probe clause.  More than one \fB\-P\fP option may be specified on the command-line at a time.
.TP
.B \-q
Set quiet mode.  \fIdtrace\fP will suppress messages such as the number of probes matched by the specified options and D programs will not print column headers, the CPU ID, the probe ID, or insert newlines into the output.  Only data traced and formatted by D program statements such as \fBtrace()\fP and \fBprintf()\fP will be displayed to stdout.
.TP
.B \-s
Compile the specified D program source file.  If the \fB\-e\fP option is present, the program is compiled but no instrumentation is enabled.  If the \fB\-l\fP option is specified, the program is compiled and the set of probes matched by it is listed, but no instrumentation will be enabled.  If neither \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-l\fP are present, the instrumentation specified by the D program is enabled and tracing begins.
.TP
.B \-S
Show D compiler intermediate code.  The D compiler will produce a report of the intermediate code generated for each D program to stderr.
.TP
.B \-U
Undefine the specified \fIname\fP when invoking \fIclang\fP (enabled using the \fB\-C\fP option).  This option passes the \fB\-U\fP option to each \fIclang\fP invocation.
.TP
.B \-v
Set verbose mode.  If the \fB\-v\fP option is specified, \fIdtrace\fP produces a program stability report showing the minimum interface stability and dependency level for the specified D programs.
.TP
.B \-V
Report the highest D programming interface version supported by \fIdtrace\fP.  The version informaion is printed to stdout and the dtrace command exits.
.TP
.B \-w
Allow destructive actions. D programs containing destructive actions will fail to compile unless this flag is specified.
.TP
.B \-W
Wait for the specified process \fIpname\fR, cache its symbol tables, and exit upon its completion.  If more than one \fB-W\fR option is present on the command line, \fBdtrace\fR will
start tracing when all processes have been executed, in the order they have been specified.  Furthermore, \fBdtrace\fR exits when all processes have exited, reporting the exit status for each process
as it terminates.  The first process-ID  is made available to any D programs specified on the command line or using the \fB-s\fR option through the \fB$target\fR macro variable.
Using this option automatically activates the \fB-Z\fR option.
.TP
.B \-x
Enable or modify a DTrace runtime option or D compiler option.  Boolean options are enabled by specifying their name.  Options with values are set by separating the option name and value with an equals sign (=).
.TP
.B -Z
Permit probe descriptions that match zero probes.  If the \fB\-Z\fP option is not specified, \fIdtrace\fP will report an error and exit if any probe descriptions specified in D program files (\fB\-s\fP option) or on the command-line (\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-m\fP, \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-n\fP, or \fB\-i\fP options) contain descriptions that do not match any known probes.
.SH OPERANDS
Zero or more additional arguments may be specified on the \fIdtrace\fP command line to define a set of macro variables ($1, $2, and so on) to be used in any D programs specified using the \fB\-s\fP option or on the command-line.
.SH C++ MANGLED NAMES
By default, \fIdtrace\fP uses the demangled names of C++ symbols. You can tell \fIdtrace\fP to use the mangled symbol names by passing \fI-xmangled\fP to the command.
.SH OBJECTIVE C PROVIDER
The Objective C provider is similar to the pid provider, and allows instrumentation of Objective C classes and methods. Objective C probe specifiers use the following format:
.TP 7
.B objc\fIpid\fR:[\fIclass-name\fR[(\fIcategory-name\fR)]]:[[+|-]\fImethod-name\fR]:[\fIname\fR]
.TP
.B pid
The id number of the process.
.TP
.B class-name
The name of the Objective C class.
.TP
.B category-name
The name of the category within the Objective C class.
.TP
.B method-name
The name of the Objective C method.
.TP
.B name
The name of the probe, \fBentry\fR, \fBreturn\fR, or an integer instruction offset within the method.
.SH OBJECTIVE C PROVIDER EXAMPLES
.TP
.B objc123:NSString:-*:entry
Every instance method of class NSString in process 123.
.TP
.B objc123:NSString(*)::entry
Every method on every category of class NSString in process 123.
.TP
.B objc123:NSString(foo):+*:entry
Every class method in NSString's foo category in process 123.
.TP
.B objc123::-*:entry
Every instance method in every class and category in process 123.
.TP
.B objc123:NSString(foo):-dealloc:entry
The dealloc method in the foo category of class NSString in process 123.
.TP
.B objc123::method?with?many?colons:entry
The method method:with:many:colons in every class in process 123. (A \fB?\fR wildcard must be used to match colon characters inside of Objective C method names, as they would otherwise be parsed as the provider field separators.)
.SH BUILDING CODE CONTAINING USDT PROBES
The process of adding USDT probes to code is slightly different than documented in the \fISolaris Dynamic Tracing Guide\fP. The steps for adding probes are as follows:
.IP 1. 3
Name the provider and specify its probes, using the following form:
.P
.RS 8
provider\ Example\ {
.br
\	probe\ increment(int);
.br
};
.RE
.IP "" 3
This defines the \fBExample\fP provider with one probe, \fBincrement\fP, that takes a single int argument. Providers can define multiple probes and probes can take multiple arguments.
.IP 2. 3
Process the provider description into a header file.
.IP
The provider description must be converted into a form usable by ObjC/C/C++ code. The dtrace command should be invoked with the \fB\-h\fP flag to do this.
.IP
.RS 8
\fBdtrace \-h \-s exampleProvider.d\fP
.RE
.IP "" 3
This will generate a header file named \fBexampleProvider.h\fP
.IP 3. 3
Add probe invocations to the application
.IP
For each probe defined in the provider, the provider.h file will contain two macros.The naming is as follows:
.IP
.RS 8
\fBPROVIDER_PROBENAME()
.br
PROVIDER_PROBENAME_ENABLED()\fP
.RE
.IP "" 3
In the Example provider, the increment probe becomes:
.RS 8
.P
\fBEXAMPLE_INCREMENT()
.br
EXAMPLE_INCREMENT_ENABLED()\fP
.RE
.IP "" 3
Place a macro invocation in the code at each site to be traced. If the arguments passed to a probe are expensive to calculate, you may guard the probe placement like this:
.P
.RS 8
if (EXAMPLE_INCREMENT_ENABLED()) {
.br
\	argument = /* Expensive argument calculation code here */;
.br
\	EXAMPLE_INCREMENT(argument);
.br
};
.RE
.IP "" 3
The if test will only succeed when the increment probe is active.
.IP 4. 3
Compile and link your program normally. No additional compiler or linker flags are required.
.IP
.SH OS X BUILTIN VARIABLE CHANGES
A small number of DTrace builtin variables have OS X specific changes:
.TP
.B execname
A string giving the name that was passed to exec(2) to execute the current process.
The string consists of at most MAXCOMLEN-1 characters.
The constant MAXCOMLEN is defined in /usr/include/sys/param.h to be 16.
.TP
.B machtimestamp
A uint64_t timestamp returning mach_absolute_time().
.TP
.B tid
A uint64_t thread ID of the currently executing thread. The thread ID is guaranteed to be unique and non repeating. The tid value is not equivalent to pthread_self.
.SH OS X SPECIFIC ACTIONS
.TP
.B pidresume(pid)
The pidresume(pid) action is a destructive action meant to be used in conjunction with the stop() action.  
While the stop() action will task_suspend the currently running process, the pidresume(pid) action will task_resume it.  
The pidresume(pid) action will only act on a process that has been stopped using the dtrace stop() action.
Passing a pid for a process that does not exist, or that was not stopped using dtrace stop() action, will result in an error.
.SH OS X SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.TP
.B nojtanalysis (boolean)
The default behavior of the pid provider is to bail out when it detects a jump
table. This results in missing return probes. The nojtanalysis option disables
the jump table analysis. Please note that use of this option is discouraged,
inappropriately placed probes may cause data corruption or even crashes in the
target process.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned by the \fIdtrace\fP utility:
.TP
.B 0
The specified requests were completed successfully.  For D program requests, the 0 exit status indicates that programs were successfully compiled, probes were successfully enabled, or anonymous state was successfully retrieved.  \fIdtrace\fP returns 0 even if the specified tracing requests encountered errors or drops.
.TP
.B 1
A fatal error occurred.  For D program requests, the 1 exit status indicates that program compilation failed or that the specified request could not be satisfied.
.TP
.B 2
Invalid command-line options or arguments were specified.

.SH NAME
dtruss \- process syscall details. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dtruss
[\-acdeflhoLs] [\-t syscall] { \-p PID | \-n name | command }
.SH DESCRIPTION
dtruss prints details on process system calls. It is like a DTrace
version of truss, and has been designed to be less intrusive than
truss.

Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which
can identify both system calls that are slow to complete, and those
which are consuming CPU cycles.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP

print all details
.TP
\-b bufsize
dynamic variable buffer size. Increase this if you notice dynamic
variable drop errors. The default is "4m" for 4 megabytes per CPU.
.TP
\-c
print system call counts
.TP
\-d
print relative timestamps, us
.TP
\-e
print elapsed times, us
.TP
\-f
follow children as they are forked
.TP
\-l
force printing of pid/lwpid per line
.TP
\-L
don't print pid/lwpid per line
.TP
\-n name
examine processes with this name
.TP
\-o
print on-cpu times, us
.TP
\-s
print stack backtraces
.TP
\-p PID

.SH DESCRIPTION
The dynamic linker uses the following environment variables.
They affect any program that uses the dynamic linker.
.TP
.B DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain frameworks.
The dynamic linker searches these directories before it searches for the
framework by its install name.
It allows you to test new versions of existing
frameworks. (A framework is a library install name that ends in the form
XXX.framework/Versions/YYY/XXX or XXX.framework/XXX, where XXX and YYY are any
name.)
.IP
For each framework that a program uses, the dynamic linker looks for the
framework in each directory in 
.SM DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
in turn. If it looks in all the directories and can't find the framework, it
searches the directories in  
.SM DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
in turn. If it still can't find the framework, it then searches 
.SM DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH
and
.SM DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
in turn.
.IP
Use the
.B \-L
option to 
.IR otool (1).
to discover the frameworks and shared libraries that the executable
is linked against.
.TP
.B DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain frameworks.
It is used as the default location for frameworks not found in their install
path.

By default, it is set to
/Library/Frameworks:/Network/Library/Frameworks:/System/Library/Frameworks
.TP
.B DYLD_VERSIONED_FRAMEWORK_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain potential override frameworks. 
The dynamic linker searches these directories for frameworks.  For
each framework found dyld looks at its LC_ID_DYLIB and gets the current_version 
and install name.  Dyld then looks for the framework at the install name path.
Whichever has the larger current_version value will be used in the process whenever
a framework with that install name is required.  This is similar to DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
except instead of always overriding, it only overrides is the supplied framework is newer.
Note: dyld does not check the framework's Info.plist to find its version.  Dyld only
checks the -currrent_version number supplied when the framework was created.
.TP
.B DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain libraries. The
dynamic linker searches these directories before it searches the default
locations for libraries. It allows you to test new versions of existing
libraries. 
.IP
For each library that a program uses, the dynamic linker looks for it in each
directory in 
.SM DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
in turn. If it still can't find the library, it then searches 
.SM DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH
and
.SM DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
in turn.
.IP
Use the
.B \-L
option to 
.IR otool (1).
to discover the frameworks and shared libraries that the executable
is linked against.
.TP
.B DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain libraries.
It is used as the default location for libraries not found in their install
path.
By default, it is set
to $(HOME)/lib:/usr/local/lib:/lib:/usr/lib.
.TP
.B DYLD_VERSIONED_LIBRARY_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories that contain potential override libraries. 
The dynamic linker searches these directories for dynamic libraries.  For
each library found dyld looks at its LC_ID_DYLIB and gets the current_version 
and install name.  Dyld then looks for the library at the install name path.
Whichever has the larger current_version value will be used in the process whenever
a dylib with that install name is required.  This is similar to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
except instead of always overriding, it only overrides is the supplied library is newer.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE
This is a path to a (writable) file. Normally, the dynamic linker writes all
logging output (triggered by DYLD_PRINT_* settings) to file descriptor 2 
(which is usually stderr).  But this setting causes the dynamic linker to
write logging output to the specified file.  
.TP
.B DYLD_ROOT_PATH
This is a colon separated list of directories.  The dynamic linker will prepend each of
this directory paths to every image access until a file is found.    
.TP
.B DYLD_SHARED_REGION 
This can be "use" (the default), "avoid", or "private".  Setting it to 
"avoid" tells dyld to not use the shared cache.  All OS dylibs are loaded 
dynamically just like every other dylib.  Setting it to "private" tells
dyld to remove the shared region from the process address space and mmap()
back in a private copy of the dyld shared cache in the shared region address
range. This is only useful if the shared cache on disk has been updated 
and is different than the shared cache in use.
.TP
.B DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
This is a colon separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the ones
specified in the program.  This lets you test new modules of existing dynamic
shared libraries that are used in flat-namespace images by loading a temporary
dynamic shared library with just the new modules.  Note that this has no
effect on images built a two-level namespace images using a dynamic shared
library unless
.SM DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE
is also used.
.TP
.B DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE
Force all images in the program to be linked as flat-namespace images and ignore
any two-level namespace bindings.  This may cause programs to fail to execute
with a multiply defined symbol error if two-level namespace images are used to
allow the images to have multiply defined symbols.
.TP
.B DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX
This is set to a string of a suffix to try to be used for all shared libraries
used by the program.  For libraries ending in ".dylib" the suffix is applied
just before the ".dylib".  For all other libraries the suffix is appended to the
library name.  This is useful for using conventional "_profile" and "_debug"
libraries and frameworks.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_OPTS
When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
standard error) the command line options.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_ENV
When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
standard error) the environment variables.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES
When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
standard error) the filenames of the libraries the program is using.
This is useful to make sure that the use of
.SM DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
is getting what you want.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES_POST_LAUNCH
This does the same as
.SM DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES
but the printing starts after the program gets to its entry point.
.TP
.B DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH
When this is set, the dynamic linker binds all undefined symbols
the program needs at launch time. This includes function symbols that can are normally 
lazily bound at the time of their first call.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS
Right before the process's main() is called, dyld prints out information about how
dyld spent its time.  Useful for analyzing launch performance.
.TP
.B DYLD_DISABLE_DOFS 
Causes dyld not register dtrace static probes with the kernel.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_INITIALIZERS
Causes dyld to print out a line when running each initializers in every image.  Initializers
run by dyld included constructors for C++ statically allocated objects, functions marked with
__attribute__((constructor)), and -init functions.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_APIS
Causes dyld to print a line whenever a dyld API is called (e.g. NSAddImage()).
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_SEGMENTS
Causes dyld to print out a line containing the name and address range of each mach-o segment
that dyld maps.  In addition it prints information about if the image was from the dyld 
shared cache.
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_BINDINGS 
Causes dyld to print a line each time a symbolic name is bound.  
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_DOFS 
Causes dyld to print out information about dtrace static probes registered with the kernel. 
.TP
.B DYLD_PRINT_RPATHS
Cause dyld  to print a line each time it expands an @rpath variable and whether
that expansion was successful or not.
.TP
.B DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR
This is a directory containing dyld shared cache files.  This variable can be used in
conjunction with DYLD_SHARED_REGION=private and DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DONT_VALIDATE
to run a process with an alternate shared cache.
.TP
.B DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DONT_VALIDATE
Causes dyld to not check that the inode and mod-time of files in the shared cache match
the requested dylib on disk. Thus a program can be made to run with the dylib in the
shared cache even though the real dylib has been updated on disk.
.TP
.SH DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING
Unlike many other operating systems, Darwin does not locate dependent dynamic libraries
via their leaf file name.  Instead the full path to each dylib is used (e.g. /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib).
But there are times when a full path is not appropriate; for instance, may want your
binaries to be installable in anywhere on the disk.
To support that, there are three @xxx/ variables that can be used as a path prefix.  At runtime dyld
substitutes a dynamically generated path for the @xxx/ prefix.
.TP
.B @executable_path/
This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the main executable for 
the process.  This is useful for loading dylibs/frameworks embedded in a .app directory. 
If the main executable file is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/MacOS/My and a framework dylib 
file is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo, then 
the framework load path could be encoded as 
@executable_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the .app directory could be
moved around in the file system and dyld will still be able to load the embedded framework.
.TP
.B @loader_path/
This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the mach-o binary which
contains the load command using @loader_path. Thus, in every binary, @loader_path resolves to
a different path, whereas @executable_path always resolves to the same path. @loader_path is
useful as the load path for a framework/dylib embedded in a plug-in, if the final file 
system location of the plugin-in unknown (so absolute paths cannot be used) or if the plug-in 
is used by multiple applications (so @executable_path cannot be used). If the plug-in mach-o
file is at /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Myfilter and a framework dylib 
file is at /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo, then 
the framework load path could be encoded as 
@loader_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the Myfilter.plugin directory could 
be moved around in the file system and dyld will still be able to load the embedded framework.
.TP
.B @rpath/
Dyld maintains a current stack of paths called the run path list.  When @rpath is encountered
it is substituted with each path in the run path list until a loadable dylib if found.  
The run path stack is built from the LC_RPATH load commands in the depencency chain
that lead to the current dylib load.
You can add an LC_RPATH load command to an image with the -rpath option to ld(1).  You can
even add a LC_RPATH load command path that starts with @loader_path/, and it will push a path
on the run path stack that relative to the image containing the LC_RPATH.  
The use of @rpath is most useful when you have a complex directory structure of programs and
dylibs which can be installed anywhere, but keep their relative positions.  This scenario
could be implemented using @loader_path, but every client of a dylib could need a different 
load path because its relative position in the file system is different. The use of @rpath
introduces a level of indirection that simplies things.  You pick a location in your directory
structure as an anchor point.  Each dylib then gets an install path that starts with @rpath 
and is the path to the dylib relative to the anchor point. Each main executable is linked
with -rpath @loader_path/zzz, where zzz is the path from the executable to the anchor point.
At runtime dyld sets it run path to be the anchor point, then each dylib is found relative
to the anchor point.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBec\fR command processes \s-1EC\s0 keys. They can be converted between various
forms and their components printed out. \fBNote\fR OpenSSL uses the 
private key format specified in '\s-1SEC 1:\s0 Elliptic Curve Cryptography'
(http://www.secg.org/). To convert a OpenSSL \s-1EC\s0 private key into the
PKCS#8 private key format use the \fBpkcs8\fR command.
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option with a private key uses
an \s-1ASN.1 DER\s0 encoded \s-1SEC1\s0 private key. When used with a public key it
uses the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structur as specified in \s-1RFC 3280.\s0
The \fB\s-1PEM\s0\fR form is the default format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64
encoded with additional header and footer lines. In the case of a private key
PKCS#8 format is also accepted.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be
prompted for.
.IP "\fB\-passin arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passin arg"
the input file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output by
is not specified. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be
prompted for. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same as the input
filename.
.IP "\fB\-passout arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-passout arg"
the output file password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-des|\-des3|\-idea\fR" 4
.IX Item "-des|-des3|-idea"
These options encrypt the private key with the \s-1DES,\s0 triple \s-1DES, IDEA\s0 or 
any other cipher supported by OpenSSL before outputting it. A pass phrase is
prompted for.
If none of these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This
means that using the \fBec\fR utility to read in an encrypted key with no
encryption option can be used to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by
setting the encryption options it can be use to add or change the pass phrase.
These options can only be used with \s-1PEM\s0 format output files.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
prints out the public, private key components and parameters.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
this option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.
.IP "\fB\-modulus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-modulus"
this option prints out the value of the public key component of the key.
.IP "\fB\-pubin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubin"
by default a private key is read from the input file: with this option a
public key is read instead.
.IP "\fB\-pubout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pubout"
by default a private key is output. With this option a public
key will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the input is
a public key.
.IP "\fB\-conv_form\fR" 4
.IX Item "-conv_form"
This specifies how the points on the elliptic curve are converted
into octet strings. Possible values are: \fBcompressed\fR (the default
value), \fBuncompressed\fR and \fBhybrid\fR. For more information regarding
the point conversion forms please read the X9.62 standard.
\&\fBNote\fR Due to patent issues the \fBcompressed\fR option is disabled
by default for binary curves and can be enabled by defining
the preprocessor macro \fB\s-1OPENSSL_EC_BIN_PT_COMP\s0\fR at compile time.
.IP "\fB\-param_enc arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-param_enc arg"
This specifies how the elliptic curve parameters are encoded.
Possible value are: \fBnamed_curve\fR, i.e. the ec parameters are
specified by a \s-1OID,\s0 or \fBexplicit\fR where the ec parameters are
explicitly given (see \s-1RFC 3279\s0 for the definition of the 
\&\s-1EC\s0 parameters structures). The default value is \fBnamed_curve\fR.
\&\fBNote\fR the \fBimplicitlyCA\fR alternative ,as specified in \s-1RFC 3279,\s0
is currently not implemented in OpenSSL.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm echo
.Nd write arguments to the standard output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar string ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
.Pq Ql "\ "
characters and followed by a newline
.Pq Ql \en
character, to the standard
output.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not print the trailing newline character.
This may also be achieved by appending
.Ql \ec
to the end of the string, as is done
by iBCS2 compatible systems.
Note that this option as well as the effect of
.Ql \ec
are implementation-defined in
.St -p1003.1-2001
as amended by Cor.\& 1-2002.
Applications aiming for maximum
portability are strongly encouraged to use
.Xr printf 1
to suppress the newline character.
.El
.Pp
Some shells may provide a builtin
.Nm
command which is similar or identical to this utility.
.\" 4874742
Most notably, the builtin
.Nm
in
.Xr sh 1
does not accept the
.Fl n
option.
.\" 4874742
Consult the
.Xr builtin 1
manual page.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr builtin 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001
as amended by Cor.\& 1-2002.

This command is used to manipulate or generate \s-1EC\s0 parameter files.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-inform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-inform DER|PEM"
This specifies the input format. The \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR option uses an \s-1ASN.1 DER\s0 encoded
form compatible with \s-1RFC 3279\s0 EcpkParameters. The \s-1PEM\s0 form is the default
format: it consists of the \fB\s-1DER\s0\fR format base64 encoded with additional 
header and footer lines.
.IP "\fB\-outform DER|PEM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-outform DER|PEM"
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
\&\fB\-inform\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or standard input if
this option is not specified.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
This specifies the output filename parameters to. Standard output is used
if this option is not present. The output filename should \fBnot\fR be the same
as the input filename.
.IP "\fB\-noout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noout"
This option inhibits the output of the encoded version of the parameters.
.IP "\fB\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-text"
This option prints out the \s-1EC\s0 parameters in human readable form.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
This option converts the \s-1EC\s0 parameters into C code. The parameters can then
be loaded by calling the \fB\f(BIget_ec_group_XXX()\fB\fR function.
.IP "\fB\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-check"
Validate the elliptic curve parameters.
.IP "\fB\-name arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-name arg"
Use the \s-1EC\s0 parameters with the specified 'short' name. Use \fB\-list_curves\fR
to get a list of all currently implemented \s-1EC\s0 parameters.
.IP "\fB\-list_curves\fR" 4
.IX Item "-list_curves"
If this options is specified \fBecparam\fR will print out a list of all
currently implemented \s-1EC\s0 parameters names and exit.
.IP "\fB\-conv_form\fR" 4
.IX Item "-conv_form"
This specifies how the points on the elliptic curve are converted
into octet strings. Possible values are: \fBcompressed\fR (the default
value), \fBuncompressed\fR and \fBhybrid\fR. For more information regarding
the point conversion forms please read the X9.62 standard.
\&\fBNote\fR Due to patent issues the \fBcompressed\fR option is disabled
by default for binary curves and can be enabled by defining
the preprocessor macro \fB\s-1OPENSSL_EC_BIN_PT_COMP\s0\fR at compile time.
.IP "\fB\-param_enc arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-param_enc arg"
This specifies how the elliptic curve parameters are encoded.
Possible value are: \fBnamed_curve\fR, i.e. the ec parameters are
specified by a \s-1OID,\s0 or \fBexplicit\fR where the ec parameters are
explicitly given (see \s-1RFC 3279\s0 for the definition of the 
\&\s-1EC\s0 parameters structures). The default value is \fBnamed_curve\fR.
\&\fBNote\fR the \fBimplicitlyCA\fR alternative ,as specified in \s-1RFC 3279,\s0
is currently not implemented in OpenSSL.
.IP "\fB\-no_seed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_seed"
This option inhibits that the 'seed' for the parameter generation
is included in the ECParameters structure (see \s-1RFC 3279\s0).
.IP "\fB\-genkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "-genkey"
This option will generate a \s-1EC\s0 private key using the specified parameters.
.IP "\fB\-rand file(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rand file(s)"
a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an \s-1EGD\s0 socket (see \fIRAND_egd\fR\|(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.
The separator is \fB;\fR for MS-Windows, \fB,\fR for OpenVMS, and \fB:\fR for
all others.
.IP "\fB\-engine id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-engine id"
specifying an engine (by it's unique \fBid\fR string) will cause \fBreq\fR
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ed ,
.Nm red
.Nd text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl
.Op Fl sx
.Op Fl p Ar string
.Op Ar file
.Nm red
.Op Fl
.Op Fl sx
.Op Fl p Ar string
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a line-oriented text editor.
It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text
files.
When invoked as
.Nm red ,
the editor runs in
.Qq restricted
mode, in which the only difference is that the editor restricts the
use of filenames which start with
.Ql \&!
(interpreted as shell commands by
.Nm )
or contain a
.Ql \&/ .
Note that editing outside of the current directory is only prohibited
if the user does not have write access to the current directory.
If a user has write access to the current directory, then symbolic
links can be created in the current directory, in which case
.Nm red
will not stop the user from editing the file that the symbolic link
points to.
.Pp
If invoked with a
.Ar file
argument, then a copy of
.Ar file
is read into the editor's buffer.
Changes are made to this copy and not directly to
.Ar file
itself.
Upon quitting
.Nm ,
any changes not explicitly saved with a
.Em w
command are lost.
.Pp
Editing is done in two distinct modes:
.Em command
and
.Em input .
When first invoked,
.Nm
is in command mode.
In this mode commands are read from the standard input and
executed to manipulate the contents of the editor buffer.
A typical command might look like:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Cm ,s No / Em old Xo
.No / Em new
.No / Cm g
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
which replaces all occurrences of the string
.Em old
with
.Em new .
.Pp
When an input command, such as
.Em a
(append),
.Em i
(insert) or
.Em c
(change), is given,
.Nm
enters input mode.
This is the primary means
of adding text to a file.
In this mode, no commands are available;
instead, the standard input is written
directly to the editor buffer.
Lines consist of text up to and
including a
.Em newline
character.
Input mode is terminated by
entering a single period
.Pq Em .\&
on a line.
.Pp
All
.Nm
commands operate on whole lines or ranges of lines; e.g.,
the
.Em d
command deletes lines; the
.Em m
command moves lines, and so on.
It is possible to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement,
as in the example above.
However even here, the
.Em s
command is applied to whole lines at a time.
.Pp
In general,
.Nm
commands consist of zero or more line addresses, followed by a single
character command and possibly additional parameters; i.e.,
commands have the structure:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Xo
.Op Ar address Op , Ar address
.Ar command Op Ar parameters
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to be affected by the
command.
If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts, then
default addresses are supplied.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s
Suppress diagnostics.
This should be used if
.Nm Ns 's
standard input is from a script.
.It Fl x
Prompt for an encryption key to be used in subsequent reads and writes
(see the
.Em x
command).
Unsupported on Mac OS X.
.It Fl p Ar string
Specify a command prompt.
This may be toggled on and off with the
.Em P
command.
.It Ar file
Specify the name of a file to read.
If
.Ar file
is prefixed with a
bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell command.
In this case,
what is read is
the standard output of
.Ar file
executed via
.Xr sh 1 .
To read a file whose name begins with a bang, prefix the
name with a backslash (\\).
The default filename is set to
.Ar file
only if it is not prefixed with a bang.
.El
.Sh LINE ADDRESSING
An address represents the number of a line in the buffer.
The
.Nm
utility maintains a
.Em current address
which is
typically supplied to commands as the default address when none is specified.
When a file is first read, the current address is set to the last line
of the file.
In general, the current address is set to the last line
affected by a command.
.Pp
A line address is
constructed from one of the bases in the list below, optionally followed
by a numeric offset.
The offset may include any combination
of digits, operators (i.e.,
.Em + ,
.Em -
and
.Em ^ )
and whitespace.
Addresses are read from left to right, and their values are computed
relative to the current address.
.Pp
One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is the
address
.Em 0
(zero).
This means "before the first line,"
and is legal wherever it makes sense.
.Pp
An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or
semi-colon.
The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the
value of the second.
If only one address is given in a range, then
the second address is set to the given address.
If an
.Em n Ns -tuple
of addresses is given where
.Em "n\ >\ 2" ,
then the corresponding range is determined by the last two addresses in
the
.Em n Ns -tuple .
If only one address is expected, then the last address is used.
.Pp
Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted relative to the
current address.
In a semi-colon-delimited range, the first address is
used to set the current address, and the second address is interpreted
relative to the first.
.Pp
The following address symbols are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It .
The current line (address) in the buffer.
.It $
The last line in the buffer.
.It n
The
.Em n Ns th,
line in the buffer
where
.Em n
is a number in the range
.Em [0,$] .
.It - or ^
The previous line.
This is equivalent to
.Em -1
and may be repeated with cumulative effect.
.It -n or ^n
The
.Em n Ns th
previous line, where
.Em n
is a non-negative number.
.It +
The next line.
This is equivalent to
.Em +1
and may be repeated with cumulative effect.
.It +n
The
.Em n Ns th
next line, where
.Em n
is a non-negative number.
.It , or %
The first through last lines in the buffer.
This is equivalent to
the address range
.Em 1,$ .
.It ;
The current through last lines in the buffer.
This is equivalent to
the address range
.Em .,$ .
.It /re/
The next line containing the regular expression
.Em re .
The search wraps to the beginning of the buffer and continues down to the
current line, if necessary.
// repeats the last search.
.It ?re?
The
previous line containing the regular expression
.Em re .
The search wraps to the end of the buffer and continues up to the
current line, if necessary.
?? repeats the last search.
.It 'lc
The
line previously marked by a
.Em k
(mark) command, where
.Em lc
is a lower case letter.
.El
.Sh REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
Regular expressions are patterns used in selecting text.
For example, the command:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Cm g No / Em string Xo
.No /
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
prints all lines containing
.Em string .
Regular expressions are also
used by the
.Em s
command for selecting old text to be replaced with new.
.Pp
In addition to a specifying string literals, regular expressions can
represent
classes of strings.
Strings thus represented are said to be matched
by the corresponding regular expression.
If it is possible for a regular expression
to match several strings in a line, then the left-most longest match is
the one selected.
.Pp
The following symbols are used in constructing regular expressions:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It c
Any character
.Em c
not listed below, including
.Ql \&{ ,
.Ql \&} ,
.Ql \&( ,
.Ql \&) ,
.Ql <
and
.Ql > ,
matches itself.
.It Pf \e c
Any backslash-escaped character
.Em c ,
except for
.Ql \&{ ,
.Ql \&} ,
.Ql \&( ,
.Ql \&) ,
.Ql <
and
.Ql > ,
matches itself.
.It .
Match any single character.
.It Op char-class
Match any single character in
.Em char-class .
To include a
.Ql \&]
in
.Em char-class ,
it must be the first character.
A range of characters may be specified by separating the end characters
of the range with a
.Ql - ,
e.g.,
.Ql a-z
specifies the lower case characters.
The following literal expressions can also be used in
.Em char-class
to specify sets of characters:
.Pp
.Bl -column "[:alnum:]" "[:cntrl:]" "[:lower:]" "[:xdigit:]" -compact
.It [:alnum:] Ta [:cntrl:] Ta [:lower:] Ta [:space:]
.It [:alpha:] Ta [:digit:] Ta [:print:] Ta [:upper:]
.It [:blank:] Ta [:graph:] Ta [:punct:] Ta [:xdigit:]
.El
.Pp
If
.Ql -
appears as the first or last
character of
.Em char-class ,
then it matches itself.
All other characters in
.Em char-class
match themselves.
.Pp
Patterns in
.Em char-class
of the form:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset 2n
.It
.Op \&. Ns Ar col-elm Ns .\&
or,
.It
.Op = Ns Ar col-elm Ns =
.El
.Pp
where
.Ar col-elm
is a
.Em collating element
are interpreted according to the current locale settings
(not currently supported).
See
.Xr regex 3
and
.Xr re_format 7
for an explanation of these constructs.
.It Op ^char-class
Match any single character, other than newline, not in
.Em char-class .
.Em Char-class
is defined
as above.
.It ^
If
.Em ^
is the first character of a regular expression, then it
anchors the regular expression to the beginning of a line.
Otherwise, it matches itself.
.It $
If
.Em $
is the last character of a regular expression, it
anchors the regular expression to the end of a line.
Otherwise, it matches itself.
.It Pf \e <
Anchor the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately following it to the beginning of a word.
(This may not be available)
.It Pf \e >
Anchor the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately following it to the end of a word.
(This may not be available)
.It Pf \e (re\e)
Define a subexpression
.Em re .
Subexpressions may be nested.
A subsequent backreference of the form
.Pf \e Em n ,
where
.Em n
is a number in the range [1,9], expands to the text matched by the
.Em n Ns th
subexpression.
For example, the regular expression
.Ql \e(.*\e)\e1
matches any string
consisting of identical adjacent substrings.
Subexpressions are ordered relative to
their left delimiter.
.It *
Match the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately preceding it zero or more times.
If
.Em *
is the first
character of a regular expression or subexpression, then it matches
itself.
The
.Em *
operator sometimes yields unexpected results.
For example, the regular expression
.Ql b*
matches the beginning of
the string
.Ql abbb
(as opposed to the substring
.Ql bbb ) ,
since a null match
is the only left-most match.
.It \e{n,m\e} or \e{n,\e} or \e{n\e}
Match the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately preceding it at least
.Em n
and at most
.Em m
times.
If
.Em m
is omitted, then it matches at least
.Em n
times.
If the comma is also omitted, then it matches exactly
.Em n
times.
.El
.Pp
Additional regular expression operators may be defined depending on the
particular
.Xr regex 3
implementation.
.Sh COMMANDS
All
.Nm
commands are single characters, though some require additional parameters.
If a command's parameters extend over several lines, then
each line except for the last
must be terminated with a backslash (\\).
.Pp
In general, at most one command is allowed per line.
However, most commands accept a print suffix, which is any of
.Em p
(print),
.Em l
(list),
or
.Em n
(enumerate),
to print the last line affected by the command.
.Pp
An interrupt (typically ^C) has the effect of aborting the current command
and returning the editor to command mode.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
recognizes the following commands.
The commands are shown together with
the default address or address range supplied if none is
specified (in parenthesis).
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It (.)a
Append text to the buffer after the addressed line.
Text is entered in input mode.
The current address is set to last line entered.
.It (.,.)c
Change lines in the buffer.
The addressed lines are deleted
from the buffer, and text is appended in their place.
Text is entered in input mode.
The current address is set to last line entered.
.It (.,.)d
Delete the addressed lines from the buffer.
If there is a line after the deleted range, then the current address is set
to this line.
Otherwise the current address is set to the line
before the deleted range.
.It e Ar file
Edit
.Ar file ,
and sets the default filename.
If
.Ar file
is not specified, then the default filename is used.
Any lines in the buffer are deleted before
the new file is read.
The current address is set to the last line read.
.It e Ar !command
Edit the standard output of
.Ar !command ,
(see
.Ar !command
below).
The default filename is unchanged.
Any lines in the buffer are deleted before the output of
.Ar command
is read.
The current address is set to the last line read.
.It E Ar file
Edit
.Ar file
unconditionally.
This is similar to the
.Em e
command,
except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning.
The current address is set to the last line read.
.It f Ar file
Set the default filename to
.Ar file .
If
.Ar file
is not specified, then the default unescaped filename is printed.
.It (1,$)g/re/command-list
Apply
.Ar command-list
to each of the addressed lines matching a regular expression
.Ar re .
The current address is set to the
line currently matched before
.Ar command-list
is executed.
At the end of the
.Em g
command, the current address is set to the last line affected by
.Ar command-list .
.Pp
Each command in
.Ar command-list
must be on a separate line,
and every line except for the last must be terminated by a backslash
(\\).
Any commands are allowed, except for
.Em g ,
.Em G ,
.Em v ,
and
.Em V .
A newline alone in
.Ar command-list
is equivalent to a
.Em p
command.
.It (1,$)G/re/
Interactively edit the addressed lines matching a regular expression
.Ar re .
For each matching line,
the line is printed,
the current address is set,
and the user is prompted to enter a
.Ar command-list .
At the end of the
.Em G
command, the current address
is set to the last line affected by (the last)
.Ar command-list .
.Pp
The format of
.Ar command-list
is the same as that of the
.Em g
command.
A newline alone acts as a null command list.
A single
.Ql &
repeats the last non-null command list.
.It H
Toggle the printing of error explanations.
By default, explanations are not printed.
It is recommended that ed scripts begin with this command to
aid in debugging.
.It h
Print an explanation of the last error.
.It (.)i
Insert text in the buffer before the current line.
Text is entered in input mode.
The current address is set to the last line entered.
.It (.,.+1)j
Join the addressed lines.
The addressed lines are
deleted from the buffer and replaced by a single
line containing their joined text.
The current address is set to the resultant line.
.It (.)klc
Mark a line with a lower case letter
.Em lc .
The line can then be addressed as
.Em 'lc
(i.e., a single quote followed by
.Em lc )
in subsequent commands.
The mark is not cleared until the line is
deleted or otherwise modified.
.It (.,.)l
Print the addressed lines unambiguously.
If a single line fills for than one screen (as might be the case
when viewing a binary file, for instance), a
.Dq Li --More--
prompt is printed on the last line.
The
.Nm
utility waits until the RETURN key is pressed
before displaying the next screen.
The current address is set to the last line
printed.
.It (.,.)m(.)
Move lines in the buffer.
The addressed lines are moved to after the
right-hand destination address, which may be the address
.Em 0
(zero).
The current address is set to the
last line moved.
.It (.,.)n
Print the addressed lines along with
their line numbers.
The current address is set to the last line
printed.
.It (.,.)p
Print the addressed lines.
The current address is set to the last line

This is similar to the
.Em q
command,
except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning.
.It ($)r Ar file
Read
.Ar file
to after the addressed line.
If
.Ar file
is not specified, then the default
filename is used.
If there was no default filename prior to the command,
then the default filename is set to
.Ar file .
Otherwise, the default filename is unchanged.
The current address is set to the last line read.
.It ($)r Ar !command
Read
to after the addressed line
the standard output of
.Ar !command ,
(see the
.Ar !command
below).
The default filename is unchanged.
The current address is set to the last line read.

.It (.,.)s/re/replacement/g
.It (.,.)s/re/replacement/n
Replace text in the addressed lines
matching a regular expression
.Ar re
with
.Ar replacement .
By default, only the first match in each line is replaced.
If the
.Em g
(global) suffix is given, then every match to be replaced.
The
.Em n
suffix, where
.Em n
is a positive number, causes only the
.Em n Ns th
match to be replaced.
It is an error if no substitutions are performed on any of the addressed
lines.
The current address is set the last line affected.
.Pp
.Ar Re
and
.Ar replacement
may be delimited by any character other than space and newline
(see the
.Em s
command below).
If one or two of the last delimiters is omitted, then the last line
affected is printed as though the print suffix
.Em p
were specified.
.Pp
An unescaped
.Ql &

.Ar replacement
is replaced by the currently matched text.
The character sequence
.Em \em ,
where
.Em m
is a number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the
.Em m th
backreference expression of the matched text.
If
.Ar replacement

The current address is set to the last line printed.
.It !command
Execute
.Ar command
via
.Xr sh 1 .
If the first character of
.Ar command
is
.Ql \&! ,
then it is replaced by text of the
previous
.Ar !command .
The
.Nm
utility does not process
.Ar command
for backslash (\\) escapes.
However, an unescaped
.Em %
is replaced by the default filename.
When the shell returns from execution, a
.Ql \&!
is printed to the standard output.
The current line is unchanged.
.It ($)=
Print the line number of the addressed line.
.It (.+1)newline

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
When an error occurs,
.Nm
prints a
.Ql \&?
and either returns to command mode
or exits if its input is from a script.
An explanation of the last error can be
printed with the
.Em h
(help) command.
.Pp
Since the
.Em g
(global) command masks any errors from failed searches and substitutions,
it can be used to perform conditional operations in scripts; e.g.,
.Pp
.Sm off
.Cm g No / Em old Xo
.No / Cm s
.No // Em new
.No /
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
replaces any occurrences of
.Em old
with
.Em new .
If the
.Em u
(undo) command occurs in a global command list, then
the command list is executed only once.
.Pp
If diagnostics are not disabled, attempting to quit
.Nm
or edit another file before writing a modified buffer
results in an error.
If the command is entered a second time, it succeeds,
but any changes to the buffer are lost.

.SH NAME
efax \- send/receive faxes with Class 1, 2 or 2.0 fax modem

.ce 1
(Please read the \fBfax\fP man page first.)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B efax
[
\fIoptions\fP
]
[
\fB-t\fP \fInum\fP [ \fIfile\fP... ]
]

.SH OPTIONS
Where \fIoptions\fP are:

.TP 9
.B -a \fIcmd\fP
use the command \fBATcmd\fP when answering the phone.  The
default is "A".

.TP 9
.B -c \fIcaps\fP
set the local modem capabilities.  See the section on
capabilities below for the format and meaning of \fIcaps\fP.  For
Class 1 the default is 1,n,0,2,0,0,0,0 where n is the highest
speed supported by the modem.  For Class 2 the default is
determined by the modem.

.TP 9 
.B -d \fIdev\fP 
use the fax modem connected to device \fIdev\fP.  The default is
\fB/dev/modem\fP.  

.TP 9
.B -f \fIfnt\fP
use font file \fIfnt\fP for generating the header.  The default
is a built-in 8x16 font.  See the efix(1) -f option for the font
file format.

.TP 9
.B -g \fIcmd\fP
if a \fBCONNECT\fP (or \fBDATA\fP) response indicates a data
call, the shell \fB/bin/sh\fP is exec(2)'ed with \fIcmd\fP as its
command.  \fIcmd\fP is a printf(3) format that may contain up to
6 %d escapes which are replaced by the baud rate following the
most recent \fBCONNECT\fP message. \fIcmd\fP typically exec's
getty(8).

.TP 9
.B -h \fIhdr\fP
put string `hdr' at the top of each page.  The first %d in `hdr'
is replaced by the page number and the second, if any, is
replaced by the number of pages being sent.

.TP 9
.B -i \fIstr\fP
.TP 9
.B -j \fIstr\fP
.TP 9
.B -k \fIstr\fP
send the command \fBAT\fP\fIstr\fP to the modem to initialize it.
-i commands are sent before the modem is put into fax mode, -j
commands after the modem is in fax mode, and -k commands just
before efax exits.  The only default is a hang-up (ATH) command
that is sent before exiting only if no other -k options are
given.  Multiple options may be used.

.TP 9
.B -l \fIid\fP
set the local identification string to \fIid\fP.  \fIid\fP should
be the local telephone number in international format (for
example "+1 800 555-1212").  This is passed to the remote fax
machine.  Some fax machines may not accept characters other than
numbers, space, and '+'.  

.TP 9 
.B -o \fIopt\fP 
use option \fIopt\fP to accommodate a non-standard fax modem
protocol.  See the MODEM REQUIREMENTS section below for more
details.  The \fIopt\fPions are:

.TP 9
.B 
    0
Force use of Class 2.0 fax modem commands.  The modem must
support Class 2.0.

.TP 9
.B 
    2
Force use of Class 2 fax modem commands.  The modem must support
Class 2.

.TP 9
.B 
    1 
Force use of Class 1 fax modem commands. The modem must support
Class 1.  By default efax queries the modem and uses the first of
the three above classes which is supported by the modem.

.TP 9
.B 
    a
use software adaptive answer method.  If the first attempt to
answer the call does not result in a data connection within 8
seconds the phone is hung up temporarily and answered again in
fax mode (see "Accepting both fax and data calls" below).

.TP 9
.B 
    e 
ignore errors in modem initialization commands.

.TP 9
.B 
    f
use "virtual flow control".  efax tries to estimate the number of
bytes in the modem's transmit buffer and pauses as necessary to
avoid filling it.  The modem's buffer is assumed to hold at least
96 bytes.  This feature does not work properly with Class 2
modems that add redundant padding to scan lines.  Use this option
only if you have problems configuring flow control.

.TP 9
.B 
    h 
use hardware (RTS/CTS) in addition to software (XON/XOFF) flow
control.  Many modems will stop responding if this option is
used.  See the section `Resolving Problems' before using this
option.

.TP 9
.B 
    l
halve the time between testing lock files when waiting for other
programs to complete.  By default this is 8 seconds. For example
-olll sets the interval to 1 second.

.TP 9
.B 
    n
ignore requests for pages to be retransmitted. Use this option if
you don't care about the quality of the received fax or if the
receiving machine is too fussy.  Otherwise each page may be
retransmitted up to 3 times.

.TP 9
.B 
    r
do not reverse bit order during data reception for Class 2
modems.  Only Multitech modems require this option. Not normally
required since efax detects these modems.

.TP 9
.B 
    x
send XON (DC1) instead of DC2 to start data reception.  Applies
to a very few Class 2 modems only.

.TP 9
.B 
    z
delay an additional 100 milliseconds before each modem
initialization or reset command.  The initial delay is 100
ms. For example, -ozzz produces a 400 ms delay.  Use with modems
that get confused when commands arrive too quickly.


.TP 9
.B -q \fIn\fP
ask for retransmission of pages received with more than \fIn\fP
errors.  Default is 10.

.TP 9
.B -r \fIpat\fP
each received fax page is stored in a separate file.  The file
name is created using \fIpat\fP as a strftime(3) format string.
A page number of the form .001, .002, ...  is appended to the
file name.  If \fIpat\fP is blank ("") or no -r option is given a
default string of "%m%d%H%M%S" is used.

.\" If a file already exists, efax terminates with an error.

.TP 9
.B -s
remove lock file(s) after initializing the modem.  This allows
outgoing calls to proceed when efax is waiting for an incoming
call.  If efax detects modem activity it will attempt to re-lock
the device.  If the modem has been locked by the other program
efax will exit and return 1 (``busy'').  Normally a new efax
process is then started by launchd(8). The new efax process will
then check periodically until the lock file disappears and
then re-initialize the modem.

.TP 9 
.B -t \fInum [file\fP...]  
dial telephone number \fInum\fP and send the fax image files
\fIfile\fP....  If used, this must be the last argument on the
command line.  The telephone number \fInum\fP is a string that
may contain any dial modifiers that the modem supports such as a
T prefix for tone dialing or commas for delays.  If no file names
are given the remote fax machine will be polled. If no -t
argument is given efax will answer the phone and attempt to
receive a fax.

.TP 9
.B -v \fIstrng\fP
select types of messages to be printed.  Each \fIlower-case\fP
letter in \fIstrng\fP enables one type of message:

.RS 12
.B
e - 
errors
.br
.B
w - 
warnings
.br
.B
i -

.br
.B
n -

.br
.B
x -

.RE
.RS 9
Up to two -v options may be used.  The first is for messages
printed to the standard error and the second is for messages to
the standard output. The default is "ewin" to the standard error
only.
.RE

.TP 9
.B -w
wait for an OK or CONNECT prompt instead of issuing an answer
(\fBATA\fP) command to receive a fax.  Use this option when the
modem is set to auto-answer (using S0=\fIn\fP) or if another
program has already answered the call.

.TP 9
.B -x \fIlkf\fP
use a UUCP-style lock file \fIlkf\fP to lock the modem device
before opening it.  If the device is locked, efax checks every 15
seconds until it is free.  Up to 16 -x options may be used if
there are several names for the same device.  A `#' prefix on the
file name creates an binary rather than text (HDB-style) lock
file.  This is the reverse of what was used by previous efax
versions.

.SH FAX FILE FORMATS

efax can read the same types of files as \fBefix(1)\fP including
text, T.4 (Group 3), PBM, single- and multi-page TIFF (G3 and
uncompressed).  efax automatically determines the type of file
from its contents.  TIFF files are recommended as they contain
information about the image size and resolution.

Each page to be sent should be converted to a separate TIFF
format file with Group 3 (G3) compression.  Received files are
also stored in this format.  The EXAMPLES section below shows how
efix and other programs can be used to create, view and print
these files.

.SH OPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The operating system must provide short response times to avoid
protocol timeouts.  For Class 2 and 2.0 modems the delay should
not exceed 1 or 2 seconds.

When using Class 1 modems the program must respond to certain
events within 55 milliseconds.  Longer delays may cause the fax
protocol to fail in certain places (between DCS and TCF or
between RTC and MPS).  Class 1 modems should therefore not be
used on systems that cannot guarantee that the program will
respond to incoming data in less than 55 milliseconds.  In
particular, some intelligent serial cards and terminal servers
may introduce enough delay to cause problems with Class 1
operation.

The operating system must also provide sufficient low-level
buffering to allow uninterrupted transfer of data between the
modem and a disk file at the selected baud rate, typically 9600
bps.  Since the fax protocol does not provide end-to-end flow
control the effectiveness of flow control while receiving is
limited by the size of the modem's buffer. This can be less than
100 bytes.  Efax does not use flow control during reception.

.SH MODEM REQUIREMENTS

The "Group" is the protocol used to send faxes between fax
machines.  Efax supports the Group 3 protocol used over the
public telephone network.

The "Class" is the protocol used by computers to control fax
modems.  Efax supports Class 1, 2 and 2.0 fax modems.

Most fax modems use XON/XOFF flow control when in fax mode.  This
type of flow control adds very little overhead for fax use. Many
modems have unreliable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control in fax
mode.  By default efax enables only XON/XOFF flow control and the
-oh option must be used to add hardware flow control.

While some modems have serial buffers of about 1k bytes, many
inexpensive modems have buffers of about one hundred bytes and
are thus more likely to suffer overruns when sending faxes.

A few older modems may need a delay between commands of more than
the default value used by efax (100 milliseconds).  If the delay
is too short, commands may not echo properly, may time out, or
may give inconsistent responses.  Use one or more \fB-oz\fP
options to increase the delay between modem initialization
commands and use the E0 modem initialization command to disable
echoing of modem commands.

By default efax sends DC2 to start the data flow from the modem
when receiving faxes from Class 2 modems.  A few older modems
require XON instead.  Use of DC2 would cause the modem to give an
error message and/or the program to time out.  The \fB-ox\fP
option should be used in this case.

A few older Class 2 modems (e.g. some Intel models) don't send
DC2 or XON to start the data flow to the modem when sending
faxes.  After waiting 2 seconds efax will print a warning and
start sending anyways.

A very few Class 2 modems do not reverse the bit order (MSB to
LSB) by default on receive.  This might cause errors when trying
to display or print the received files.  The \fB-or\fP option can
be used in this case.

Some inexpensive "9600 bps" fax modems only \fItransmit\fP at
9600 bps and reception is limited to 4800 bps.

.SH MODEM INITIALIZATION OPTIONS

The required modem initialization commands are generated by efax.
Additional commands may be supplied as command-line arguments.
The modem must be set up to issue verbose(text) result codes.
The following command does this and is sent by efax before trying
to initialize the modem.

.TP 9
.BR Q0V1
respond to commands with verbose result codes

.PP
The following commands may be useful for special purposes:

.TP 9 
.BR X3 
don't wait for dial tone before dialing.  This may be used to
send a fax when the call has already been dialed manually.  In
this case use an empty string ("") as the first argument to the
\fB-t\fP command.  Use \fBX4\fP (usual default) to enable all
result codes.

.TP 9 
.BR M2
leave the monitor speaker turned on for the duration of the call
(use \fBM0\fP to leave it off).

.TP 9 
.BR L0
turn monitor speaker volume to minimum (use \fBL3\fP for maximum).

.TP 9 
.BR E0 
disable echoing of modem commands.  See the Resolving Problems
section below.

.TP 9 
.BR &D2
returns the modem to command mode when DTR is dropped.  The
program drops DTR at the start and end of the call if it can't
get a response to a modem command.  You can use \fB&D3\fP to
reset the modem when DTR is dropped.

.TP 9
.BR S7=120
wait up to two minutes (120 seconds) for carrier.  This may be
useful if the answering fax machine takes a long time to start
the handshaking operation (e.g. a combined fax/answering machine
with a long announcement).

.SH CAPABILITIES

The capabilities of the local hardware and software can be set
using a string of 8 digits separated by commas:

.BR  \fIvr\fP,\fIbr\fP,\fIwd\fP,\fIln\fP,\fIdf\fP,\fIec\fP,\fIbf\fP,\fIst\fP

where:

.TP 9
.I vr \fP (vertical resolution) =

.PP

When \fIreceiving\fP a fax the \fIvr\fP, \fIwd\fP, and \fIln\fP
fields of the capability string should be set to the maximum
values that your display software supports.  The default is 196
lpi, standard (8.5"/21.5cm) width and unlimited length.

When \fIsending\fP a fax efax will determine \fIvr\fP and
\fIln\fP from the image file and set \fIwd\fP to the default.

If the receiving fax machine does not support high resolution
(\fIvr\fP=1) mode, efax will reduce the resolution by combining
pairs of scan lines.  If the receiving fax machine does not
support the image's width then efax will truncate or pad as
required. Most fax machines can receive \fIln\fP up to 2.  Few
machines support values of \fIwd\fP other than 0.


.SH HEADERS

efax adds blank scan lines at the top of each image when it is
sent.  This allows room for the page header but increases the
length of the image (by default about 0.1" or 2.5mm of blank
space is added).

The header placed in this area typically includes the date and
time, identifies the, and shows the page number and total pages.
Headers cannot be disabled but the header string can be set to a
blank line.

The default font for generating the headers is the built-in 8x16
pixel font scaled to 12x24 pixels (about 9 point size).

Note that both efax and efix have -f options to specify the font.
efIx uses the font to generate text when doing text-to-fax
conversions (during "fax make") while efAx uses the font to
generate the header (during "fax send").

.SH SESSION LOG

A session log is written to the standard error stream.  This log
gives status and error messages from the program as selected by
the \fB-v\fP option. A time stamp showing the full time or just
minutes and seconds is printed before each message.  Times
printed along with modem responses also show milliseconds.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The program returns an error code as follows:

.TP 9
0
The fax was successfully sent or received.

.TP 9
1
The dialed number was busy or the modem device was in use.  Try
again later.

.TP 9
2
Something failed (e.g. file not found or disk full). Don't retry.
Check the session log for more details.

.TP 9
3 
Modem protocol error.  The program did not receive the expected
response from the modem.  The modem may not have been properly
initialized, the correct \fB-o\fP options were not used, or a bug
report may be in order.  Check the session log for more details.

.TP 9
4
The modem is not responding.  Operator attention is required.
Check that the modem is turned on and connected to the correct
port.

.TP 9
5
The program was terminated by a signal.

.TP 9
6
The program was terminated due to a system power event (i.e. the computer is about to sleep).

.TP 9
7
The operator canceled the call.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B Creating fax (G3) files

The efix program can be used to convert text files to TIFF-G3
format.  For example, the following command will convert the text
file \fBletter\fP to the files \fBletter.001\fP,
\fBletter.002\fP, etc,:

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efix -nletter.%03d letter
.ft P
.fi
.LP

Ghostscript's \fBtiffg3\fP driver can generate fax files in
TIFF-G3 format from postscript files.  For example, the command:

.IP
.nf
\f(CW gs -q -sDEVICE=tiffg3 -dNOPAUSE \\
	-sOutputFile=letter.%03d letter.ps </dev/null\fP
.fi
.LP

will convert the Postscript file
.BR letter.ps
into high-resolution
(\fIvr\fP=1) G3 fax image files \fBletter.001, letter.002,\fP ...

The images should have margins of at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) since
the fax standard only requires that fax machines print a central
portion of the image 196.6mm (7.7 inches) wide by 281.5mm (11.1
inches) high.

The efix program can also insert bitmaps in images to create
letterhead, signatures, etc.

.B Printing fax files

On CUPS based systems you can use lpr(1) to print faxes. For example, to 
print the received fax file \fBreply.001\fP use the command:

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
lpr reply.001
.ft P
.fi
.LP

On lpd based systems you can use the efix program to print faxes on Postscript or
HP-PCL (LaserJet) printers.  For example, to print the received
fax file \fBreply.001\fP on a Postscript printer use the command:

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efix -ops reply.001 | lpr
.ft P
.fi
.LP

.B Sending fax files

The following command will dial the number 222-2222 using tone
dialing and send a two-page fax from the TIFF-G3 files letter.001
and letter.002 using the fax modem connected to device /dev/cua1.

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efax -d /dev/cua1 \\
     -t T222-2222 letter.001 letter.002
.ft P
.fi
.LP

.B Manual answer

You can use efax to answer the phone immediately and start fax
reception.  Use this mode if you need to answer calls manually to
see if they are fax or voice.

For example, the following command will make the fax modem on
device \fB/dev/ttyS1\fP answer the phone and attempt to receive a
fax.  The received fax will be stored in the files
\fBreply.001\fP, \fBreply.002\fP, and so on.  The modem will
identify itself as "555-1212" and receive faxes at high or low
resolution (\fIvr\fP=1), at up to 14.4 kbps (\fIbr\fP=5).

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efax -d /dev/ttyS1 -l "555-1212" \\
   -c 1,5 -r reply
.ft P
.fi
.LP

.B Automatic answer

The \fB-w\fP option makes efax wait for characters to become
available from the modem (indicating an incoming call) before
starting fax reception.  Use the \fB-w\fP option and a
\fB-i\fPS0=\fIn\fP option to answer the phone after \fIn\fP
rings.  The example below will make the modem answer incoming
calls in fax mode on the fourth ring and save the received faxes
using files names corresponding to the reception date and time.

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efax -d /dev/ttyb -w -iS0=4 2>&1 >> fax.log
.ft P
.fi
.LP

.B Sharing the modem with outgoing calls

The modem device can be shared by programs that use the UUCP
device locking protocol.  This includes pppd, chat, minicom,
kermit, uucico, efax, cu, and many others others.  However,
locking will only work if all programs use the same lock file.

efax will lock the modem device before opening it if one or more
UUCP lock file names are given with \fB-x\fP options.  Most
programs place their lock files in the \fR/usr/spool/uucp\fP or
\fR/var/lock\fP directories and use the name \fRLCK..\fP\fIdev\fP
where \fIdev\fP is the name of the device file in the /dev
directory that is to be locked.

If the \fB-s\fP (share) option is used, the lock file is removed
while waiting for incoming calls so other programs can use the
same device.

If efax detects another program using the modem while it is
waiting to receive a fax, efax exits with a termination code of
1.  A subsequent efax process using this device will wait until
the other program is finished before re-initializing the modem
and starting to wait for incoming calls again.

Programs that try to lock the modem device by using device
locking facilities other than UUCP lock files not be able to use
this arbitration mechanism because the device will still be open
to the efax process.  In this case you will need to kill the efax
process (e.g. "fax stop") before starting the other program.

When efax is waiting for a fax it leaves the modem ready to
receive in fax mode but removes the lock file.  When a slip or
PPP program takes over the modem port by setting up its own lock
file efax cannot send any more commands to the modem -- not even
to reset it.  Therefore the other program has to set the modem
back to data mode when it starts up.  To do this add a modem
reset command (send ATZ expect OK) to the beginning of your slip
or PPP chat script.

.B Accepting both fax and data calls

Many modems have an adaptive data/fax answer mode that can be
enabled using the \fB-j+FAE=1\fP (for Class 1) or \fB-jFAA=1\fP
(for Class 2[.0]) initialization string.  The type of call (data
or fax) can then be deduced from the modem's responses.

Some modems have limited adaptive answer features (e.g. only
working properly at certain baud rates or only in Class 2) or
none at all.  In this case use the initialization string
\fB-i+FCLASS=0\fP to answer in data mode first and the \fB-oa\fP
option to then hang up and try again in fax mode if the first
answer attempt was not successful.  This method only works if
your telephone system waits a few seconds after you hang up
before disconnecting incoming calls.

If the \fB-g\fP option is used then the option's argument will be
run as a shell command when an incoming data call is detected.
Typically this command will exec \fBgetty\fP(8).  This program
should expect to find the modem already off-hook and a lock file
present so it should not try to hang up the line or create a lock
file.  Note that the modem should be set up to report the DCE-DTE
(modem-computer, e.g. CONNECT 38400) speed, not the DCE-DCE
(modem-modem, e.g. CONNECT 14400) speed.  For many modems the
initialization option -iW0 will set this.

The following command will make efax answer incoming calls on
\fB/dev/cua1\fP on the second ring.  This device will be locked
using two different lock files but these lock files will be
removed while waiting for incoming calls (\fB-s\fP).  If a data
call is detected, the \fBgetty\fP program will be run to
initialize the terminal driver and start a \fBlogin\fP(1)
process.  Received fax files will be stored using names like
\fBDec02-12.32.33.001\fP, in the \fB/usr/spool/fax/incoming\fP
directory and the log file will be appended to
\fB/usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1\fP.

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
efax -d /dev/cua1  -j '+FAA=1' \\
   -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1 \\
   -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyS1 \\
   -g "exec /sbin/getty -h /dev/cua1 %d" \\
   -iS0=2 -w -s \\
   -r "/usr/spool/fax/incoming/%b%d-%H.%I.%S" \\
   >> /usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1 2>&1
.ft P
.fi
.LP

Note that adaptive answer of either type will not work for all
callers.  For some data calls the duration of the initial
data-mode answer may be too short for data handshaking to
complete.  In other cases this duration may be so long that
incoming fax calls will time out before efax switches to fax
mode.  In addition, some calling fax modems mistake data-mode
answering tones for fax signaling tones and initiate fax
negotiation too soon.  If you use software adaptive answer you
can reduce the value of the initial data-mode answer (set by
TO_DATAF in efax.c) to get more reliable fax handshaking or
increase it for more reliable data handshaking.  However, if you
need to provide reliable fax and data service to all callers you
should use separate phone numbers for the two types of calls.

When a call is answered the modem goes on-line with the
computer-to-modem baud rate fixed at the speed used for the most
recent AT command.  When efax is waiting for a fax or data call
it sets the interface speed to 19200 bps since this is the speed
required for fax operation.  This prevents full use of 28.8kbps
modem capabilities.


.SH USING LAUNCHD TO RUN EFAX

efax can answer all incoming calls if you create a launchd.plist(5)
file in \fB/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\fP. The launchd(8)
process will run a new copy of efax when the system boots up and
whenever the previous efax process terminates.  The configuration
file should invoke efax by running the \fBfax\fP script with an 
\fBanswer\fP argument.

For example, the following XML Property List keeps efax running 
continuously:

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
	  <key>Label</key>
	  <string>com.cce.efax</string>
	  <key>OnDemand</key>
	  <false/>
	  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
	  <array>
		  <string>/usr/bin/fax</string>
		  <string>answer</string>
	  </array>
  </dict>
  </plist>
.ft P
.fi
.LP

You should protect the fax script and configuration files against
tampering since launchd will execute them as a privileged (root)
process.  If you will be allowing data calls via getty and login
you should ensure that your system is reasonably secure
(e.g. that all user id's have secure passwords).

If efax exec()'s getty properly but you get a garbled login
prompt then there is probably a baud rate mismatch between the
modem and the computer.  First, check the efax log file to make
sure the modem's CONNECT response reported the serial port speed
(e.g. 19200), \fBnot\fP the modem-modem speed (e.g. 14400).
Next, check the getty options and/or configuration files
(e.g. /etc/gettydefs) for that particular baud rate.  Then run
getty manually with the same arguments and verify the port
settings using ``stty </dev/XXX''.  Note that you'll probably
want to enable hardware flow control for data connections (-h for
agetty, CRTSCTS for getty_ps).

A few programs won't work properly when efax is set up to answer
calls because they don't create lock files.  You can put the
shell script ``wrapper'' below around such programs to make them
work properly.  Change BIN and LOCKF to suit.

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
#!/bin/sh
BIN=/bin/badprogram
LOCKF=/var/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1
if [ -f $LOCKF ]
then
        echo lock file $LOCKF exists
        exit 1
else
        printf "%10d\n" $$ >$LOCKF
        $BIN $*
        rm $LOCKF
fi
.ft P
.fi
.LP


.SH DELIVERING RECEIVED FAXES BY E-MAIL

The "fax answer" script described above can be configured to
e-mail the fax files received by the previous fax answer process
to a "fax manager" who can then forward the fax to the correct
recipient.  The received fax files are send as MIME attachments,
one file per page, using the ``base64'' text encoding and the
``image/tiff'' file format.

To view the fax images directly from your e-mail reader you will
have to configure it with an application that can display files
of type image/tiff.  Typically this is specified in a ``mailcap''
file.  For example, placing the following line in /etc/mailcap
will cause the fax file attachments to be displayed using the
``fax view'' command.

.ft CW
image/tiff; fax view %s
.ft P

.SH SENDING FAXES USING THE PRINT SPOOLER

You can configure a "fax" printer into the lpr print spooler that
will fax a document out using efax instead of printing it. To set up a
fax printer do the following:

.ft CW
lpadmin -p fax -E -P /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/PrintCore.framework/Resources/English.lproj/Fax.ppd -v fax://dev/cu.modem
.ft P


You should now be able to send a fax using the lpr interface by
using a command such as:

.IP
.nf
.ft CW
lpr -P fax -ophone="555-1212" file.ps
.ft P
.fi
.LP

You can use lpq(1) to check the fax queue, lprm(1) to remove fax
jobs and lpc(8) to control the spooler.  In each case use the
-Pfax option to specify the fax ``printer.'' A log file will be
mailed to the user when the fax is sent.

See the lpr(1) man page for information on the print spooler.

.SH RESOLVING PROBLEMS

Double check the configuration setup in the first part of the fax
script, particularly the modem device name and the lock file
names.

If efax hangs when trying to open the modem device (typically
/dev/ttyX), the device is either already in use by another
process (e.g. pppd) or it requires the carrier detect line to be
true before it can be opened.  Many systems define an alternate
device name for the same physical device (typically cuaX) that
can be opened even if carrier is not present or other programs
are already using it.

If responses to modem initialization commands are being lost or
generated at random, another processes (e.g. getty or an efax
auto-answer process) may be trying to use the modem at the same
time.  Try running efax while this other program is running.  If
efax does not report "/dev/ttyX locked or busy. waiting."  then
the lock files names are not specified correctly.

Attempt to send a fax. Check that the modem starts making the
calling signal (CNG, a 0.5 second beep every 3 seconds) as soon
as it's finished dialing.  This shows the modem is in fax mode.
You may need to set the SPKR variable to -iM2L3 to monitor the
phone line to do this.

Listen for the answering fax machine and check that it sends the
answer signal (CED, a 3 second beep) followed by "warbling"
sounds (DIS frames) every 3 seconds.  If you hear a continuous
sound (tones or noise) instead, then you've connected to a data
modem instead.

Your modem should send back its own warble (DCS frame) in
response to DIS immediately followed by 1.5 seconds of noise (a
channel check).  If everything is OK, the receiving end will send
another warble (CFR frame) and your modem will start to send
data.  If you have an external modem, check its LEDs.  If flow
control is working properly the modem's send data (SD) LED will
turn off periodically while the fax data is sent.

Check the message showing the line count and the average bit rate
when the page transmission is done.  Low line counts (under 1000
for a letter size image) or the warning "fax output buffer
overflow" while sending indicate that the image data format is
incorrect. Check the file being sent using the "fax view"
command.

If you get the error message ``flow control did not work'' then
flow control was not active.  This usually results in a garbled
transmission and the receiving machine may reject the page, abort
the call, print a distorted or blank image and/or hang up.

The warning "characters received while sending" or an <XOFF>
character appearing after the transmission means that the
operating system ignored the modem's XOFF flow control character.
Ensure that you are not running other programs such as getty or
pppd at the same time as efax since they will turn off xon/xoff
flow control.

If you cannot get flow control to work properly then enable
``virtual flow control'' with the \fB-of\fP option or hardware
flow control with the \fB-oh\fP option.

Check that the remote machine confirms reception with a +FPTS:1
response (Class 2) or an MCF frame (Class 1).

For Class 2 modems, the error message "abnormal call termination
(code \fInn\fP)" indicates that the modem detected an error and
hung up.

Many companies advertise services that will fax back information
on their products.  These can be useful for testing fax
reception.

The message "run length buffer overflow" when receiving indicates
an error with the image data format.  You may need to use the
\fB-or\fP option with certain Class 2 modems.

If efax displays the message "can't happen (<details>)" please
send a bug report to the author.

Finally, don't play "option bingo," if you can't resolve the
problem send a verbose log of the failed session (the output from
\fBfax -v ...\fP) to the address below.

.SH  BUGS

Can't read TIFF files with more than 1 strip

Class 1 operation may fail if the program can't respond to
certain data received from the modem within 55 milliseconds.

May fail if multitasking delays cause the received data to
overflow the computer's serial device buffer or if an under-run
of transmit data exceeds 5 seconds.

Polling does not work.

Does not support 2-D coding, ECM, or BFT.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B efix
[
.I options
]
.I file...

.SH OPTIONS

Where \fIoptions\fP are:

.TP 9
.B -i  \fIf\fP
the input image is in format \fIf\fP. Default is to automatically
determine the input type from its contents.

.TP 9
.B 
   fax
fax ("Group3") 1-D coded image

.TP 9
.B 
   text
text.  Line feeds separate lines, form feeds cause page breaks
and tabs are expanded assuming tabs every 8 columns.

.TP 9
.B 
   pbm
raw PBM (portable bit map)

.TP 9
.B 
   tiffg3
TIFF format with Group 3 (fax) compression.

.TP 9
.B 
   tiffraw
TIFF format with no compression.

.TP 9
.B -o  \fIf\fP
write the output in format \fIf\fP.  Default is tiffg3.

.TP 9
.B 
   fax
fax ("Group3") 1-D coded image

.TP 9
.B 
   pbm
raw PBM

.TP 9
.B 
   pgm
raw PGM (Portable Gray Map).  Gray-scale values are produced by
summing pixels in 4x4 pixel blocks.  The output file is 1/4 of
the size given by -p.  The resulting image has 17 discrete values
between 0 and 255.

.TP 9
.B 
   pcl
HP-PCL (e.g. HP LaserJet).

.TP 9
.B 
   ps
encapsulated Postscript (e.g. Apple Laserwriter).  The file is
compressed using differential coding vertically and run-length
coding horizontally.  There is no provision for positioning the
image within the page and so the image will appear at the lower
left corner of the page when printed.

.TP 9
.B 
   tiffg3
TIFF format with Group 3 (fax) compression.

.TP 9
.B 
   tiffraw
TIFF format with no compression.

.TP 9
.B -n \fIpat\fP
use the printf(3) pattern \fIpath\fP to generate the output file
name.  Up to three %d escapes will be replaced by the page number
starting with 1 (e.g. -n order.%03d will create file names
order.001, order.002, etc.)

.TP 9
.B -v \fIlvl\fP
print messages of type in string \fIlvl\fP.  Each
\fIlower-case\fP letter in \fIlvl\fP enables one type of message:

.RS 12
.B
e - 
errors
.br
.B
w - 
warnings
.br
.B
i - 
information messages
.br
.B
a - 
program arguments
.br
.B
f - 
file format details
.RE

.RS 9
The default is "ewi".
.RE

.TP 9
.B -f \fIfnt\fP
use font file \fIfnt\fP for text.  The font file for an WxH font
should be a bit map of an image of H rows and 256*W columns.
Each successive WxH cell contains the bit map for characters with
codes from 0 to 255.  The default is to use a built-in 8x16 font.

.TP 9
.B -s \fIX\fP\fRx\fP\fIY\fP
scale the input by a factor of X horizontally and Y vertically.
Scaling does not change the size of the output (use -p).  If Y is
not specified it is assumed to be the same as X.  Any floating
point value may be used for X and Y. The default is 1,1.

.TP 9
.B -d \fIR\fP\fR,\fP\fID\fP
displace the output right by R and down by D (opposite if
negative). See below for units.  Default is 0,0.

.TP 9
.B -p \fIW\fP\fRx\fP\fIH\fP
truncate or pad the output to generate an image of width W and
height H.  This does not scale the input.  See below for units.
The default is the size of the input image if it can be
determined or A4 (215x297mm) if it can't.

.TP 9
.B -r \fIX\fP\fRx\fP\fIY\fP
assume an output device resolution of X by Y dots per inch.  If Y
is not specified it is assumed to be the same as X.  The default
is the input resolution if it can be determined or the fax
resolution of 204.1x195.6 dpi if it can't.

.TP 9
.B -R \fIX\fP\fRx\fP\fIY\fP
assume an input device resolution of X by Y dots per inch.  If Y
is not specified it is assumed to be the same as X.  The default
is the input resolution if it can be determined or the fax
resolution of 204.1x195.6 dpi if it can't.

.TP 9
.B -l \fIn\fP
place n lines per page during text input. Default is 66.

.TP 9
.B -O \fIf\fP
overlay (logical OR) the image from file f into the output.  Use
"-" for standard input (-O-).  Default is no overlay file.

.TP 9
.B -M
ignore all other options and copy the standard input to the
standard output while applying base64 (MIME) encoding as
specified by RFC 1521.


.SH FILES

If no -n options are given, output is written to the standard
output.

.SH UNITS

The units of the W, H, R, and D values above are in inches by
default.  Any floating point value may be used.  Units of inches,
centimetres, millimetres or points (72 per inch) can be used
instead by appending one of the strings `in', `cm', `mm', or `pt'
to the argument (e.g. -d2,4cm).

.SH CUT AND PASTE

The -d and -p options allow efix to cut out images from received
faxes for use in other faxes or documents.  The -d option specifies
the top left portion of the desired image and the -p option gives
the size of the cut image.  For example, the command
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
	efix -d-5,-8 -p2,1 sample.001 >sig.001
.ft P
.fi
.RE
would cut out part of the input with its top left corner 5 inches
from the left edge and 8 inches from top of the input image.  The
output image would be 2 inches wide and 1 inch high.

The -O option allows efix to superimpose two or more images.  The
overlay image must be in fax format and cannot be scaled,
truncated or shifted. However, multiple efix commands may be used
to transform images before combining them.  For example, the
commands
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
	efix -d4,8 signature >sig.fax
	efix -O sig.fax letterhead >letterhead.fax
	efix -O letterhead.fax letter.002 >letter.002.new
.ft P
.fi
.RE
will shift the image in the file signature down 8 inches and
right 4 inches and combine (overlay) it with the images in the
files letterhead and letter.002.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm grep
utility searches any given input files,
selecting lines that match one or more patterns.
By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression
(RE) in the pattern matches the input line
without its trailing newline.
An empty expression matches every line.
Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
to the standard output.
.Pp
.Nm grep
is used for simple patterns and
basic regular expressions
.Pq BREs ;
.Nm egrep
can handle extended regular expressions
.Pq EREs .
See
.Xr re_format 7
for more information on regular expressions.
.Nm fgrep
is quicker than both
.Nm grep
and
.Nm egrep ,
but can only handle fixed patterns
(i.e. it does not interpret regular expressions).
Patterns may consist of one or more lines,
allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.
.Pp
.Nm zgrep ,
.Nm zegrep ,
and
.Nm zfgrep
act like
.Nm grep ,
.Nm egrep ,
and
.Nm fgrep ,
respectively, but accept input files compressed with the
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr gzip 1
compression utilities.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar num , Fl Fl after-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of trailing context after each match.
See also the
.Fl B
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl a , Fl Fl text
Treat all files as ASCII text.
Normally
.Nm
will simply print
.Dq Binary file ... matches
if files contain binary characters.
Use of this option forces
.Nm
to output lines matching the specified pattern.
.It Fl B Ar num , Fl Fl before-context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading context before each match.
See also the
.Fl A
and
.Fl C
options.
.It Fl b , Fl Fl byte-offset
The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is
displayed in front of the respective matched line.
.It Fl C Ns Op Ar num , Fl Fl context Ns = Ns Ar num
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match.
The default is 2 and is equivalent to
.Fl A
.Ar 2
.Fl B
.Ar 2 .
Note:
no whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.
.It Fl c , Fl Fl count
Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.
.It Fl Fl colour Ns = Ns Op Ar when , Fl Fl color Ns = Ns Op Ar when
Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in
.Ev GREP_COLOR
environment variable.
The possible values of when can be `never', `always' or `auto'.
.It Fl D Ar action , Fl Fl devices Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.
The default action is `read', which means, that they are read
as if they were normal files.
If the action is set to `skip', devices will be silently skipped.
.It Fl d Ar action , Fl Fl directories Ns = Ns Ar action
Specify the demanded action for directories.
It is `read' by default, which means that the directories
are read in the same manner as normal files.
Other possible values are `skip' to silently ignore the
directories, and `recurse' to read them recursively, which
has the same effect as the
.Fl R
and
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl E , Fl Fl extended-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as an extended regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm egrep ) .
.It Fl e Ar pattern , Fl Fl regexp Ns = Ns Ar pattern
Specify a pattern used during the search of the input:
an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
This option is most useful when multiple
.Fl e
options are used to specify multiple patterns,
or when a pattern begins with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
.It Fl Fl exclude
If specified, it excludes files matching the given
filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include
pattern is specified, all files are searched that are
not excluded.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl exclude-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, it excludes directories matching the
given filename pattern from the search.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns, and if no
.Fl Fl include-dir
pattern is specified, all directories are searched that are
not excluded.
.It Fl F , Fl Fl fixed-strings
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a set of fixed strings
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm fgrep ) .
.It Fl f Ar file , Fl Fl file Ns = Ns Ar file
Read one or more newline separated patterns from
.Ar file .
Empty pattern lines match every input line.
Newlines are not considered part of a pattern.
If
.Ar file
is empty, nothing is matched.
.It Fl G , Fl Fl basic-regexp
Interpret
.Ar pattern
as a basic regular expression
(i.e. force
.Nm grep
to behave as traditional
.Nm grep ) .
.It Fl H
Always print filename headers with output lines.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl no-filename
Never print filename headers
.Pq i.e. filenames
with output lines.
.It Fl Fl help
Print a brief help message.
.It Fl I
Ignore binary files.
This option is equivalent to
.Fl Fl binary-file Ns = Ns Ar without-match
option.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl ignore-case
Perform case insensitive matching.
By default,
.Nm grep
is case sensitive.
.It Fl Fl include
If specified, only files matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include
patterns.
Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
not only to the filename component.
.It Fl Fl include-dir
If
.Fl R
is specified, only directories matching the
given filename pattern are searched.
Note that
.Fl Fl exclude-dir
patterns take priority over
.Fl Fl include-dir
patterns.
.It Fl J, Fl Fl bz2decompress
Decompress the
.Xr bzip2 1
compressed file before looking for the text.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl files-without-match
Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl l , Fl Fl files-with-matches
Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
standard output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
If the standard input is searched, the string
.Dq (standard input)
is written.
.It Fl Fl mmap
Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of
.Xr read 2
to read input, which can result in better performance under some
circumstances but can cause undefined behaviour.
.It Fl m Ar num, Fl Fl max-count Ns = Ns Ar num
Stop reading the file after
.Ar num
matches.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl line-number
Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file,
starting at line 1.
The line number counter is reset for each file processed.
This option is ignored if
.Fl c ,
.Fl L ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl q
is
specified.
.It Fl Fl null
Prints a zero-byte after the file name.
.It Fl O
If
.Fl R
is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explicitly listed
on the command line.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl o, Fl Fl only-matching
Prints only the matching part of the lines.
.It Fl p
If
.Fl R
is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl q , Fl Fl quiet , Fl Fl silent
Quiet mode:
suppress normal output.
.Nm grep
will only search a file until a match has been found,
making searches potentially less expensive.
.It Fl R , Fl r , Fl Fl recursive
Recursively search subdirectories listed.
.It Fl S
If
.Fl R
is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl no-messages
Silent mode.
Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored
(i.e. their error messages are suppressed).
.It Fl U , Fl Fl binary
Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl invert-match
Selected lines are those
.Em not
matching any of the specified patterns.
.It Fl w , Fl Fl word-regexp
The expression is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by
.Sq [[:<:]]
and
.Sq [[:>:]] ;
see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.It Fl x , Fl Fl line-regexp
Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular
expression are considered to be matching lines.
.It Fl y
Equivalent to
.Fl i .
Obsoleted.
.It Fl Z , Fl z , Fl Fl decompress
Force
.Nm grep
to behave as
.Nm zgrep .
.It Fl Fl binary-files Ns = Ns Ar value
Controls searching and printing of binary files.
Options are
.Ar binary ,
the default: search binary files but do not print them;
.Ar without-match :
do not search binary files;
and
.Ar text :
treat all files as text.
.Sm off
.It Fl Fl context Op = Ar num
.Sm on
Print
.Ar num
lines of leading and trailing context.
The default is 2.
.It Fl Fl line-buffered
Force output to be line buffered.
By default, output is line buffered when standard output is a terminal
and block buffered otherwise.
.Pp
.El
If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "GREP_OPTIONS"
.It Ev GREP_OPTIONS
May be used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning
of the argument list.
Backslash-escaping is not supported, unlike the behavior in GNU grep.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm grep
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li 0
One or more lines were selected.
.It Li 1
No lines were selected.
.It Li \*(Gt1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To find all occurrences of the word
.Sq patricia
in a file:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep 'patricia' myfile
.Pp
To find all occurrences of the pattern
.Ql .Pp
at the beginning of a line:
.Pp
.Dl $ grep '^\e.Pp' myfile
.Pp
The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by
.Nm grep
instead of by the user's shell.
The caret
.Ql ^
matches the null string at the beginning of a line,
and the
.Ql \e
escapes the
.Ql \&. ,
which would otherwise match any character.
.Pp
To find all lines in a file which do not contain the words
.Sq foo
or
.Sq bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile
.Pp
A simple example of an extended regular expression:
.Pp
.Dl $ egrep '19|20|25' calendar
.Pp
Peruses the file
.Sq calendar
looking for either 19, 20, or 25.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl AaBbCDdGHhIJLmoPRSUVwZ
are extensions to that specification, and the behaviour of the
.Fl f
flag when used with an empty pattern file is left undefined.
.Pp
All long options are provided for compatibility with
GNU versions of this utility.
.Pp
Historic versions of the
.Nm grep
utility also supported the flags
.Op Fl ruy .
This implementation supports those options;
however, their use is strongly discouraged.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm grep
command first appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not normalize Unicode input, so a pattern containing composed
characters will not match decomposed input, and vice versa.

.I command-line switches

.I files ...
]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GNU Emacs
is a version of
.I Emacs,
written by the author of the original (PDP-10)
.I Emacs,
Richard Stallman.
.br
The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs Manual,
which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone
program.  Please look there for complete and up-to-date documentation.
This man page is updated only when someone volunteers to do so; the
Emacs maintainers' priority goal is to minimize the amount of time
this man page takes away from other more useful projects.
.br
The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses
everything other
.I Emacs
editors do, and it is easily extensible since its
editing commands are written in Lisp.
.PP
.I Emacs
has an extensive interactive help facility,
but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate
.I Emacs
windows and buffers.
CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t)
starts an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals
of
.I Emacs
in a few minutes.
Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you
find a command given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c)
describes a given character's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f)
describes a given Lisp function specified by name.
.PP
.I Emacs's
Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is
easy to recover from editing mistakes.
.PP
.I GNU Emacs's
many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail),
outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells
within
.I Emacs
windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor), and much more.
.PP
There is an extensive reference manual, but
users of other Emacses
should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy.  Users new to
.I Emacs
will be able
to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and
using the self-documentation features.
.PP
.SM Emacs Options
.PP
The following options are of general interest:
.TP 8
.I file
Edit
.I file.
.TP
.BI \+ number
Go to the line specified by
.I number
(do not insert a space between the "+" sign and
the number).  This applies only to the next file specified.
.TP
.BI \+ line:column
Go to the specified
.I line
and
.I column
.TP
.B \-q
Do not load an init file.
.TP
.B \-no-site-file
Do not load the site-wide startup file.
.TP
.BI \-debug-init
Enable
.I Emacs
Lisp debugger during the processing of the user init file
.BI ~/.emacs.
This is useful for debugging problems in the init file.
.TP
.BI \-u " user"
Load
.I user's
init file.
.TP
.BI \-t " file"
Use specified
.I file
as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.
This must be the first argument specified in the command line.
.TP
.B \-version
Display
.I Emacs
version information and exit.
.PP
The following options are lisp-oriented
(these options are processed in the order encountered):
.TP 8
.BI \-f " function"
Execute the lisp function
.I function.
.TP
.BI \-l " file"
Load the lisp code in the file
.I file.
.TP
.BI \-eval " expr"
Evaluate the Lisp expression
.I expr.
.PP
The following options are useful when running
.I Emacs
as a batch editor:
.TP 8
.BI \-batch
Edit in batch mode.  The editor will send messages to stderr.  This
option must be the first in the argument list.  You must use \-l and \-f
options to specify files to execute and functions to call.
.TP
.B \-kill
Exit
.I Emacs
while in batch mode.
.TP
.BI \-L " directory"
Add
.I directory
to the list of directories
.I Emacs
searches for Lisp files.
.\" START DELETING HERE IF YOU'RE NOT USING X
.PP
.SM Using Emacs with X
.PP
.I Emacs
has been tailored to work well with the X window system.
If you run
.I Emacs
from under X windows, it will create its own X window to
display in.  You will probably want to start the editor
as a background process
so that you can continue using your original window.
.PP
.I Emacs
can be started with the following X switches:
.TP 8
.BI \-name " name"
Specifies the name which should be assigned to the initial
.I Emacs
window.  This controls looking up X resources as well as the window title.
.TP 8
.BI \-title " name"
Specifies the title for the initial X window.
.TP 8
.B \-r
Display the
.I Emacs
window in reverse video.
.TP
.BI \-font " font, " \-fn " font"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's font to that specified by
.I font.
You will find the various
.I X
fonts in the
.I /usr/lib/X11/fonts
directory.
Note that
.I Emacs
will only accept fixed width fonts.
Under the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the
value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed
width font.  Furthermore, fonts whose name are of the form
.IR width x height
are generally fixed width, as is the font
.IR fixed .
See
.IR xlsfonts (1)
for more information.

When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between the
switch and the font name.
.TP
.BI \-bw " pixels"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's border width to the number of pixels specified by
.I pixels.
Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.
.TP
.BI \-ib " pixels"
Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified
by
.I pixels.
Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window.
.PP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-geometry " geometry"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's width, height, and position as specified.  The geometry
specification is in the standard X format; see
.IR X (1)
for more information.
The width and height are specified in characters; the default is 80 by
24.  See the Emacs manual, section "Options for Window Size and Position",
for information on how window sizes interact
with selecting or deselecting the tool bar and menu bar.
.PP
.TP 8
.BI \-fg " color"
On color displays, sets the color of the text.

Use the command
.I M-x list-colors-display
for a list of valid
color names.
.TP
.BI \-bg " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's background.
.TP
.BI \-bd " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.
.TP
.BI \-cr " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
.TP
.BI \-ms " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
.TP
.BI \-d " displayname, " \-display " displayname"
Create the
.I Emacs
window on the display specified by
.IR displayname .
Must be the first option specified in the command line.
.TP
.B \-nw
Tells
.I Emacs
not to use its special interface to X.  If you use this
switch when invoking
.I Emacs
from an
.IR xterm (1)
window, display is done in that window.
.PP
You can set
.I X
default values for your
.I Emacs
windows in your
.I \.Xresources
file (see
.IR xrdb (1)).
Use the following format:
.IP
emacs.keyword:value
.PP
where
.I value
specifies the default value of
.I keyword.
.I Emacs
lets you set default values for the following keywords:
.TP 8
.B font (\fPclass\fB Font)
Sets the window's text font.
.TP
.B reverseVideo (\fPclass\fB ReverseVideo)
If
.I reverseVideo's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will be displayed in reverse video.
.TP
.B bitmapIcon (\fPclass\fB BitmapIcon)
If
.I bitmapIcon's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will iconify into the "kitchen sink."
.TP
.B borderWidth (\fPclass\fB BorderWidth)
Sets the window's border width in pixels.
.TP
.B internalBorder (\fPclass\fB BorderWidth)
Sets the window's internal border width in pixels.
.TP
.B foreground (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the window's text color.
.TP
.B background (\fPclass\fB Background)
For color displays,
sets the window's background color.
.TP
.B borderColor (\fPclass\fB BorderColor)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.
.TP
.B cursorColor (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
.TP
.B pointerColor (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
.TP
.B geometry (\fPclass\fB Geometry)
Sets the geometry of the
.I Emacs
window (as described above).
.TP
.B title (\fPclass\fB Title)
Sets the title of the
.I Emacs
window.
.TP
.B iconName (\fPclass\fB Title)
Sets the icon name for the
.I Emacs
window icon.
.PP
If you try to set color values while using a black and white display,
the window's characteristics will default as follows:
the foreground color will be set to black,
the background color will be set to white,
the border color will be set to grey,
and the text and mouse cursors will be set to black.
.PP

.PP
.SH MANUALS
You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs Manual from the Free
Software Foundation, which develops GNU software.  See the file ORDERS
for ordering information.
.br
Your local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available.  As
with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is permitted to
make and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.  The TeX source to the
manual is also included in the Emacs source distribution.
.PP
.SH FILES
/usr/local/share/info - files for the Info documentation browser.
The complete text of the Emacs reference manual is included in a
convenient tree structured form.  Also includes the Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual, useful to anyone wishing to write programs in the
Emacs Lisp extension language.

/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp - Lisp source files and compiled files
that define most editing commands.  Some are preloaded;
others are autoloaded from this directory when used.

/usr/local/libexec/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH - various programs that are
used with GNU Emacs.

/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc - various files of information.

/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* - contains the documentation
strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions
of GNU Emacs.  They are stored here to reduce the size of
Emacs proper.

.br
/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people offering
various services to assist users of GNU Emacs, including education,
troubleshooting, porting and customization.

.PP
.SH BUGS
There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org, for reporting Emacs
bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try
to be sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a
deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs
Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints
on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the version number of
the Emacs you are running in \fIevery\fR bug report that you send in.

Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The purpose of reporting
bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release, if possible.
For personal assistance, look in the SERVICE file (see above) for
a list of people who offer it.

Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.
For more information about Emacs mailing lists, see the
file /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS.  Bugs tend actually to be
fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report
them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
.SH UNRESTRICTIONS
.PP
.I Emacs
is free; anyone may redistribute copies of
.I Emacs
to
anyone under the terms stated in the
.I Emacs
General Public License,
a copy of which accompanies each copy of
.I Emacs
and which also
appears in the reference manual.
.PP
Copies of
.I Emacs
may sometimes be received packaged with distributions of Unix systems,
but it is never included in the scope of any license covering those
systems.  Such inclusion violates the terms on which distribution
is permitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the General Public
License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions
to redistribution of
.I Emacs.
.PP
Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend
.I Emacs,
and urges that
you contribute your extensions to the GNU library.  Eventually GNU
(Gnu's Not Unix) will be a complete replacement for Unix.
Everyone will be free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.

.SH NAME
emacsclient \- tells a running Emacs to visit a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emacsclient
.I "[options] files ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR emacsclient
command.  Full documentation is available in the GNU Info format; see
below.
This manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution, but is not specific to that system.
.PP
.B emacsclient
works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server.
.PP
You can either call
.B emacsclient
directly or let other programs run it for you when necessary.  On
GNU and Unix systems many programs consult the environment
variable EDITOR (sometimes also VISUAL) to obtain the command used for
editing.  Thus, setting this environment variable to 'emacsclient'
will allow these programs to use an already running Emacs for editing.
Other operating systems might have their own methods for defining the
default editor.

For
.B emacsclient
to work, you need an already running Emacs with a server.  Within Emacs,
call the functions `server-start' or `server-mode'.  (Your `.emacs' file
can do this automatically if you add either `(server-start)' or
`(server-mode 1)' to it.)

When you've finished editing the buffer, type `C-x #'
(`server-edit').  This saves the file and sends a message back to the
`emacsclient' program telling it to exit.  The programs that use
`EDITOR' wait for the "editor" (actually, `emacsclient') to exit.  `C-x
#' also checks for other pending external requests to edit various
files, and selects the next such file.

If you set the variable `server-window' to a window or a frame, `C-x
#' displays the server buffer in that window or in that frame.

.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no-wait
returns
immediately without waiting for you to "finish" the buffer in Emacs.
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-eval
do not visit files but instead evaluate the arguments as Emacs
Lisp expressions.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-socket-name=FILENAME
use socket named FILENAME for communication.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-server-file=FILENAME
use TCP configuration file FILENAME for communication.
This can also be specified via the `EMACS_SERVER_FILE' environment variable.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-alternate-editor=EDITOR
if the Emacs server is not running, run the specified editor instead.
This can also be specified via the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR' environment variable.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-display=DISPLAY
tell the server to display the files on the given display.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
print version information and exit
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
print this usage information message and exit
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The program is documented fully in
.IR "Using Emacs as a Server"
available via the Info system.

The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted
using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords
or explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be performed
either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-in filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-in filename"
the input filename, standard input by default.
.IP "\fB\-out filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-out filename"
the output filename, standard output by default.
.IP "\fB\-pass arg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass arg"
the password source. For more information about the format of \fBarg\fR
see the \fB\s-1PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\s0\fR section in \fIopenssl\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-salt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-salt"
use a salt in the key derivation routines. This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-nosalt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nosalt"
don't use a salt in the key derivation routines. This option \fB\s-1SHOULD NOT\s0\fR be
used except for test purposes or compatibility with ancient versions of OpenSSL
and SSLeay.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e"
encrypt the input data: this is the default.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
decrypt the input data.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
base64 process the data. This means that if encryption is taking place
the data is base64 encoded after encryption. If decryption is set then
the input data is base64 decoded before being decrypted.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
if the \fB\-a\fR option is set then base64 process the data on one line.
.IP "\fB\-k password\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k password"
the password to derive the key from. This is for compatibility with previous
versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by the \fB\-pass\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-kfile filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-kfile filename"
read the password to derive the key from the first line of \fBfilename\fR.
This is for compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by
the \fB\-pass\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-S salt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S salt"
the actual salt to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only
of hex digits.
.IP "\fB\-K key\fR" 4
.IX Item "-K key"
the actual key to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only
of hex digits. If only the key is specified, the \s-1IV\s0 must additionally specified
using the \fB\-iv\fR option. When both a key and a password are specified, the
key given with the \fB\-K\fR option will be used and the \s-1IV\s0 generated from the
password will be taken. It probably does not make much sense to specify
both key and password.
.IP "\fB\-iv \s-1IV\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iv IV"
the actual \s-1IV\s0 to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only
of hex digits. When only the key is specified using the \fB\-K\fR option, the
\&\s-1IV\s0 must explicitly be defined. When a password is being specified using
one of the other options, the \s-1IV\s0 is generated from this password.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
print out the key and \s-1IV\s0 used.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P"
print out the key and \s-1IV\s0 used then immediately exit: don't do any encryption
or decryption.
.IP "\fB\-bufsize number\fR" 4
.IX Item "-bufsize number"
set the buffer size for I/O
.IP "\fB\-nopad\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nopad"
disable standard block padding
.IP "\fB\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-debug"
debug the BIOs used for I/O.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
The program can be called either as \fBopenssl ciphername\fR or
\&\fBopenssl enc \-ciphername\fR.
.PP
A password will be prompted for to derive the key and \s-1IV\s0 if necessary.
.PP
The \fB\-salt\fR option should \fB\s-1ALWAYS\s0\fR be used if the key is being derived
from a password unless you want compatibility with previous versions of
OpenSSL and SSLeay.
.PP
Without the \fB\-salt\fR option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary
attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher encrypted data. The reason
for this is that without the salt the same password always generates the same
encryption key. When the salt is being used the first eight bytes of the
encrypted data are reserved for the salt: it is generated at random when
encrypting a file and read from the encrypted file when it is decrypted.
.PP
Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
implications if not used correctly. A beginner is advised to just use
a strong block cipher in \s-1CBC\s0 mode such as bf or des3.
.PP
All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding also known as standard block
padding: this allows a rudimentary integrity or password check to be
performed. However since the chance of random data passing the test is
better than 1 in 256 it isn't a very good test.
.PP
If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the cipher
block length.
.PP
All \s-1RC2\s0 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.
.PP
Blowfish and \s-1RC5\s0 algorithms use a 128 bit key.

.SH "The Unicode Character Map"
.IX Header "The Unicode Character Map"
Encode uses the Unicode Character Map (\s-1UCM\s0) format for source character
mappings.  This format is used by \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1ICU\s0 package and was adopted
by Nick Ing-Simmons for use with the Encode module.  Since \s-1UCM\s0 is
more flexible than Tcl's Encoding Map and far more user-friendly,
this is the recommended format for Encode now.
.PP
A \s-1UCM\s0 file looks like this.
.PP
.Vb 10

.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Anything that follows \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR is treated as a comment.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The header section continues until a line containing the word
\&\s-1CHARMAP.\s0 This section has a form of \fI<keyword> value\fR, one
pair per line.  Strings used as values must be quoted. Barewords are
treated as numbers.  \fI\exXX\fR represents a byte.
.Sp
Most of the keywords are self-explanatory. \fIsubchar\fR means
substitution character, not subcharacter.  When you decode a Unicode
sequence to this encoding but no matching character is found, the byte
sequence defined here will be used.  For most cases, the value here is
\&\ex3F; in \s-1ASCII,\s0 this is a question mark.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1CHARMAP\s0 starts the character map section.  Each line has a form as
follows:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  <UXXXX> \exXX.. |0 # comment
\&    ^     ^      ^
\&    |     |      +\- Fallback flag
\&    |     +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Encoded byte sequence
\&    +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Unicode Character ID in hex
.Ve
.Sp
The format is roughly the same as a header section except for the
fallback flag: | followed by 0..3.   The meaning of the possible
values is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "|0" 4
.IX Item "|0"
Round trip safe.  A character decoded to Unicode encodes back to the
same byte sequence.  Most characters have this flag.
.IP "|1" 4
.IX Item "|1"
Fallback for unicode \-> encoding.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the encode map only.
.IP "|2" 4
.IX Item "|2"
Skip sub-char mapping should there be no code point.
.IP "|3" 4
.IX Item "|3"
Fallback for encoding \-> unicode.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the decode map only.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
And finally, \s-1END OF CHARMAP\s0 ends the section.
.PP
When you are manually creating a \s-1UCM\s0 file, you should copy ascii.ucm
or an existing encoding which is close to yours, rather than write
your own from scratch.
.PP
When you do so, make sure you leave at least \fBU0000\fR to \fBU0020\fR as
is, unless your environment is \s-1EBCDIC.\s0
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: not all features in \s-1UCM\s0 are implemented.  For example,
icu:state is not used.  Because of that, you need to write a perl
module if you want to support algorithmical encodings, notably
the \s-1ISO\-2022\s0 series.  Such modules include Encode::JP::2022_JP,
Encode::KR::2022_KR, and Encode::TW::HZ.
.SS "Coping with duplicate mappings"
.IX Subsection "Coping with duplicate mappings"
When you create a map, you \s-1SHOULD\s0 make your mappings round-trip safe.
That is, \f(CW\*(C`encode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, decode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, $data)) eq
$data\*(C'\fR stands for all characters that are marked as \f(CW\*(C`|0\*(C'\fR.  Here is
how to make sure:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Sort your map in Unicode order.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When you have a duplicate entry, mark either one with '|1' or '|3'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
And make sure the '|1' or '|3' entry \s-1FOLLOWS\s0 the '|0' entry.
.PP
Here is an example from big5\-eten.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  <U2550> \exF9\exF9 |0
\&  <U2550> \exA2\exA4 |3
.Ve
.PP
Internally Encoding \-> Unicode and Unicode \-> Encoding Map looks like
this;
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exF9\exF9 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550
.Ve
.PP
So it is round-trip safe for \exF9\exF9.  But if the line above is upside
down, here is what happens.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  (\exF9\exF9 => U2550 is now overwritten!)
.Ve
.PP
The Encode package comes with \fIucmlint\fR, a crude but sufficient
utility to check the integrity of a \s-1UCM\s0 file.  Check under the
Encode/bin directory for this.
.PP
When in doubt, you can use \fIucmsort\fR, yet another utility under
Encode/bin directory.

\&\fIenc2xs\fR builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either
Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).
Besides being used internally during the build process of the Encode
module, you can use \fIenc2xs\fR to add your own encoding to perl.
No knowledge of \s-1XS\s0 is necessary.
.SH "Quick Guide"
.IX Header "Quick Guide"
If you want to know as little about Perl as possible but need to
add a new encoding, just read this chapter and forget the rest.
.IP "0." 4
.IX Item "0."
Have a .ucm file ready.  You can get it from somewhere or you can write
your own from scratch or you can grab one from the Encode distribution
and customize it.  For the \s-1UCM\s0 format, see the next Chapter.  In the
example below, I'll call my theoretical encoding myascii, defined
in \fImy.ucm\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR is a shell prompt.

Now take a look at your current directory.  It should look like this.

to update Encode::ConfigLocal, a module that controls local settings.
After that, \*(L"use Encode;\*(R" is enough to load your encodings on demand.
.SH "The Unicode Character Map"
.IX Header "The Unicode Character Map"
Encode uses the Unicode Character Map (\s-1UCM\s0) format for source character
mappings.  This format is used by \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1ICU\s0 package and was adopted
by Nick Ing-Simmons for use with the Encode module.  Since \s-1UCM\s0 is
more flexible than Tcl's Encoding Map and far more user-friendly,
this is the recommended format for Encode now.
.PP
A \s-1UCM\s0 file looks like this.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  #

\&  END CHARMAP
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Anything that follows \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR is treated as a comment.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The header section continues until a line containing the word
\&\s-1CHARMAP\s0. This section has a form of \fI<keyword> value\fR, one
pair per line.  Strings used as values must be quoted. Barewords are
treated as numbers.  \fI\exXX\fR represents a byte.
.Sp
Most of the keywords are self-explanatory. \fIsubchar\fR means
substitution character, not subcharacter.  When you decode a Unicode
sequence to this encoding but no matching character is found, the byte
sequence defined here will be used.  For most cases, the value here is
\&\ex3F; in \s-1ASCII\s0, this is a question mark.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1CHARMAP\s0 starts the character map section.  Each line has a form as
follows:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  <UXXXX> \exXX.. |0 # comment
\&    ^     ^      ^
\&    |     |      +\- Fallback flag
\&    |     +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Encoded byte sequence
\&    +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Unicode Character ID in hex
.Ve
.Sp
The format is roughly the same as a header section except for the
fallback flag: | followed by 0..3.   The meaning of the possible
values is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "|0" 4
.IX Item "|0"
Round trip safe.  A character decoded to Unicode encodes back to the
same byte sequence.  Most characters have this flag.
.IP "|1" 4
.IX Item "|1"
Fallback for unicode \-> encoding.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the encode map only.
.IP "|2" 4
.IX Item "|2"
Skip sub-char mapping should there be no code point.
.IP "|3" 4
.IX Item "|3"
Fallback for encoding \-> unicode.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the decode map only.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
And finally, \s-1END\s0 \s-1OF\s0 \s-1CHARMAP\s0 ends the section.
.PP
When you are manually creating a \s-1UCM\s0 file, you should copy ascii.ucm
or an existing encoding which is close to yours, rather than write
your own from scratch.
.PP
When you do so, make sure you leave at least \fBU0000\fR to \fBU0020\fR as
is, unless your environment is \s-1EBCDIC\s0.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: not all features in \s-1UCM\s0 are implemented.  For example,
icu:state is not used.  Because of that, you need to write a perl
module if you want to support algorithmical encodings, notably
the \s-1ISO\-2022\s0 series.  Such modules include Encode::JP::2022_JP,
Encode::KR::2022_KR, and Encode::TW::HZ.
.SS "Coping with duplicate mappings"
.IX Subsection "Coping with duplicate mappings"
When you create a map, you \s-1SHOULD\s0 make your mappings round-trip safe.
That is, \f(CW\*(C`encode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, decode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, $data)) eq
$data\*(C'\fR stands for all characters that are marked as \f(CW\*(C`|0\*(C'\fR.  Here is
how to make sure:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Sort your map in Unicode order.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When you have a duplicate entry, mark either one with '|1' or '|3'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
And make sure the '|1' or '|3' entry \s-1FOLLOWS\s0 the '|0' entry.
.PP
Here is an example from big5\-eten.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  <U2550> \exF9\exF9 |0
\&  <U2550> \exA2\exA4 |3
.Ve
.PP
Internally Encoding \-> Unicode and Unicode \-> Encoding Map looks like
this;
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exF9\exF9 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550
.Ve
.PP
So it is round-trip safe for \exF9\exF9.  But if the line above is upside
down, here is what happens.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  (\exF9\exF9 => U2550 is now overwritten!)
.Ve
.PP
The Encode package comes with \fIucmlint\fR, a crude but sufficient
utility to check the integrity of a \s-1UCM\s0 file.  Check under the
Encode/bin directory for this.
.PP
When in doubt, you can use \fIucmsort\fR, yet another utility under
Encode/bin directory.

\&\fIenc2xs\fR builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either
Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).
Besides being used internally during the build process of the Encode
module, you can use \fIenc2xs\fR to add your own encoding to perl.
No knowledge of \s-1XS\s0 is necessary.

If you want to know as little about Perl as possible but need to
add a new encoding, just read this chapter and forget the rest.

Have a .ucm file ready.  You can get it from somewhere or you can write
your own from scratch or you can grab one from the Encode distribution
and customize it.  For the \s-1UCM\s0 format, see the next Chapter.  In the
example below, I'll call my theoretical encoding myascii, defined
in \fImy.ucm\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR is a shell prompt.

.SH "The Unicode Character Map"
.IX Header "The Unicode Character Map"
Encode uses the Unicode Character Map (\s-1UCM\s0) format for source character
mappings.  This format is used by \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1ICU\s0 package and was adopted
by Nick Ing-Simmons for use with the Encode module.  Since \s-1UCM\s0 is
more flexible than Tcl's Encoding Map and far more user-friendly,
this is the recommended format for Encode now.
.PP
A \s-1UCM\s0 file looks like this.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  #

\&  END CHARMAP
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Anything that follows \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR is treated as a comment.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The header section continues until a line containing the word
\&\s-1CHARMAP.\s0 This section has a form of \fI<keyword> value\fR, one
pair per line.  Strings used as values must be quoted. Barewords are
treated as numbers.  \fI\exXX\fR represents a byte.
.Sp
Most of the keywords are self-explanatory. \fIsubchar\fR means
substitution character, not subcharacter.  When you decode a Unicode
sequence to this encoding but no matching character is found, the byte
sequence defined here will be used.  For most cases, the value here is
\&\ex3F; in \s-1ASCII,\s0 this is a question mark.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1CHARMAP\s0 starts the character map section.  Each line has a form as
follows:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  <UXXXX> \exXX.. |0 # comment
\&    ^     ^      ^
\&    |     |      +\- Fallback flag
\&    |     +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Encoded byte sequence
\&    +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Unicode Character ID in hex
.Ve
.Sp
The format is roughly the same as a header section except for the
fallback flag: | followed by 0..3.   The meaning of the possible
values is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "|0" 4
.IX Item "|0"
Round trip safe.  A character decoded to Unicode encodes back to the
same byte sequence.  Most characters have this flag.
.IP "|1" 4
.IX Item "|1"
Fallback for unicode \-> encoding.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the encode map only.
.IP "|2" 4
.IX Item "|2"
Skip sub-char mapping should there be no code point.
.IP "|3" 4
.IX Item "|3"
Fallback for encoding \-> unicode.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
character for the decode map only.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
And finally, \s-1END OF CHARMAP\s0 ends the section.
.PP
When you are manually creating a \s-1UCM\s0 file, you should copy ascii.ucm
or an existing encoding which is close to yours, rather than write
your own from scratch.
.PP
When you do so, make sure you leave at least \fBU0000\fR to \fBU0020\fR as
is, unless your environment is \s-1EBCDIC.\s0
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: not all features in \s-1UCM\s0 are implemented.  For example,
icu:state is not used.  Because of that, you need to write a perl
module if you want to support algorithmical encodings, notably
the \s-1ISO\-2022\s0 series.  Such modules include Encode::JP::2022_JP,
Encode::KR::2022_KR, and Encode::TW::HZ.
.SS "Coping with duplicate mappings"
.IX Subsection "Coping with duplicate mappings"
When you create a map, you \s-1SHOULD\s0 make your mappings round-trip safe.
That is, \f(CW\*(C`encode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, decode(\*(Aqyour\-encoding\*(Aq, $data)) eq
$data\*(C'\fR stands for all characters that are marked as \f(CW\*(C`|0\*(C'\fR.  Here is
how to make sure:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Sort your map in Unicode order.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When you have a duplicate entry, mark either one with '|1' or '|3'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
And make sure the '|1' or '|3' entry \s-1FOLLOWS\s0 the '|0' entry.
.PP
Here is an example from big5\-eten.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  <U2550> \exF9\exF9 |0
\&  <U2550> \exA2\exA4 |3
.Ve
.PP
Internally Encoding \-> Unicode and Unicode \-> Encoding Map looks like
this;
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exF9\exF9 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550
.Ve
.PP
So it is round-trip safe for \exF9\exF9.  But if the line above is upside
down, here is what happens.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  E to U               U to E
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  \exA2\exA4 => U2550    U2550 => \exF9\exF9
\&  (\exF9\exF9 => U2550 is now overwritten!)
.Ve
.PP
The Encode package comes with \fIucmlint\fR, a crude but sufficient
utility to check the integrity of a \s-1UCM\s0 file.  Check under the
Encode/bin directory for this.
.PP
When in doubt, you can use \fIucmsort\fR, yet another utility under
Encode/bin directory.

.SH NAME
encode_keychange - produce the KeyChange string for SNMPv3
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B encode_keychange 
-t md5|sha1
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B encode_keychange
produces a KeyChange string using the old and new passphrases 
as described in Section 5 of RFC 2274 "User-based Security Model (USM) for 
version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)". \fB-t\fR
option is mandatory and specifies the hash transform type to use.

The transform is used to convert passphrase to master key for a given
user (Ku), convert master key to the localized key (Kul), and to hash the 
old Kul with the random bits. 

Passphrases are obtained by examining a number of sources until success
(in order listed):
.IP
command line options (see 
.B -N
and
.B -O
options below);
.IP
the file 
.B $HOME/.snmp/passphrase.ek
which should only contain two lines with old and new passphrase;
.IP
standard input \fB\-or\-\fR  user input from the terminal.
.PP

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-E\fR [0x]<\fIengineID\fR> EngineID used for Kul generation.
<\fIengineID\fR> is intepreted as a hex string when preceeded by 0x,
otherwise it is treated as a text string. If no <\fIengineID\fR> is
specified, it is constructed from the first IP address for the local
host.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Force passphrases to be read from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Display the help message.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR "<\fInew_passphrase\fR>"

.Sh NAME
.Nm env
.Nd set environment and execute command, or print environment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl iv
.Op Fl P Ar altpath
.Op Fl S Ar string
.Op Fl u Ar name
.Op Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Op Ar utility Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes another
.Ar utility
after modifying the environment as
specified on the command line.
Each
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
option specifies the setting of an environment variable,
.Ar name ,
with a value of
.Ar value .
All such environment variables are set before the
.Ar utility
is executed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i
Execute the
.Ar utility
with only those environment variables specified by
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
options.
The environment inherited
by
.Nm
is ignored completely.
.\"	-P
.It Fl P Ar altpath
Search the set of directories as specified by
.Ar altpath
to locate the specified
.Ar utility
program, instead of using the value of the
.Ev PATH
environment variable.
.\"	-S
.It Fl S Ar string
Split apart the given
.Ar string
into multiple strings, and process each of the resulting strings
as separate arguments to the
.Nm
utility.
The
.Fl S
option recognizes some special character escape sequences and
also supports environment-variable substitution, as described
below.
.\"	-u
.It Fl u Ar name
If the environment variable
.Ar name
is in the environment, then remove it before processing the
remaining options.
This is similar to the
.Ic unset
command in
.Xr sh 1 .
The value for
.Ar name
must not include the
.Ql =
character.
.\"	-v
.It Fl v
Print verbose information for each step of processing done by the
.Nm
utility.
Additional information will be printed if
.Fl v
is specified multiple times.
.El
.Pp
The above options are only recognized when they are specified
before any
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
options.
.Pp
If no
.Ar utility
is specified,
.Nm
prints out the names and values
of the variables in the environment, with one name/value pair per line.
.\"
.Ss Details of Fl S Ss (split-string) processing
The processing of the
.Fl S
option will split the given
.Ar string
into separate arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the
.Ar string .
Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been
specified as a separate argument on the original
.Nm
command.
.Pp
Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using
single
.Pq Dq Li '
or double
.Pq Ql \&"
quotes, or backslashes
.Pq Ql \e .
Single quotes will escape all non-single quote characters, up to
the matching single quote.
Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters, up to
the matching double quote.
It is an error if the end of the
.Ar string
is reached before the matching quote character.
.Pp
If
.Fl S
would create a new argument that starts with the
.Ql #
character, then that argument and the remainder of the
.Ar string
will be ignored.
The
.Ql \e#
sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start
with a
.Ql #
character, without causing the remainder of the
.Ar string
to be skipped.
.Pp
While processing the
.Ar string
value,
.Fl S
processing will treat certain character combinations as escape
sequences which represent some action to take.
The character escape sequences are in backslash notation.
The characters and their meanings are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent -compact
.It Cm \ec
Ignore the remaining characters in the
.Ar string .
This must not appear inside a double-quoted string.
.It Cm \ef
Replace with a <form-feed> character.
.It Cm \en
Replace with a <new-line> character.
.It Cm \er
Replace with a <carriage return> character.
.It Cm \et
Replace with a <tab> character.
.It Cm \ev
Replace with a <vertical tab> character.
.It Cm \e#
Replace with a
.Ql #
character.
This would be useful when you need a
.Ql #
as the first character in one of the arguments created
by splitting apart the given
.Ar string .
.It Cm \e$
Replace with a
.Ql $
character.
.It Cm \e_
If this is found inside of a double-quoted string, then replace it
with a single blank.
If this is found outside of a quoted string, then treat this as the
separator character between new arguments in the original
.Ar string .
.It Cm \e"
Replace with a <double quote> character.
.It Cm \e\'
Replace with a <single quote> character.
.It Cm \e\e
Replace with a backslash character.
.El
.Pp
The sequences for <single-quote> and backslash are the only sequences
which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string.
The other sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted
string.
All escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string.
It is an error if a single
.Ql \e
character is followed by a character other than the ones listed above.
.Pp
The processing of
.Fl S
also supports substitution of values from environment variables.
To do this, the name of the environment variable must be inside of
.Ql ${} ,
such as:
.Li ${SOMEVAR} .
The common shell syntax of
.Li $SOMEVAR
is not supported.
All values substituted will be the values of the environment variables
as they were when the
.Nm
utility was originally invoked.
Those values will not be checked for any of the escape sequences as
described above.
And any settings of
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
will not effect the values used for substitution in
.Fl S
processing.
.Pp
Also,
.Fl S
processing can not reference the value of the special parameters
which are defined by most shells.
For instance,
.Fl S
can not recognize special parameters such as:
.Ql $* ,
.Ql $@ ,
.Ql $# ,
.Ql $?
or
.Ql $$
if they appear inside the given
.Ar string .
.\"
.Ss Use in shell-scripts
The
.Nm
utility is often used as the
.Ar interpreter
on the first line of interpreted scripts, as
described in
.Xr execve 2 .
.Pp
Note that the way the kernel parses the
.Ql #!
(first line) of an interpreted script has changed as of
.Fx 6.0 .
Prior to that, the
.Fx
kernel would split that first line into separate arguments based
on any whitespace (space or <tab> characters) found in the line.
So, if a script named
.Pa /usr/local/bin/someport
had a first line of:
.Pp
.Dl "#!/usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0"
.Pp
then the
.Pa /usr/local/bin/php
program would have been started with the arguments of:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
arg[1] = '-n'
arg[2] = '-q'
arg[3] = '-dsafe_mode=0'
arg[4] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'
.Ed
.Pp
plus any arguments the user specified when executing
.Pa someport .
However, this processing of multiple options on the
.Ql #!
line is not the way any other operating system parses the
first line of an interpreted script.
So after a change which was made for
.Fx 6.0
release, that script will result in
.Pa /usr/local/bin/php
being started with the arguments of:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
arg[1] = '-n -q -dsafe_mode=0'
arg[2] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'
.Ed
.Pp
plus any arguments the user specified.
This caused a significant change in the behavior of a few scripts.
In the case of above script, to have it behave the same way under
.Fx 6.0
as it did under earlier releases, the first line should be
changed to:
.Pp
.Dl "#!/usr/bin/env -S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0"
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will be started with the entire line as a single
argument:
.Pp
.Dl "arg[1] = '-S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0'"
.Pp
and then
.Fl S
processing will split that line into separate arguments before
executing
.Pa /usr/local/bin/php .
.\"
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
utility uses the
.Ev PATH
environment variable to locate the requested
.Ar utility
if the name contains no
.Ql /
characters, unless the
.Fl P
option has been specified.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
An exit status of 126 indicates that
.Ar utility
was found, but could not be executed.
An exit status of 127 indicates that
.Ar utility
could not be found.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Since the
.Nm
utility is often used as part of the first line of an interpreted script,
the following examples show a number of ways that the
.Nm
utility can be useful in scripts.
.Pp
The kernel processing of an interpreted script does not allow a script
to directly reference some other script as its own interpreter.
As a way around this, the main difference between
.Pp
.Dl #!/usr/local/bin/foo
and
.Dl "#!/usr/bin/env /usr/local/bin/foo"
.Pp
is that the latter works even if
.Pa /usr/local/bin/foo
is itself an interpreted script.
.Pp
Probably the most common use of
.Nm
is to find the correct interpreter for a script, when the interpreter
may be in different directories on different systems.
The following example will find the
.Ql perl
interpreter by searching through the directories specified by
.Ev PATH .
.Pp
.Dl "#!/usr/bin/env perl"
.Pp
One limitation of that example is that it assumes the user's value
for
.Ev PATH
is set to a value which will find the interpreter you want
to execute.
The
.Fl P
option can be used to make sure a specific list of directories is
used in the search for
.Ar utility .
Note that the
.Fl S
option is also required for this example to work correctly.
.Pp
.Dl "#!/usr/bin/env -S -P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin perl"
.Pp
The above finds
.Ql perl
only if it is in
.Pa /usr/local/bin
or
.Pa /usr/bin .
That could be combined with the present value of
.Ev PATH ,
to provide more flexibility.
Note that spaces are not required between the
.Fl S
and
.Fl P
options:
.Pp
.Dl "#!/usr/bin/env -S-P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:${PATH} perl"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
utility accepts the
.Fl
option as a synonym for
.Fl i .

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
The
.Fl P , S , u
and
.Fl v
options are non-standard extensions supported by
.Fx ,
but which may not be available on other operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
The
.Fl P , S
and
.Fl v
options were added in
.Fx 6.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not handle values of
.Ar utility
which have an equals sign
.Pq Ql =
in their name, for obvious reasons.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not take multibyte characters into account when
processing the

.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the GNU version of
.BR eqn ,
which is part of the groff document formatting system.
.B eqn
compiles descriptions of equations embedded within
.B troff
input files into commands that are understood by
.BR troff .
Normally, it should be invoked using the
.B \-e
option of
.BR groff .
The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.
The output of GNU
.B eqn
cannot be processed with Unix troff;
it must be processed with GNU troff.
If no files are given on the command line, the standard input
will be read.
A filename of
.B \-
will cause the standard input to be read.
.
.LP
.B eqn
searches for the file
.B eqnrc
in the directories given with the
.B \-M
option first, then in
.BR /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac ,
.BR /usr/share/groff/site-tmac ,
and finally in the standard macro directory
.BR /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac .
If it exists,
.B eqn
will process it before the other input files.
The
.B \-R
option prevents this.
.
.LP
GNU
.B eqn
does not provide the functionality of neqn:
it does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
(although it may work adequately for very simple input).
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d xy
Specify delimiters
.I x
and\~\c
.I y
for the left and right end, respectively, of in-line equations.
Any
.B delim
statements in the source file overrides this.
.
.TP
.B \-C
Recognize
.B .EQ
and
.B .EN
even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
.TP
.B \-N
Don't allow newlines within delimiters.
This option allows
.B eqn
to recover better from missing closing delimiters.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.TP
.B \-r
Only one size reduction.
.
.TP
.BI \-m n
The minimum point-size is\~\c
.IR n .
.B eqn
will not reduce the size of subscripts or superscripts to
a smaller size than\~\c
.IR n .
.
.TP
.BI \-T name
The output is for device
.IR name .
The only effect of this is to define a macro
.I name
with a value of\~\c
.BR 1 .
Typically
.B eqnrc
will use this to provide definitions appropriate for the output device.
The default output device is
.BR ps .
.
.TP
.BI \-M dir
Search
.I dir
for
.B eqnrc
before the default directories.
.
.TP
.B \-R
Don't load
.BR eqnrc .
.
.TP
.BI \-f F
This is equivalent to a
.BI gfont\  F
command.
.
.TP
.BI \-s n
This is equivalent to a
.BI gsize\  n
command.
This option is deprecated.
.B eqn
will normally set equations at whatever the current point size
is when the equation is encountered.
.
.TP
.BI \-p n
This says that subscripts and superscripts should be
.I n\~\c
points smaller than the surrounding text.
This option is deprecated. 
Normally
.B eqn
makes sets subscripts and superscripts at 70% 
of the size of the surrounding text.
.
.
.SH USAGE
Only the differences between GNU
.B eqn
and Unix eqn are described here.
.
.LP
Most of the new features of GNU
.B eqn
are based on \*(tx.
There are some references to the differences between \*(tx and GNU
.B eqn
below;
these may safely be ignored if you do not know \*(tx.
.
.SS Automatic spacing
.B eqn
gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the spacing
between components using that type.
Possible types are:
.
.RS
.TP \w'punctuation'u+2n
ordinary
an ordinary character such as `1' or `\c
.IR x ';
.
.TP
operator
a large operator such as
.ds Su `\s+5\(*S\s0'
.if \n(.g .if !c\(*S .ds Su the summation operator
\*(Su;
.
.TP
binary
a binary operator such as `\(pl';
.
.TP
relation
a relation such as `=';
.
.TP
opening
a opening bracket such as `(';
.
.TP
closing
a closing bracket such as `)';
.
.TP
punctuation
a punctuation character such as `,';
.
.TP
inner
a subformula contained within brackets;
.TP
suppress
spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.
.RE
.
.LP
Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.
.
.TP
.BI type\  t\ e
This yields an equation component that contains\~\c
.I e
but that has type\~\c
.IR t ,
where
.I t
is one of the types mentioned above.
For example,
.B times
is defined as
.
.RS
.IP
.B
type "binary" \e(mu
.RE
.
.IP
The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but quoting protects
from macro expansion.
.
.TP
.BI chartype\  t\ text
Unquoted groups of characters are split up into individual characters,
and the type of each character is looked up;
this changes the type that is stored for each character;
it says that the characters in
.I text
from now on have type\~\c
.IR t .
For example,
.
.RS
.IP
.B
chartype "punctuation" .,;:
.RE
.
.IP
would make the characters `.,;:' have type punctuation
whenever they subsequently appeared in an equation.
The type\~\c
.I t
can also be
.B letter
or
.BR digit ;
in these cases
.B chartype
changes the font type of the characters.
See the
.B Fonts
subsection.
.
.SS New primitives
.TP
.IB e1\  smallover\  e2
This is similar to
.BR over ;
.B smallover
reduces the size of
.I e1
and
.IR e2 ;
it also puts less vertical space between
.I e1
or
.I e2
and the fraction bar.
The
.B over
primitive corresponds to the \*(tx
.B \eover
primitive in display styles;
.B smallover
corresponds to
.B \eover
in non-display styles.
.
.TP
.BI vcenter\  e
This vertically centers
.I e
about the math axis.
The math axis is the vertical position about which characters
such as `\(pl' and `\(mi' are centered; also it is the vertical position
used for the bar of fractions.
For example,
.B sum
is defined as
.
.RS
.IP
.B
{ type "operator" vcenter size +5 \e(*S }
.RE
.
.TP
.IB e1\  accent\  e2
This sets
.I e2
as an accent over
.IR e1 .
.I e2
is assumed to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
.I e2
will be moved down according if
.I e1
is taller or shorter than a lowercase letter.
For example,
.B hat
is defined as
.
.RS
.IP
.B
accent { "^" }
.RE
.
.IP
.BR dotdot ,
.BR dot ,
.BR tilde ,
.BR vec ,
and
.B dyad
are also defined using the
.B accent
primitive.
.
.TP
.IB e1\  uaccent\  e2
This sets
.I e2
as an accent under
.IR e1 .
.I e2
is assumed to be at the correct height for a character without a descender;
.I e2
will be moved down if
.I e1
has a descender.
.B utilde
is pre-defined using
.B uaccent
as a tilde accent below the baseline.
.
.TP
.BI split\ \(ts text \(ts
This has the same effect as simply
.
.RS
.IP
.I text
.RE
.
.IP
but
.I text
is not subject to macro expansion because it is quoted;
.I text
will be split up and the spacing between individual characters
will be adjusted.
.
.TP
.BI nosplit\  text
This has the same effect as
.
.RS
.IP
.BI \(ts text \(ts
.RE
.
.IP
but because
.I text
is not quoted it will be subject to macro expansion;
.I text
will not be split up
and the spacing between individual characters will not be adjusted.
.
.TP
.IB e\  opprime
This is a variant of
.B prime
that acts as an operator on\~\c
.IR e .
It produces a different result from
.B prime
in a case such as
.BR A\ opprime\ sub\ 1 :
with
.B opprime
the\~\c
.B 1
will be tucked under the prime as a subscript to the\~\c
.B A
(as is conventional in mathematical typesetting),
whereas with
.B prime
the\~\c
.B 1
will be a subscript to the prime character.
The precedence of
.B opprime
is the same as that of
.B bar
and
.BR under ,
which is higher than that of everything except
.B accent
and
.BR uaccent .
In unquoted text a\~\c
.B '
that is not the first character will be treated like
.BR opprime .
.
.TP
.BI special\  text\ e
This constructs a new object from\~\c
.I e
using a
.BR troff (1)
macro named
.IR text .
When the macro is called,
the string
.B 0s
will contain the output for\~\c
.IR e ,
and the number registers
.BR 0w ,
.BR 0h ,
.BR 0d ,
.BR 0skern ,
and
.BR 0skew
will contain the width, height, depth, subscript kern, and skew of\~\c
.IR e .
(The
.I "subscript kern"
of an object says how much a subscript on that object should be tucked in;
the
.I skew
of an object says how far to the right of the center of the object an
accent over the object should be placed.)
The macro must modify
.B 0s
so that it will output the desired result with its origin at the current
point, and increase the current horizontal position by the width
of the object.
The number registers must also be modified so that they correspond to the
result.

.BI space\  n
A positive value of the integer\~\c
.I n
(in hundredths of an em) sets the vertical spacing before the equation,
a negative value sets the spacing after the equation, replacing the
default values.
This primitive provides an interface to
.BR groff 's
.B \ex
escape (but with opposite sign).
.
.IP
This keyword has no effect if the equation is part of a
.B pic
picture.

(in hundredths of an em) increases the vertical spacing between rows,
using
.BR groff 's
.B \ex
escape.
Negative values are possible but have no effect.
If there is more than a single value given in a matrix, the biggest one
is used.
.
.SS Customization
The appearance of equations is controlled by a large number of parameters.
These can be set using
the

command.

is an integer.
For example,

.B minimum_size
.B eqn
will not set anything at a smaller point-size than this.
The value is in points.
.
.TP
.B fat_offset
The
.B fat
primitive emboldens an equation
by overprinting two copies of the equation
horizontally offset by this amount.
.
.TP
.B over_hang
A fraction bar will be longer by twice this amount than
the maximum of the widths of the numerator and denominator;
in other words, it will overhang the numerator and
denominator by at least this amount.
.
.TP
.B accent_width
When
.B bar
or
.B under
is applied to a single character,
the line will be this long.
Normally,
.B bar
or
.B under
produces a line whose length is the width of the object to which it applies;
in the case of a single character,
this tends to produce a line that looks too long.
.
.TP
.B delimiter_factor
Extensible delimiters produced with the
.B left
and
.B right
primitives will have a combined height and depth of at least this many
thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which the sub-equation that
the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.
.
.TP
.B delimiter_shortfall
Extensible delimiters produced with the
.B left
and
.B right
primitives will have a combined height and depth
not less than the difference of
twice the maximum amount by which the sub-equation that
the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis
and this amount.
.
.TP
.B null_delimiter_space
This much horizontal space is inserted
on each side of a fraction.
.
.TP
.B script_space
The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by this amount.
.
.TP
.B thin_space
This amount of space is automatically inserted after punctuation
characters.

This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side
of binary operators.
.
.TP
.B thick_space
This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of
relations.
.
.TP
.B x_height
The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as `x'.
.
.TP
.B axis_height
The height above the baseline of the center of characters
such as `\(pl' and `\(mi'.
It is important that this value is correct for the font
you are using.
.
.TP
.B default_rule_thickness
This should set to the thickness of the
.B \e(ru
character, or the thickness of horizontal lines produced with the
.B \eD
escape sequence.
.
.TP
.B num1
The
.B over
command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.
.
.TP
.B num2

fractions
will be shifted up by at least this amount.
This is usually less than sup1.

or subscripts or lower limits will be shifted up by at least
this amount.
This is usually less than sup2.
.
.TP
.B sub1
Subscripts will normally be shifted down by at least this amount.
.
.TP
.B sub2
When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the subscript
will be shifted down by at least this amount.
.
.TP
.B sup_drop
The baseline of a superscript will be no more
than this much amount below the top of the object on
which the superscript is set.
.
.TP
.B sub_drop
The baseline of a subscript will be at least this much below
the bottom of the object on which the subscript is set.
.
.TP
.B big_op_spacing1
The baseline of an upper limit will be at least this
much above the top of the object on which the limit is set.

.
.TP
.B big_op_spacing5
This much vertical space will be added above and below limits.
.
.TP
.B baseline_sep

this far apart.
In most cases this should be equal to the sum of
.B num1
and
.BR denom1 .
.
.TP
.B shift_down
The midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom baseline
in a matrix or pile will be shifted down by this much from the axis.
In most cases this should be equal to
.BR axis_height .
.
.TP
.B column_sep
This much space will be added between columns in a matrix.
.
.TP
.B matrix_side_sep
This much space will be added at each side of a matrix.
.
.TP
.B draw_lines
If this is non-zero, lines will be drawn using the
.B \eD
escape sequence, rather than with the
.B \el
escape sequence and the
.B \e(ru
character.
.
.TP
.B body_height
The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this
will be added as extra space before the line containing the equation
(using
.BR \ex ).
The default value is 85.
.
.TP
.B body_depth
The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds this
will be added as extra space after the line containing the equation
(using
.BR \ex ).
The default value is 35.
.
.TP
.B nroff
If this is non-zero,
then
.B ndefine
will behave like
.B define
and
.B tdefine
will be ignored,
otherwise
.B tdefine
will behave like
.B define
and
.B ndefine
will be ignored.
The default value is\~0
(This is typically changed to\~1 by the
.B eqnrc
file for the
.BR ascii ,
.BR latin1 ,
.BR utf8 ,
and
.B cp1047
devices.)

Besides the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are available:
.BR Alpha ,
.BR Beta ,
\&.\|.\|.,
.B Omega
(this is the same as
.BR ALPHA ,
.BR BETA ,
\&.\|.\|.,
.BR OMEGA ),
.B ldots
(three dots on the base line),
and
.BR dollar .
.
.SS Fonts
.B eqn
normally uses at least two fonts to set an equation:
an italic font for letters,
and a roman font for everything else.
The existing
.B gfont
command
changes the font that is used as the italic font.
By default this is\~\c
.BR I .
The font that is used as the roman font can be changed
using the new
.B grfont
command.
.
.TP
.BI grfont\  f
Set the roman font to\~\c
.IR f .
.
.LP
The
.B italic
primitive uses the current italic font set by
.BR gfont ;
the
.B roman
primitive uses the current roman font set by
.BR grfont .
There is also a new
.B gbfont
command, which changes the font used by the
.B bold
primitive.
If you only use the
.BR roman ,
.B italic
and
.B bold
primitives to changes fonts within an equation,
you can change all the fonts used by your equations
just by using
.BR gfont ,
.B grfont
and
.B gbfont
commands.
.
.LP
You can control which characters are treated as letters
(and therefore set in italics) by using the
.B chartype
command described above.
A type of
.B letter
will cause a character to be set in italic type.
A type of
.B digit
will cause a character to be set in roman type.

.SH NAME
eqn2graph \- convert an EQN equation into a cropped image
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eqn2graph
[
.B \-unsafe
]
[
.BI \-format\  fmt
]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads an EQN equation (one line) as input; produces an image
file (by default in Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the
Web as output.
.P
Your input EQN code should \fInot\fR have the \&.EQ/.EN preamble that
that normally precedes it within 
.BR groff (1) 
macros; nor do you need to have dollar-sign or other delimiters
around the equation.
.P
The output image will be a black-on-white graphic clipped to the
smallest possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.
By specifying command-line options to be passed to 
.BR convert (1)
you can give it a border, set the background transparent, set the
image's pixel density, or perform other useful transformations.
.P
This program uses 
.BR eqn (1),
.BR groff (1),
and the ImageMagick 
.BR convert (1)
program.
These programs must be installed on your system and accessible on your
$PATH for \fBeqn2graph\fR to work.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-unsafe
Run 
.BR groff (1)
in the `unsafe' mode enabling the PIC macro
.B sh
to execute arbitrary commands.
The default is to forbid this.
.TP
.BI \-format\  fmt
Specify an output format; the default is PNG (Portable Network Graphics).
Any format that
.BR convert (1)
can emit is supported.
.PP
Command-line switches and arguments not listed above are passed to
.BR convert (1).
.
.
.SH FILES
.Tp \w'\fB/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/eqnrc'u+2n
.B /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/eqnrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \|\fBetags\fP\| program is used to create a tag table file, in a format
understood by
.BR emacs ( 1 )\c
\&; the \|\fBctags\fP\| program is used to create a similar table in a
format understood by
.BR vi ( 1 )\c
\&.  Both forms of the program understand
the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada, Cobol, Erlang, HTML,
LaTeX, Emacs Lisp/Common Lisp, Lua, makefile, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Postscript,
Python, Prolog, Scheme and
most assembler\-like syntaxes.
Both forms read the files specified on the command line, and write a tag
table (defaults: \fBTAGS\fP for \fBetags\fP, \fBtags\fP for
\fBctags\fP) in the current working directory.
Files specified with relative file names will be recorded in the tag
table with file names relative to the directory where the tag table
resides.  If the tag table is in /dev, however, the file names are made
relative to the working directory.  Files specified with absolute file
names will be recorded
with absolute file names.  Files generated from a source file\-\-like
a C file generated from a source Cweb file\-\-will be recorded with
the name of the source file.
The programs recognize the language used in an input file based on its
file name and contents.  The \fB\-\-language\fP switch can be used to force
parsing of the file names following the switch according to the given
language, overriding guesses based on filename extensions.
.SH OPTIONS
Some options make sense only for the \fBvi\fP style tag files produced
by ctags;
\fBetags\fP does not recognize them.
The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-append
Append to existing tag file.  (For \fBvi\fP-format tag files, see also
\fB\-\-update\fP.)
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-backward\-search
Tag files written in the format expected by \fBvi\fP contain regular
expression search instructions; the \fB\-B\fP option writes them using
the delimiter `\|\fB?\fP\|', to search \fIbackwards\fP through files.
The default is to use the delimiter `\|\fB/\fP\|', to search \fIforwards\fP
through files.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-\-declarations
In C and derived languages, create tags for function declarations,
and create tags for extern variables unless \-\-no\-globals is used.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-defines
Create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions
and enum constants, too.  Since this is the default behavior of
\fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-no\-defines
Do not create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions
and enum constants.
This may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are tagged.
Since this is the default behavior of \fBctags\fP, only \fBetags\fP
accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-\-globals
Create tag entries for global variables in C, C++, Objective C, Java,
and Perl.
Since this is the default behavior of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP
accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-globals
Do not tag global variables.  Typically this reduces the file size by
one fourth.  Since this is the default behavior of \fBctags\fP, only
\fBetags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIfile\fP, \fB\-\-include=\fIfile\fP
Include a note in the tag file indicating that, when searching for a
tag, one should also consult the tags file \fIfile\fP after checking the
current file.  Only \fBetags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-ignore\-indentation
Don't rely on indentation as much as we normally do.  Currently, this
means not to assume that a closing brace in the first column is the
final brace of a function or structure definition in C and C++.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlanguage\fP, \fB\-\-language=\fIlanguage\fP
Parse the following files according to the given language.  More than
one such options may be intermixed with filenames.  Use \fB\-\-help\fP
to get a list of the available languages and their default filename
extensions.  The `auto' language can be used to restore automatic
detection of language based on the file name.  The `none'
language may be used to disable language parsing altogether; only
regexp matching is done in this case (see the \fB\-\-regex\fP option).
.TP
.B \-\-members
Create tag entries for variables that are members of structure-like
constructs in C++, Objective C, Java.  This is the default for etags.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-members
Do not tag member variables.  This is the default for ctags.
.TP
.B \-\-packages\-only
Only tag packages in Ada files.
.TP
\fB\-\-parse\-stdin=\fIfile\fP
May be used (only once) in place of a file name on the command line.
\fBetags\fP will read from standard input and mark the produced tags
as belonging to the file \fBFILE\fP.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fItagfile\fP, \fB\-\-output=\fItagfile\fP
Explicit name of file for tag table; overrides default \fBTAGS\fP or
\fBtags\fP.   (But ignored with \fB\-v\fP or \fB\-x\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIregexp\fP, \fB\-\-regex=\fIregexp\fP

Make tags based on regexp matching for the files following this option,
in addition to the tags made with the standard parsing based on
language. May be freely intermixed with filenames and the \fB\-R\fP
option.  The regexps are cumulative, i.e. each such option will add to
the previous ones.  The regexps are of one of the forms:
.br
	[\fB{\fP\fIlanguage\fP\fB}\fP]\fB/\fP\fItagregexp/\fP[\fInameregexp\fP\fB/\fP]\fImodifiers\fP
.br
	\fB@\fP\fIregexfile\fP
.br

where \fItagregexp\fP is used to match the tag.  It should not match
useless characters.  If the match is such that more characters than
needed are unavoidably matched by \fItagregexp\fP, it may be useful to
add a \fInameregexp\fP, to narrow down the tag scope.  \fBctags\fP
ignores regexps without a \fInameregexp\fP.  The syntax of regexps is
the same as in emacs.  The following character escape sequences are
supported: \\a, \\b, \\d, \\e, \\f, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\v, which
respectively stand for the ASCII characters BEL, BS, DEL, ESC, FF, NL,
CR, TAB, VT.
.br
The \fImodifiers\fP are a sequence of 0 or more characters among
\fIi\fP, which means to ignore case when matching; \fIm\fP, which means
that the \fItagregexp\fP will be matched against the whole file contents
at once, rather than line by line, and the matching sequence can match
multiple lines; and \fIs\fP, which implies \fIm\fP and means that the
dot character in \fItagregexp\fP matches the newline char as well.
.br
The separator, which is \fB/\fP in the examples, can be any character
different from space, tab, braces and \fB@\fP.  If the separator
character is needed inside the regular expression, it must be quoted
by preceding it with \fB\\\fP.
.br
The optional \fB{\fP\fIlanguage\fP\fB}\fP prefix means that the tag
should be
created only for files of language \fIlanguage\fP, and ignored
otherwise.  This is particularly useful when storing many predefined
regexps in a file.
.br
In its second form, \fIregexfile\fP is the name of a file that contains
a number of arguments to the \fI\-\-regex\=\fP option,
one per line.  Lines beginning with a space or tab are assumed
to be comments, and ignored.

.br
Here are some examples.  All the regexps are quoted to protect them
from shell interpretation.
.br

Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
.br
\fI\-\-regex\='/[ \\t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \\t(]+"\\([^"]+\\)"/'\fP
.\"" This comment is to avoid confusion to Emacs syntax highlighting
.br

Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line, broken here for
formatting reasons):
.br
\fI\-\-language\=none\ \-\-regex='/[\ \\t]*\\(ARCHITECTURE\\|\\
CONFIGURATION\\)\ +[^\ ]*\ +OF/'\ \-\-regex\='/[\ \\t]*\\
\\(ATTRIBUTE\\|ENTITY\\|FUNCTION\\|PACKAGE\\(\ BODY\\)?\\
\\|PROCEDURE\\|PROCESS\\|TYPE\\)[\ \\t]+\\([^\ \\t(]+\\)/\\3/'\fP
.br

Tag TCL files (this last example shows the usage of a \fItagregexp\fP):
.br
\fI\-\-lang\=none \-\-regex\='/proc[\ \\t]+\\([^\ \\t]+\\)/\\1/'\fP

.br
A regexp can be preceded by {\fIlang\fP}, thus restricting it to match
lines of files of the specified language.  Use \fBetags \-\-help\fP to obtain
a list of the recognised languages.  This feature is particularly useful inside
\fBregex files\fP.  A regex file contains one regex per line.  Empty lines,
and those lines beginning with space or tab are ignored.  Lines beginning
with @ are references to regex files whose name follows the @ sign.  Other
lines are considered regular expressions like those following \fB\-\-regex\fP.
.br
For example, the command
.br
\fIetags \-\-regex=@regex.file *.c\fP
.br
reads the regexes contained in the file regex.file.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-no\-regex
Don't do any more regexp matching on the following files.  May be
freely intermixed with filenames and the \fB\-\-regex\fP option.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-typedefs
Record typedefs in C code as tags.  Since this is the default behavior
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-typedefs\-and\-c++
Generate tag entries for typedefs, struct, enum, and union tags, and
C++ member functions.  Since this is the default behavior
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-update
Update tag entries for \fIfiles\fP specified on command line, leaving
tag entries for other files in place.  Currently, this is implemented
by deleting the existing entries for the given files and then
rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file.  It is often
faster to simply rebuild the entire tag file than to use this.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-vgrind
Instead of generating a tag file, write index (in \fBvgrind\fP format)
to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-cxref
Instead of generating a tag file, write a cross reference (in
\fBcxref\fP format) to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-h, \-H, \-\-help
Print usage information.  Followed by one or more \-\-language=LANG
prints detailed information about how tags are created for LANG.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print the current version of the program (same as the version of the
emacs \fBetags\fP is shipped with).
