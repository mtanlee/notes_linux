                        the mDataByteSize field will still say how much data would have been there
                        if it was enabled. Note that the contents of this structure should never be
                        modified.
    @param          inInputTime
                        An AudioTimeStamp that indicates the time at which the first frame in the
                        data was acquired from the hardware. If the device has no input streams, the
                        time stamp will be zeroed out.
    @param          outOutputData
                        An AudioBufferList in which the output data for the current IO cycle is to
                        be placed. On entry, each AudioBuffer's mDataByteSize field indicates the
                        maximum amount of data that can be placed in the buffer and the buffer's
                        memory has been zeroed out. For formats where the number of bytes per packet
                        can vary (as with AC-3, for example), the client has to fill out on exit
                        each mDataByteSize field in each AudioBuffer with the amount of data that
                        was put in the buffer. Otherwise, the mDataByteSize field should not be
                        changed. For streams that are disabled, the AudioBuffer's mData field will
                        be NULL but the mDataByteSize field will still say how much data would have
                        been there if it was enabled. Except as noted above, the contents of this
                        structure should not other wise be modified.
    @param          inOutputTime
                        An AudioTimeStamp that indicates the time at which the first frame in the
                        data will be passed to the hardware. If the device has no output streams,
                        the time stamp will be zeroed out.

    @enum           AudioDevice Properties
    @abstract       AudioObjectPropertySelector values provided by the AudioDevice class.
    @discussion     The AudioDevice class is a subclass of the AudioObjectClass. The class has four
                    scopes, kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal, kAudioObjectPropertyScopeInput,
                    kAudioObjectPropertyScopeOutput, and kAudioObjectPropertyScopePlayThrough. The
                    class has a master element and an element for each channel in each stream
                    numbered according to the starting channel number of each stream.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPlugIn
                        An OSStatus that contains any error codes generated by loading the IOAudio
                        driver plug-in for the AudioDevice or kAudioHardwareNoError if the plug-in
                        loaded successfully. This property only exists for IOAudio-based
                        AudioDevices whose driver has specified a plug-in to load.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceHasChanged
                        The type of this property is a UInt32, but its value has no meaning. This
                        property exists so that clients can listen to it and be told when the
                        configuration of the AudioDevice has changed in ways that cannot otherwise
                        be conveyed through other notifications. In response to this notification,
                        clients should re-evaluate everything they need to know about the device,
                        particularly the layout and values of the controls.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is running in at least one
                        process on the system and 0 means that it isn't running at all.
    @constant       kAudioDeviceProcessorOverload
                        A UInt32 where the value has no meaning. This property exists so that
                        clients can be notified when the AudioDevice detects that an IO cycle has
                        run past its deadline. Note that the notification for this property is
                        usually sent from the AudioDevice's IO thread.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIOStoppedAbnormally
                        A UInt32 where the value has no meaning. This property exists so that
                        clients can be notified when IO on the device has stopped outside of the
                        normal mechanisms. This typically comes up when IO is stopped after
                        AudioDeviceStart has returned successfully but prior to the notification for
                        kAudioDevicePropertyIsRunning being sent.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyHogMode
                        A pid_t indicating the process that currently owns exclusive access to the
                        AudioDevice or a value of -1 indicating that the device is currently
                        available to all processes. If the AudioDevice is in a non-mixable mode,
                        the HAL will automatically take hog mode on behalf of the first process to
                        start an IOProc.
                        Note that when setting this property, the value passed in is ignored. If
                        another process owns exclusive access, that remains unchanged. If the
                        current process owns exclusive access, it is released and made available to
                        all processes again. If no process has exclusive access (meaning the current
                        value is -1), this process gains ownership of exclusive access.  On return,
                        the pid_t pointed to by inPropertyData will contain the new value of the
                        property.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the number of frames in the IO buffers.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSizeRange
                        An AudioValueRange indicating the minimum and maximum values, inclusive, for
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyUsesVariableBufferFrameSizes
                        A UInt32 that, if implemented by a device, indicates that the sizes of the
                        buffers passed to an IOProc will vary by a small amount. The value of this
                        property will indicate the largest buffer that will be passed and
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize will indicate the smallest buffer that
                        will get passed to the IOProc. The usage of this property is narrowed to
                        only allow for devices whose buffer sizes vary by small amounts greater than
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize. It is not intended to be a license for
                        devices to be able to send buffers however they please. Rather, it is
                        intended to allow for hardware whose natural rhythms lead to this necessity.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIOCycleUsage
                        A Float32 whose range is from 0 to 1. This value indicates how much of the
                        client portion of the IO cycle the process will use. The client portion of
                        the IO cycle is the portion of the cycle in which the device calls the
                        IOProcs so this property does not the apply to the duration of the entire
                        cycle.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyStreamConfiguration
                        This property returns the stream configuration of the device in an
                        AudioBufferList (with the buffer pointers set to NULL) which describes the
                        list of streams and the number of channels in each stream. This corresponds
                        to what will be passed into the IOProc.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIOProcStreamUsage
                        An AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage structure which details the stream usage
                        of a given IO proc. If a stream is marked as not being used, the given
                        IOProc will see a corresponding NULL buffer pointer in the AudioBufferList
                        passed to its IO proc. Note that the number of streams detailed in the
                        AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage must include all the streams of that
                        direction on the device. Also, when getting the value of the property, one
                        must fill out the mIOProc field of the AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage with
                        the address of the of the IOProc whose stream usage is to be retrieved.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyActualSampleRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current actual sample rate of the AudioDevice
                        as measured by its time stamps.

    @discussion     These properties are also accessible by locating the AudioControl object
                    attached to the AudioDevice and using that object to access the properties of
                    the control.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyJackIsConnected
                        A UInt32 where a value of 0 means that there isn't anything plugged into the
                        jack associated withe given element and scope. This property is implemented
                        by an AudioJackControl, a subclass of AudioBooleanControl.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar
                        A Float32 that represents the value of the volume control. The range is
                        between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). Note that the set of all Float32 values
                        between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive is much larger than the set of actual values
                        that the hardware can select. This means that the Float32 range has a many
                        to one mapping with the underlying hardware values. As such, setting a
                        scalar value will result in the control taking on the value nearest to what

                        than the set of actual values that the hardware can select. This means that

                        values. As such, setting a dB value will result in the control taking on the

    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertySolo
                        A UInt32 where a value of 1 means that just that element is audible and the

                        until either the value of the control is set to false or the current IO
                        session stops and a new IO session starts. The property is implemented by an

                        same model will have the same value for this property but may have different
                        values for kAudioObjectPropertyName.
    @constant       kAudioObjectPropertyManufacturer
                        A CFString that contains the human readable name of the manufacturer of the

                        returned CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioObjectPropertyOwnedObjects
                        An array of AudioObjectIDs that represent all the AudioObjects owned by the
                        given object. The qualifier is an array of AudioClassIDs. If it is
                        non-empty, the returned array of AudioObjectIDs will only refer to objects
                        whose class is in the qualifier array or whose is a subclass of one in the
                        qualifier array.
    @constant       kAudioObjectPropertyIdentify
                        A UInt32 where a value of one indicates that the object's hardware is
                        drawing attention to itself, typically by flashing or lighting up its front
                        panel display. A value of 0 indicates that this function is turned off. This
                        makes it easy for a user to associate the physical hardware with its
                        representation in an application. Typically, this property is only supported
                        by AudioDevices and AudioBoxes.
    @constant       kAudioObjectPropertySerialNumber
                        A CFString that contains the human readable serial number for the object.
                        This property will typically be implemented by AudioBox and AudioDevice
                        objects. Note that the serial number is not defined to be unique in the same
                        way that an AudioBox's or AudioDevice's UID property are defined. This is
                        purely an informational value. The caller is responsible for releasing the
                        returned CFObject.

                        same model from the same manufacturer. Further, the identifier has to be the
                        same no matter on what machine the AudioDevice appears. The caller is
                        responsible for releasing the returned CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyTransportType
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates how the AudioDevice is connected to the CPU.
                        Constants for some of the values for this property can be found in the enum
                        in the AudioDevice Constants section of this file.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyRelatedDevices
                        An array of AudioDeviceIDs for devices related to the AudioDevice. For
                        IOAudio-based devices, a AudioDevices are related if they share the same
                        IOAudioDevice object.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyClockDomain
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the clock domain to which this AudioDevice
                        belongs. AudioDevices that have the same value for this property are able to
                        be synchronized in hardware. However, a value of 0 indicates that the clock
                        domain for the device is unspecified and should be assumed to be separate
                        from every other device's clock domain, even if they have the value of 0 as
                        their clock domain as well.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsAlive
                        A UInt32 where a value of 1 means the device is ready and available and 0
                        means the device is usable and will most likely go away shortly.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunning
                        A UInt32 where a value of 0 means the AudioDevice is not performing IO and
                        a value of 1 means that it is. Note that the device can be running even if
                        there are no active IOProcs such as by calling AudioDeviceStart() and
                        passing a NULL IOProc. Note that the notification for this property is
                        usually sent from the AudioDevice's IO thread.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceCanBeDefaultDevice
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is a possible selection for
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultInputDevice or
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice depending on the scope.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceCanBeDefaultSystemDevice
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is a possible selection for
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultSystemOutputDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyLatency
                        A UInt32 containing the number of frames of latency in the AudioDevice. Note
                        that input and output latency may differ. Further, the AudioDevice's
                        AudioStreams may have additional latency so they should be queried as well.
                        If both the device and the stream say they have latency, then the total
                        latency for the stream is the device latency summed with the stream latency.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyStreams
                        An array of AudioStreamIDs that represent the AudioStreams of the
                        AudioDevice. Note that if a notification is received for this property, any
                        cached AudioStreamIDs for the device become invalid and need to be
                        re-fetched.
    @constant       kAudioObjectPropertyControlList
                        An array of AudioObjectIDs that represent the AudioControls of the
                        AudioDevice. Note that if a notification is received for this property, any
                        cached AudioObjectIDs for the device become invalid and need to be
                        re-fetched.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertySafetyOffset
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the number for frames in ahead (for output)
                        or behind (for input the current hardware position that is safe to do IO.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current nominal sample rate of the AudioDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyAvailableNominalSampleRates
                        An array of AudioValueRange structs that indicates the valid ranges for the
                        nominal sample rate of the AudioDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIcon
                        A CFURLRef that indicates an image file that can be used to represent the
                        device visually. The caller is responsible for releasing the returned
                        CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIsHidden
                        A UInt32 where a non-zero value indicates that the device is not included
                        in the normal list of devices provided by kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices nor
                        can it be the default device. Hidden devices can only be discovered by
                        knowing their UID and using kAudioHardwarePropertyDeviceForUID.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPreferredChannelsForStereo
                        An array of two UInt32s, the first for the left channel, the second for the
                        right channel, that indicate the channel numbers to use for stereo IO on the
                        device. The value of this property can be different for input and output and
                        there are no restrictions on the channel numbers that can be used.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPreferredChannelLayout
                        An AudioChannelLayout that indicates how each channel of the AudioDevice
                        should be used.

    @header AudioHardwarePlugIn
    This is the CFPlugIn interface presented by a HAL plug-in. The HAL will create only one instance
    of each interface. This instance is responsible for providing all required services on behalf of
    as many devices of the kind it implements.

    The Initialize method is called to allow the plug-in to set itself up. At this time any devices
    of its kind and their streams can be presented to the system using
    AudioHardwareDevicesCreated() and AudioHardwareStreamsCreated(). The plug-in is also responsible
    for managing its own notifications, and may install any CFRunLoopSources it needs using
    AudioHardwareAddRunLoopSource() at this time as well.

    Teardown() is called when the HAL is unloading itself and the plug-in should dispose of any
    devices and streams it has created using AudioHardwareDevicesDied() and
    AudioHardareStreamsDied().

    The rest of the methods in this interface correspond to the semantics of their similarly named
    counterparts in <CoreAudio/AudioHardware.h>. The HAL basically passes these calls directly to
    the plug-in in this fashion.

    Plug-ins do not have to manage device or stream property listener procs. Instead, a plug-in can
    call AudioHardwareDevicePropertyChanged() or AudioHardwareStreamPropertyChanged() and the HAL
    will take care of calling all the appropriate listeners.
    
    Note that only version 4 or later plug-ins will be loaded into 64 bit processes.
    
    Starting in 10.8, this kind of HAL plug-in is deprecated.

    @header AudioServerPlugIn
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn is a CFPlugIn that is loaded by the host process as a driver. The plug-in
    bundle is installed in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL. The bundle's name has the suffix ".driver".
    When loading the plug-in, the host looks for factories with the plug-in type,
    kAudioServerPlugInTypeUUID. The plug-in provides an object that conforms to the interface,
    kAudioServerPlugInDriverInterfaceUUID.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn can provide the host with information that describes the conditions that
    must be met to load the plug-in. This is done through plug-in bundle's info.plist in a key named
    "AudioServerPlugIn_LoadingConditions". The value of this key is a dictionary whose keys describe
    the loading conditions for the plug-in. Currently, only the key named "IOService Matching" whose
    value is an array of matching dictionaries. The host will load the plug-in if any of these
    matching dictionaries match an IOService.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn operates in a limited environment. First and foremost, an AudioServerPlugIn
    may not make any calls to the client HAL API in the CoreAudio.framework. This will result in
    undefined (but generally bad) behavior.
    
    Further, the host process is sandboxed. As such, an AudioServerPlugIn may only read files in its
    bundle in addition to the system libraries and frameworks. It may not access user documents or
    write to any filesystem locations other than the system's cache and temporary directories as
    derived through Apple API. The host provides a means for the plug-in to store and retrieve data
    from persistent storage.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn may communicate with other processes on the system. However, the plug-in
    must list the name of the mach services to be accessed in the plug-in bundle's info.plist in a
    key named "AudioServerPlugIn_MachServices". The value of this key is an array of the names of
    the mach services that need to be accessed.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn may create user-clients via IOServiceOpen() for standard IOKit objects
    without restriction. However, if a plug-in needs to create a custom user-client, it must list
    the name of the class of the user-client in the plug-in bundle's info.plist in a key named
    "AudioServerPlugIn_IOKitUserClients". The value of this key is an array of the names of the
    classes.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn may also use network resources. However, the plug-in must declare this in
    its bundle's info.plist with the key named, "AudioServerPlugIn_Network". The value of this key
    is a boolean and must be set to true if the key is present.
    
    An AudioServerPlugIn provides the same property-based object model as the HAL's client
    framework. The basic objects and properties are defined in <CoreAudio/AudioHardwareBase.h> and
    are supplemented with properties decleared here. The plug-in is responsible for defining the
    AudioObjectIDs to be used as handles for the AudioObjects the plug-in provides. However, the
    AudioObjectID for the one and only AudioPlugIn object must be kAudioObjectPlugInObject.
    
    When the state of an AudioObject implemented by the plug-in changes, it notifies the host using
    the host routine, PropertiesChanged(). The only exception to this is for AudioDevice objects.
    AudioDevices may call the host's PropertiesChanged() routine only for state changes that don't
    have any effect on IO or on the structure of the AudioDevice, such as a change to the value of a
    volume control.
    
    For changes to an AudioDevice's state that will affect IO or its structure, the change may not
    be made without first making a call to the host's RequestDeviceConfigurationChange() routine.
    This allows the host an opportunity to stop any outstanding IO and otherwise return the device
    to its ground state. The host will inform the plug-in that it is safe to make the change by
    calling the plug-in routine, PerformDeviceConfigurationChange(). It is only at this point that
    the device can make the state change. When PerformDeviceConfigurationChange() returns, the host
    will figure out what changed and restart any outstanding IO.
    
    The host is in control of IO. It tells the plug-in's AudioDevice when to start and when to stop
    the hardware. The host drives its timing using the timestamps provided by the AudioDevice's
    implementation of GetZeroTimeStamp(). The series of timestamps provides a mapping between the
    device's sample time and mach_absolute_time().
    
    The host provides the plug-in's device access to several tap points into the system's mix engine
    to allow for a variety of features, including adding processing to the signal. The host breaks
    these tap points down into IO operations that the host asks the plug-in to perform at the
    appropriate time. Prior to starting IO, the host will ask the plug-in which operations are to be
    performed. Note that the IO operations are performed on a real time thread on a deadline. As
    such the plug-in must avoid avoid blocking and return as quickly as possible.

                        state related to IO for any reason, it must begin this operation by invoking
                        this Host method. The device object may not perform the state change until
                        the Host gives the device clearance to do so by invoking the plug-in's
                        PerformDeviceConfigurationChange() routine. Note that the call to
                        PerformDeviceConfigurationChange() may be deferred to another thread at the
                        descretion of the host.
                        The sorts of changes that must go through this mechanism are anything that
                        affects either the structure of the device or IO. This includes, but is not
                        limited to, changing stream layout, adding/removing controls, changing the
                        nominal sample rate of the device, changing any sample formats on any stream
                        on the device, changing the size of the ring buffer, changing presentation
                        latency, and changing the safety offset.
        @param          inHost
                            The AudioServerPlugInHostRef passed to the plug-in at initialization.
        @param          inDeviceObjectID
                            The AudioObjectID of the device making the request.
        @param          inChangeAction
                            A UInt64 indicating the action the device object wants to take. It will
                            be passed back to the device in the invocation of
                            PerformDeviceConfigurationChange(). Note that this value is purely for
                            the plug-in's usage. The Host does not look at this value.
        @param          inChangeInfo
                            A pointer to information about the configuration change. It will be
                            passed back to the device in the invocation of
                            PerformDeviceConfigurationChange(). Note that this value is purely for
                            the plug-in's usage. The Host does not look at this value.
        @result         An OSStatus indicating success or failure. Note that even if this method
                        indicates success, the Host may still abort the change later.

    @struct         AudioStreamBasicDescription
    @abstract       This structure encapsulates all the information for describing the basic
                    format properties of a stream of audio data.
    @discussion     This structure is sufficient to describe any constant bit rate format that  has
                    channels that are the same size. Extensions are required for variable bit rate
                    data and for constant bit rate data where the channels have unequal sizes.
                    However, where applicable, the appropriate fields will be filled out correctly
                    for these kinds of formats (the extra data is provided via separate properties).
                    In all fields, a value of 0 indicates that the field is either unknown, not
                    applicable or otherwise is inapproprate for the format and should be ignored.
                    Note that 0 is still a valid value for most formats in the mFormatFlags field.

                    In audio data a frame is one sample across all channels. In non-interleaved
                    audio, the per frame fields identify one channel. In interleaved audio, the per
                    frame fields identify the set of n channels. In uncompressed audio, a Packet is
                    one frame, (mFramesPerPacket == 1). In compressed audio, a Packet is an
                    indivisible chunk of compressed data, for example an AAC packet will contain
                    1024 sample frames.
 
    @field          mSampleRate
                        The number of sample frames per second of the data in the stream.
    @field          mFormatID
                        The AudioFormatID indicating the general kind of data in the stream.
    @field          mFormatFlags
                        The AudioFormatFlags for the format indicated by mFormatID.
    @field          mBytesPerPacket
                        The number of bytes in a packet of data.
    @field          mFramesPerPacket
                        The number of sample frames in each packet of data.
    @field          mBytesPerFrame
                        The number of bytes in a single sample frame of data.
    @field          mChannelsPerFrame
                        The number of channels in each frame of data.
    @field          mBitsPerChannel
                        The number of bits of sample data for each channel in a frame of data.
    @field          mReserved
                        Pads the structure out to force an even 8 byte alignment.

                    AudioStreamBasicDescription structure.
    @discussion     Typically, when an ASBD is being used, the fields describe the complete layout
                    of the sample data in the buffers that are represented by this description -
                    where typically those buffers are represented by an AudioBuffer that is
                    contained in an AudioBufferList.

                    However, when an ASBD has the kAudioFormatFlagIsNonInterleaved flag, the
                    AudioBufferList has a different structure and semantic. In this case, the ASBD
                    fields will describe the format of ONE of the AudioBuffers that are contained in
                    the list, AND each AudioBuffer in the list is determined to have a single (mono)
                    channel of audio data. Then, the ASBD's mChannelsPerFrame will indicate the
                    total number of AudioBuffers that are contained within the AudioBufferList -
                    where each buffer contains one channel. This is used primarily with the
                    AudioUnit (and AudioConverter) representation of this list - and won't be found

                        this flag is clear, it is implied that this flag is set if the

                        clear.
    @constant       kAudioFormatFlagIsNonInterleaved
                        Set if the samples for each channel are located contiguously and the

    @discussion
        The "canonical" flags are deprecated. CA_PREFER_FIXED_POINT is discouraged because floating-
        point performance on iOS is such that fixed point is no longer truly preferred. All Apple-
        supplied AudioUnits support floating point. Replacement should be done with careful
        consideration of the format being specified or expected, but often
        kAudioFormatFlagsCanonical can be replaced with kAudioFormatFlagsNativeFloatPacked, and
        kAudioFormatFlagsAudioUnitCanonical with kAudioFormatFlagsNativeFloatPacked |
        kAudioFormatFlagIsNonInterleaved.

    @abstract       These constants are for use in the mChannelLabel field of an
                    AudioChannelDescription structure.
    @discussion     These channel labels attempt to list all labels in common use. Due to the
                    ambiguities in channel labeling by various groups, there may be some overlap or
                    duplication in the labels below. Use the label which most clearly describes what
                    you mean.

                    WAVE files seem to follow the USB spec for the channel flags. A channel map lets
                    you put these channels in any order, however a WAVE file only supports labels
                    1-18 and if present, they must be in the order given below. The integer values
                    for the labels below match the bit position of the label in the USB bitmap and
                    thus also the WAVE file bitmap.

	@header AUCustomViewPersistentData
	This file specifies a protocol that cocoa-based audio unit views will implement. Audio Unit hosts will call these methods to manage view data that needs to be preserved between subsequent openings of an audio unit's custom view. The view data is an opaque dictionary and can contain any information that the view needs to preserve such as user selection, and interface state such as selected tab view items, etc.

	The host should retrieve the customViewData before closing the view. This can be saved as part of a document, or used to restore view settings by calling setCustomViewData prior to opening the view.

This property should set prior to opening the view. The au view should be written in such a way that it can store this dictionary and use its information when the view is opened and user interface elements are created. The view should retain this dictionary until it is finished with it, and should not release the dictionary. This dictionary is owned by the host.

 *  @discussion The <code>CBPeripheralManager</code> class is an abstraction of the Peripheral and Broadcaster GAP roles, and the GATT Server

 *              to other devices.
 *              Each application has sandboxed access to the shared GATT database. You can add services to the database by calling {@link addService:};
 *              they can be removed via {@link removeService:} and {@link removeAllServices}, as appropriate. While a service is in the database,
 *              it is visible to and can be accessed by any connected GATT Client. However, applications that have not specified the "bluetooth-peripheral"
 *              background mode will have the contents of their service(s) "disabled" when in the background. Any remote device trying to access
 *              characteristic values or descriptors during this time will receive an error response.
 *              Once you've published services that you want to share, you can ask to advertise their availability and allow other devices to connect
 *              to you by calling {@link startAdvertising:}. Like the GATT database, advertisement is managed at the system level and shared by all

/*!
	@header CFArray
	CFArray implements an ordered, compact container of pointer-sized
	values. Values are accessed via integer keys (indices), from the
	range 0 to N-1, where N is the number of values in the array when
	an operation is performed. The array is said to be "compact" because
	deleted or inserted values do not leave a gap in the key space --
	the values with higher-numbered indices have their indices
	renumbered lower (or higher, in the case of insertion) so that the
	set of valid indices is always in the integer range [0, N-1]. Thus,
	the index to access a particular value in the array may change over
	time as other values are inserted into or deleted from the array.

	Arrays come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have values
	added to them or removed from them after the array is created, and
	mutable, to which you can add values or from which remove values.
	Mutable arrays can have an unlimited number of values (or rather,
	limited only by constraints external to CFArray, like the amount
	of available memory).

	As with all CoreFoundation collection types, arrays maintain hard
	references on the values you put in them, but the retaining and
	releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that can actually do
	whatever the user wants (for example, nothing).

	Computational Complexity
	The access time for a value in the array is guaranteed to be at
	worst O(lg N) for any implementation, current and future, but will
	often be O(1) (constant time). Linear search operations similarly
	have a worst case complexity of O(N*lg N), though typically the
	bounds will be tighter, and so on. Insertion or deletion operations
	will typically be linear in the number of values in the array, but
	may be O(N*lg N) clearly in the worst case in some implementations.
	There are no favored positions within the array for performance;
	that is, it is not necessarily faster to access values with low
	indices, or to insert or delete values with high indices, or
	whatever.

/*! @header CFAttributedString
Instances of CFAttributedString manage character strings and associated sets of attributes (for example, font and kerning) that apply to individual characters or ranges of characters in the string. CFAttributedString as defined in CoreFoundation provides the basic container functionality, while higher levels provide definitions for standard attributes, their values, and additional behaviors involving these. 

CFAttributedString is not a "subclass" of CFString; that is, it does not respond to CFString function calls. CFAttributedString conceptually contains a CFString to which it applies attributes. This protects users of attributed strings from ambiguities caused by the semantic differences between simple and attributed strings.

Attributes are identified by key/value pairs stored in CFDictionaryRefs. Keys must be CFStrings, while the values are arbitrary CFTypeRefs.

/*!
	@header CFCharacterSet
        CFCharacterSet represents a set, or a bag, of Unicode characters.
        The API consists of 3 groups:
        1) creation/manipulation of CFCharacterSet instances,
        2) query of a single Unicode character membership,
        and 3) bitmap representation related (reading/writing).
        Conceptually, CFCharacterSet is a 136K byte bitmap array of
        which each bit represents a Unicode code point.  It could
        contain the Unicode characters in ISO 10646 Basic Multilingual
        Plane (BMP) and characters in Plane 1 through Plane 16
        accessible via surrogate paris in the Unicode Transformation
        Format, 16-bit encoding form (UTF-16).  In other words, it can
        store values from 0x00000 to 0x10FFFF in the Unicode
        Transformation Format, 32-bit encoding form (UTF-32).  However,
        in general, how CFCharacterSet stores the information is an
        implementation detail.  Note even CFData used for the external
        bitmap representation rarely has 136K byte.  For detailed
        discussion of the external bitmap representation, refer to the
        comments for CFCharacterSetCreateWithBitmapRepresentation below.
        Note that the existance of non-BMP characters in a character set
        does not imply the membership of the corresponding surrogate
        characters.  For example, a character set with U+10000 does not
        match with U+D800.

/*!
	@header CFDictionary
	CFDictionary implements a container which pairs pointer-sized keys
	with pointer-sized values. Values are accessed via arbitrary
	user-defined keys. A CFDictionary differs from a CFArray in that
	the key used to access a particular value in the dictionary remains
	the same as values are added to or removed from the dictionary,
	unless a value associated with its particular key is replaced or
	removed. In a CFArray, the key (or index) used to retrieve a
	particular value can change over time as values are added to or
	deleted from the array. Also unlike an array, there is no ordering
	among values in a dictionary. To enable later retrieval of a value,
	the key of the key-value pair should be constant (or treated as
	constant); if the key changes after being used to put a value in
	the dictionary, the value may not be retrievable. The keys of a
	dictionary form a set; that is, no two keys which are equal to
	one another are present in the dictionary at any time.

	Dictionaries come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have
	values added to them or removed from them after the dictionary is
	created, and mutable, to which you can add values or from which
	remove values. Mutable dictionaries can have an unlimited number
	of values (or rather, limited only by constraints external to
	CFDictionary, like the amount of available memory).

	As with all CoreFoundation collection types, dictionaries maintain
	hard references on the values you put in them, but the retaining and
	releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that can actually do
	whatever the user wants (for example, nothing).

	Although a particular implementation of CFDictionary may not use
	hashing and a hash table for storage of the values, the keys have
	a hash-code generating function defined for them, and a function
	to test for equality of two keys. These two functions together
	must maintain the invariant that if equal(X, Y), then hash(X) ==
	hash(Y). Note that the converse will not generally be true (but
	the contrapositive, if hash(X) != hash(Y), then !equal(X, Y),
	will be as required by Boolean logic). If the hash() and equal()
	key callbacks are NULL, the key is used as a pointer-sized integer,
	and pointer equality is used. Care should be taken to provide a
	hash() callback which will compute sufficiently dispersed hash
	codes for the key set for best performance.

	Computational Complexity
	The access time for a value in the dictionary is guaranteed to be at
	worst O(N) for any implementation, current and future, but will
	often be O(1) (constant time). Insertion or deletion operations
	will typically be constant time as well, but are O(N*N) in the
	worst case in some implementations. Access of values through a key
	is faster than accessing values directly (if there are any such
	operations). Dictionaries will tend to use significantly more memory
	than a array with the same number of values.

	@param keyCallBacks A pointer to a CFDictionaryKeyCallBacks structure
		initialized with the callbacks for the dictionary to use on
		each key in the dictionary. A copy of the contents of the
		callbacks structure is made, so that a pointer to a structure
		on the stack can be passed in, or can be reused for multiple
		dictionary creations. If the version field of this
		callbacks structure is not one of the defined ones for
		CFDictionary, the behavior is undefined. The retain field may
		be NULL, in which case the CFDictionary will do nothing to add
		a retain to the keys of the contained values. The release field
		may be NULL, in which case the CFDictionary will do nothing
		to remove the dictionary's retain (if any) on the keys when the
		dictionary is destroyed or a key-value pair is removed. If the
		copyDescription field is NULL, the dictionary will create a
		simple description for a key. If the equal field is NULL, the
		dictionary will use pointer equality to test for equality of
		keys. If the hash field is NULL, a key will be converted from
		a pointer to an integer to compute the hash code. This callbacks
		parameter itself may be NULL, which is treated as if a valid
		structure of version 0 with all fields NULL had been passed in.
		Otherwise, if any of the fields are not valid pointers to
		functions of the correct type, or this parameter is not a
		valid pointer to a CFDictionaryKeyCallBacks callbacks structure,
		the behavior is undefined. If any of the keys put into the
		dictionary is not one understood by one of the callback functions
		the behavior when that callback function is used is undefined.
	@param valueCallBacks A pointer to a CFDictionaryValueCallBacks structure
		initialized with the callbacks for the dictionary to use on
		each value in the dictionary. The retain callback will be used
		within this function, for example, to retain all of the new
		values from the values C array. A copy of the contents of the
		callbacks structure is made, so that a pointer to a structure
		on the stack can be passed in, or can be reused for multiple
		dictionary creations. If the version field of this callbacks
		structure is not one of the defined ones for CFDictionary, the
		behavior is undefined. The retain field may be NULL, in which
		case the CFDictionary will do nothing to add a retain to values
		as they are put into the dictionary. The release field may be
		NULL, in which case the CFDictionary will do nothing to remove
		the dictionary's retain (if any) on the values when the
		dictionary is destroyed or a key-value pair is removed. If the
		copyDescription field is NULL, the dictionary will create a
		simple description for a value. If the equal field is NULL, the
		dictionary will use pointer equality to test for equality of
		values. This callbacks parameter itself may be NULL, which is
		treated as if a valid structure of version 0 with all fields
		NULL had been passed in. Otherwise,
		if any of the fields are not valid pointers to functions
		of the correct type, or this parameter is not a valid
		pointer to a CFDictionaryValueCallBacks callbacks structure,
		the behavior is undefined. If any of the values put into the
		dictionary is not one understood by one of the callback functions
